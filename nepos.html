<a href="nepos.jpg"><img src="/nepos.jpg" alt="A coin with the image of Julius Nepos (c)1998, Princeton Economic Institute"></a>

<h3>FAMILY AND BACKGROUND</h3>



<p> Julius Nepos was the son of Nepotianus, Master of Soldiers in the west ca.458-461, and

the nephew of the patrician Marcellinus, Master of Soldiers in Dalmatia ca. 461-468.  He

married a <em>neptis</em>, probably a niece, of the emperor <a href="leo1.htm&quot;"><b>Leo</b></a> (457-474).  He would have

inherited Marcellinus' support in Dalmatia, where, as Master of Soldiers himself, he

received an extant law of <a href="leo1.html"><b>Leo</b></a> dated 1 June 473 (<em>Codex Justinianus</em> 6.61.5) dealing with

marital property rights.  By 474 he also had received the title of patrician.</p>



<h3>ACCESSION</h3>



<p>  After the death of <a href="anthemiu.html"><b>

Anthemius</b></a> (467-472), not to mention that of <a href="olybrius.html">

 <b>Olybrius</b></a> (472), the

aging eastern emperor https://orb.rhodes.edu/encyclop/early/De_Imp/leo1.html"&gt;<b>Leo</b> would have viewed himself once again as sole emperor, with

the right to select a new emperor in the west.  Initially, he seems not to have made any

effort to name a western colleague, perhaps being forestalled by the example of what had

happened to <a href="anthemiu.html"><b>Anthemius

</b></a> and by not having a suitable candidate of his own.  In 473,

however, he decided to take action after the Patrician Gundobad raised <a href="glyceriu.html"><b>Glycerius</b></a>, the

Count of the Domestics, to the purple in March.  John of Antioch noted, "When Leo, the

emperor of the east, learned of the election of Glycerius, he appointed Nepos as general

of an expedition against him" (<i>fr</i>.209.2: Gordon trans., p.122).  <a href="leo1.html"><b>Leo</b></a> must have dithered

for some time before doing so, because by the time the decision was made the

approaching winter had closed the seas and it was too late for Nepos to take any action. 

For <a href="leo1.html"><b>Leo</b></a>, Nepos was a good choice: as in the case of the nomination of <a href="anthemiu.html"><b>Anthemius</b></a>, by this

means he not only could rid himself of a possible rival in the east, but also reassert his own

authority over the west.</p>



<p>At the very beginning of spring, 474, Nepos crossed to Italy, arriving at the the port of

Rome.  The chronicler Marcellinus stated,</p>

<p>"The Caesar Glycerius, who held the imperial power at Rome, was deposed

from power at the port of the city of Rome [i.e. Ostia] by Nepos, son of the

sister of the former patrician Marcellinus.  From Caesar he was ordained a

bishop, and he died... Nepos, who had expelled Glycerius from the

emperorship, was acclaimed as emperor at Rome ("<i>Glycerius Caesar

Romae imperium tenens a Nepote Marcellini quondam patricii sororis filio

imperio expulsus in Portu urbis Romae ex Caesare episcopus ordinatus est

et obiit... Nepos, qui Glycerium regno populerat, Romae elevatus est

imperator</i>": <em>Chron</em>.<i> s.a</i>.474-475.</p>



<p>John of Antioch said of Nepos,</p>



<p>"He took Rome, captured Glycerius without a fight and, having stripped him

of royalty, appointed him bishop of Salona.  He had enjoyed his rule for

eight months.  Nepos was immediately appointed emperor and ruled Rome"

(<i>fr</i>.209.2: Gordon trans., pp.122-123)</p>



<p>The <em>Anonymus valesianus</em> provides a similar report: "Therefore, at the order of the

emperor Zeno, the patrician Nepos, arriving from Constantinople at the port of the city of

Rome, deposed Glycerius from the emperorship and made him bishop, and Nepos was

made emperor at Rome" ("<i>igitur imperante Zenone Augusto Constantinopoli superveniens

Nepos patricius ad Portum urbis Romae deposuit de imperio Glycerium et factus est

episcopus et Nepos factus imperator Romae</i>": 7.36 <i>s.a</i>.474).  And the <em>Fasti

vindobonenses priores</em> not only confirm the location of the deposition, but also provide a

date: 24 June ("h<i>is consul. de imperio Glicerius in Portu urbis Romae; eo anno levatus est

d.n. Iulius Nepos VIII kald. Iulias</i>": nos.613-614; <i>cf.</i> <em>Auctuarii Hauniensis ordo posterior</em>,

s.a.474: "<i>Glycerius de imperio deiectus a Nepote patricio in Portu urbis Romae episcopus

ordinatur.  Nepos patricius in Portu urbis Romae imperii iura suscipit</i>").  The <em>Auctuarii

Hauniensis ordo posterior</em>, however, dates his accession to 19 June.</p>

<p>   The preceding sources indicate that Nepos did not become emperor until after the

formal deposition of <a href="glyceriu.html"><b>Glycerius</b></a>.

  But the mid-sixth-century historian Jordanes, however,

not only made it clear that as far as the eastern court was concerned, Nepos was the direct

successor of <a href="anthemiu.html"><b>Anthemius</b></a>,

 but also suggested that the investiture ceremony took place not

at Rome but at Ravenna, and before, not after <a href="glyceriu.html"><b>Glycerius'</b></a> deposition:</p>



<p>	"After Anthemius had been killed at Rome, Zeno, through his client

Domitianus, named as emperor at Ravenna Nepotianus' son Nepos, who

had been joined in marriage to his niece.  Nepos, having taken legal

possession of the empire, deposed Glycerius, who had imposed himself

upon the empire in a tyrannical manner, and made him bishop of Salona in

Dalmatia ("<i>occisoque Romae Anthemio Nepotem filium Nepotiani copulata

nepte sua in matrimonio apud Ravennam per Domitianum clientem suum

Caesarem ordinavit [sc.Zeno].  qui Nepos regno potitus legitimo Glycerium,

qui sibi tyrannico more regnum inposuisset, ab imperio expellens in Salona

Dalmatia episcopum fecit</i>": <em>Romana</em> 338-339).</p>



<p>Jordanes here uses the word "Caesar," and it may be that in this case a formal designation

was meant.  Just as little <a hrf="leo2.html"><b>Leo II</b></a> had first been proclaimed Caesar in 473 and then

Augustus in 474, and, indeed, just as <a href="valenIII.html"><b>Valentinian III</b></a> (425-455) had been named Caesar in

424, while the usurper Johannes (423-425) still ruled in Rome, before being raised to

Augustus in 425, Nepos likewise might have been granted the temporizing rank of Caesar

at Ravenna prior to the overthrow of <a href="glyceriu.html"><b>Glycerius</b></a>

 and Nepos' resultant raising to the rank of

Augustus at Rome.</p>



<h3>REIGN</h3>



<p> Little is known of Nepos' activities, domestic or foreign, during his brief reign.  In Italy,

Nepos issued gold solidi and tremisses at Rome, Ravenna, and Milan, as well as semisses

at Rome.  Silver also was struck at Ravenna, and bronze at Milan.  A token imperial

coinage even continued in Gaul, where a small number of gold solidi were issued at Arles

and attest to Nepos' efforts there.  In northern Gaul, small silver pieces in Nepos' name

were issued, perhaps by the quasi-imperial Roman rulers such as Syagrius of Soissons

who maintained themselves there.</p>



<p>In an unusual step for this late period Nepos even issued a few symbolic coins in the

names of <a href="zeon.html"><b>Zeno</b></a> and <a href="leo2.html"><b>Leo II</b></a>, attesting to the close ties between the two courts, even though,

as opposed to the case of <a href="anthemiu.html"><b>Anthemius</b></a>, 

he had no expectations of any concrete assistance

from Constantinople.</p>



<p>   Nepos' best-known efforts involved Gaul, where he named Ecdicius, the son of the

emperor <a href="avitus.html"><b>Avitus</b></a>

 (455-456), as his Patrician and Master of Soldiers.  Sidonius Apollinaris,

ever the optimist, wrote to his wife Papianilla about the appointment:</p>



<p>"The moment the Quaestor Licinianus, coming from Ravenna, crossed the

Alps and set foot on Gallic soil, he sent a message in advance to make it

known that he was the bearer of imperial codicils conferring the title of

Patrician on Ecdicius... Julius Nepos, true emperor in character no less than

prowess, has done nobly in keeping the pledged word of his predecessor

Anthemius that the labors of your brother should be recognized; his action

is all the more laudable for the promptitude with which he has fulfilled a

promise reiterated so often by another.  In future the best men in the state

will feel able to spend their strength with the utmost ardor for the

commonwealth, assured that even should the prince who promised die, the

empire itself will be responsible and pay the debt due to their devotion and

self-sacrifice..." (<em>Epist</em>. 5.16.1-2: Dalton trans., 2.69).</p>



<p>Other Gauls also seem to have felt a momentary enthusiasm for the new emperor.  One of

Sidonius' relatives, Apollinaris, fell afoul of the Burgundians as a result; Sidonius wrote

to him, "Venomous tongues have been secretly at work, whispering in the ear of the ever-victorious Chilperic, 

our Master of Soldiers, that your machinations are chiefly

responsible for the attempt to wih the town of Vaison for the new emperor" (<em>Epist</em>. 6.6.2:

Dalton trans., 2.55).  Only through the good offices of the Burgundian queen Caratena

was Apollinaris saved.</p>



<p>At the same time, Nepos also embarked on a diplomatic offensive against the Visigoths,

to whom he sent two embassies in an attempt to consolidate what remained of imperial

holdings in Gaul.  It seems that the Goths had occupied much of Provence in 473-474,

but a threatened imperial invasion led the Visigothic king Euric to be willing to negotiate. 

Nepos used as ambassadors not imperial officials but Roman bishops.  In the spring of

475 he sent to Toulouse bishop Epiphanius of Pavia, who previously had brokered a truce

between <a href="anthemiu.html"><b>Anthemius</b></a> and Ricimer.  

Epiphanius' biographer Ennodius reported that

Epiphanius returned "with the bond of peace having been undertaken" (<em>Vita Epiphanii</em>

91).  But, apparently the job was not yet done.  For in 475 Nepos dispatched to Toulouse

a delegation of four bishops from southern Gaul: Leontius of Arles, Faustus of Riez,

Graecus of Marseilles, and Basilius of Aix.  It may have been their job to work out the

actual terms of the treaty.</p>



<p>One individual who was very concerned in the progress of these negotiations was

Sidonius Apollinaris, now the bishop of Clermont and one of the leaders of the Arvernian

resistance against the Goths.  In a letter to Graecus of Marseilles, Sidonius gave his

impression of the four bishops' authority: "Through you delegations come and go; to you,

first of all, in the absence of the emperor, peace is not only reported when it has been

negotiated, it is even entrusted to be negotiated" (<em>Epist</em>. 7.7.4).  Subsequently, Sidonius

was shocked to learn that the episcopal embassy had ceded the Auvergne to the Goths in

exchange for a Gothic withdrawal from Provence.</p>



<p>Jordanes provides a rather confused account of the denouement of Nepos' Gallic

maneuvering:</p>



<p>"Therefore, Ecdicius, having fought the Visigoths for a while and being

unable to triumph, and having abandoned his homeland and in particular the

city of Clermont to the enemy, betook himself to safer places.  Hearing this,

the emperor Nepos ordered Ecdicius to leave Gaul and to come to him,

having made Orestes Master of Soldiers in his place... ("<i>Ergo... Ecdicius,

diu certans cum Vesegothis nec valens antestare, relicta patria maximeque

urbem Arvernate hosti ad tutiora se loca collegit.  quod audiens Nepus

imperator praecepit Ecdicium relictis Galliis ad se venire loco eius Orestem

mag. mil. ordinatum...</i>": <em>Getica</em> 240-241).</p>



<p>Even though Jordanes appears to blame Ecdicius for the loss of the Auvergne, it is clear

that its surrender was part of Nepos' own policy.  And it remains to be seen why Ecdicius,

a Gaul, would have been "recalled" to Italy if he had in fact been superseded anyway.</p>



<p> Elsewhere, meanwhile, Nepos was faced with renewed Vandal piratical attacks, and

likewise attempted to negotiate a settlement.  But, operating from a position of total

weakness, he could do little more than to recognize Vandal possession of all the

territories they occupied in Africa, Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, and the Balearics. </p>



<h3>EXPULSION</h3>

<p> Nepos' new Patrician, Orestes (whose main claim to fame was that he had served as a

<em>notarius</em>, or secretary, of Attila the Hun), soon turned against him.  Jordanes continues:</p>



<p>"This Orestes, having taken charge of the army and having departed from

Rome against the enemies, arrived at Ravenna, and remaining there he

made his son Augustulus emperor.  When he learned this, Nepos fled to

Dalmatia, and, deprived of his rule, he languished there as a private person,

where the emperor Glycerius recently had obtained the see of Salona ("<i>qui

Orestes suscepto exercitu et contra hostes egrediens a Roma Ravenna

pervenit ibique remoratus Augustulum filimum suum imperatorem efficit. 

quo conperto Nepus fugit Dalmatias ibique defecit privatus a regno, ubi iam

Glycerius dudum imperator episcopatum Salonitanus habebat</i>": Jordanes,

<em>Getica</em> 241).</p>



<p> The <em>Anonymous Valesianus</em> suggests that the "enemy" sought by Orestes was none

other than Nepos hlmself: "Soon Nepos arrived at Ravenna, pursued by the Patrician

Orestes and his army.  Fearing the arrival of Orestes, Nepos boarded a ship and fled to

Salona" ("<i>mox veniens Ravennam, quem persequens Orestes patricius cum exercitu,

metuens Nepos adventum Orestis, ascendens navem fugam petit ad Salonam</i>": 7.36

<i>s.a</i>.474).  The <em>Auctuarii Hauniensis ordo prior</em> adds a few twists of its own: </p>



<p>"While Nepos was in the city, the Patrician Orestes was sent against him

with the main force of the army.  But because Nepos dared not undertake

the business of resisting in such desperate conditions, he fled to Dalmatia in

his ships.  When Nepos had fled Italy and departed from the city, Orestes

assumed the primacy and all the authority for himself and made his son

Augustulus emperor at Ravenna" ("N<i>epote apud urbem residente Orestes

patricius cum robore exercitus contra eum mittitur.  sed cum desperatae rei

negotium resistendo sumere non auderet, ad Dalmatias navigiis fugit.  cum

Nepos fugiens Italiam ac urbem reliquisset, Orestes primatum omnemque

sibi vindicans dignitatem Augustulum filium suum apud Ravennam positum

imperatorem facit, ipse vero omnem curam externorum praesidiorum gerit</i>":

<i>s.a</i>.475; <i>cf</i>. <em>Auctarii Hauniensis ordo posterior</em>: "<i>Nepos cum ab Oreste

patricio cum exercitu persequeretur, fugiens ad Dalmatias usque navigavit</i>":

<i>s.a</i>.475).</p>



<p>If one accepts that in this passage the term "<i>urbs</i>" refers to Ravenna, and not, as is usually

the case, to Rome, then it would seem once again that Nepos took refuge in Ravenna

when faced by Orestes' revolt.</p>



<p>Other, briefer, sources provide a little clarification.  The <em>Fasti vindobonenses priores</em>,

for example, confirm that Nepos took flight from Ravenna after the arrival of Orestes: "In

this year, on 28 August, the Patrician Orestes entered Ravenna with his army and the

emperor Nepos fled to Dalmatia" ("h<i>is cons. introivit Ravennam patricius Orestes cum

exercitu et fugavit imp. Nepos ad Dalmatias V kl. Septemb.</i>": no.615, <i>s.a</i>.475).  Jordanes

says simply, "In the western empire, Orestes put the emperor Nepos to flight and

established his own son Augustulus on the throne" ("<i>parte vero Hesperia Nepotem

imperatorem Orestes fugatum Augustulum suum filium in imperium conlocavit</i>":

Jordanes, <em>Romana</em>  344); and Count Marcellinus likewise recalled, "As soon as Nepos

had been put to flight, Orestes set his son Augustulus on the throne" ("<i>Nepote Orestes

protinus effugato Augustulum filium suum in imperium conlocavit</i>": <em>Chron</em>. s.a.475).</p>



<p> These accounts, taken together, raise more questions than they answer.  Why did Nepos

replace Ecdicius with Orestes, when the first move of the latter was to seize Ravenna and

raise a pretender to the throne?  Who were the "enemies" against whom Orestes was

being sent (Jordanes)?  Who "sent" Orestes against Nepos (<em>Auctuarium Hauniensis</em>)?  In

default of additional information, one can only speculate.  One possible reconstruction

might be that the Senate of Rome was up to its old tricks and, as in the days of

 <a href="avitus.html"><b>Avitus</b></a>

(455-456), became involved in an insurrection against a foreign emperor.  Like 

<a href="avitus.html"><b>Avitus</b></a>,

Nepos retreated north and occupied Ravenna.  He recalled Ecdicius from Gaul not in

disgrace, but as support against a domestic rival, just as 

<a href="anthemiu.html"><b>Anthemius</b></a> had summoned

Bilimer against Ricimer.  After the loss of Ravenna, Nepos then fled the country, just as

 <a href="avitus.html"><b>Avitus</b></a> had done.  Ecdicius, meanwhile, 

simply disappeared from history.</p>



<h3>"SECOND" REIGN</h3>



<p>In September, 476, <a href="auggiero.html"><b>Romulus Augustulus</b></a>

 was forced into retirement by the barbarian

general Odovacar.  <a href="auggiero.html"><b>Romulus'</b></a> 

last official act was to forward a "letter of resignation" to

the eastern emperor <a href="zeno.html"><b>Zeno</b></a>.  At the same time, <a href="zeno.html"><b>Zeno</b></a> also received a letter from Nepos

requesting his assistance, as reported by the Byzantine historian Malchus:</p>



<p>"When Augustus, the son of Orestes, heard that Zeno, having expelled

Basiliscus, had again gained the kingship of the east, he caused the Senate

to send an embassy to tell Zeno that they had no need of a separate empire

but that a single common emperor would be sufficient for both territories,

and, moreover, that Odovacar had been chosen by them as a suitable man to

safeguard their affairs, since he had political understanding along with

military skill; they asked Zeno to award Odovacar the patrician honor and

grant him the government of the Italies.  The men from the Senate in Rome

reached Byzantium carrying these messages.  On the same day messengers

from Nepos also came to congratulate Zeno in the recent events concerning

this restoration, and at the same time to ask him zealously to help Nepos, a

man who had suffered equal misfortunes, in the recovery of his empire. 

They asked that he grant money and an army for this purpose and that he

co-operate in his restoration in any other ways that might be necessary. 

Nepos had sent the men to say these things.  Zeno gave the following

answer to those arrivals and to the men from the Senate: the western

Romans had received two men from the eastern Empire and had driven one

out, Nepos, and killed the other, Anthemius.  Now, he said, they knew what

ought to be done.  While their emperor was still alive, they should hold no

other thought than to receive him back on his return.  To the barbarians he

replied that it would be well if Odovacar were to receive the patrician rank

from the emperor Nepos and that he himself would grant it unless Nepos

granted it first.  He commended him in that he had displayed this initial

instance of guarding good order, suitable to the Romans, and trusted for this

reason that, if he truly wished to act with justice, he would quickly receive

back the emperor [sc. Nepos] who had given him his positon of honor.  He

sent a royal epistle about what he desired to Odovacar and in this letter

named him a patrician.  Zeno gave this help to Nepos, pitying his sufferings

because of his own, and holding to the principle that the common lot of

fortune is to grieve with the unfortunate.  At the same time Verina also

joined in urging this, giving a helping hand to the wife of Nepos, her

relative" (<i>fr</i>. 10: Gordon trans., pp.127-128).</p>



<p>This account again attests to the behind-the-scenes activities of the Senate of Rome,

which, having instigated the exile of one emperor and the retirement of another, now was

working hand-in-glove with Odovacar to keep imperial oversight at a safe distance.</p>



<p>In 477, Zeno also received an embassy from Gaul: "After the overthrow of Nepos,

emperor of Rome, and expulsion of Augustulus, Odovacar became master of Italy and of

Rome itself.  When the western Gauls rebelled against him, they and Odovacar both sent

embassies to <a href="zeno.html"><b>Zeno</b></a>, but <a href="zeno.html"><b>Zeno</b></a> inclined rather toward Odovacar" (Candidus <i>fr</i>.1: Gordon

trans., p.128).  It is difficult to see what the Gauls could have based their appeal on if not

a restoration of Nepos.  <a href="zeno.html"><b>Zeno</b></a> was placed in the position of having to refuse, for to take

their side would have meant war with Odovacar, a step he clearly was unprepared to take.</p>



<p>In Dalmatia, Nepos maintained his claim to the western throne.  He even may have

issued solidi and tremisses at Salona ca.475/477, and it has been suggested that after

<a href="auggiero.html"><b>Romulus'</b></a>

 abdication Odovacar provided him with a token pension.  Odovacar also seems

to have found it convenient to continue to "recognize" Nepos, at least on the coinage, for

during the period 477-480 gold tremisses continued to be issued at Milan and Ravenna in

the names of both Nepos and <a href="zeno.html"><b>Zeno</b></a>.  This would have allowed the Italian government to

provide for its own coinage needs without further offending any of the claimants to the

imperial throne.</p>



<h3>DEATH</h3>



<p> Nepos' death was only briefly noted in sources that could not even agree on its date. 

The <em>Auctarii Hauniensis ordo prior</em> recorded under the year 480, "The emperor Nepos,

while he was ruling in Dalmatia and was attempting to grasp the sceptre of his assumed

honor, was killed on 22 June by his own supporters, pierced by unexpected blows"

("<i>Nepos imperator cum Dalmatis imperaret et sumpti honoris sceptra firmare conaretur, a

suis improvisis ictibus confossus interiit X k. Iul.</i>").  The <em>Auctarii Hauniensis ordo

posterior</em> dates the same event to 25 April ("<i>Nepos imperator cum in Dalmatiis imperii

sui sceptra firmare conaretur, a suis occiditur VII k. Mai</i>").  The <em>Fasti vindobonenses

priores</em> offer yet another date: "In this year the emperor Nepos was killed on 9 May"

("<i>"his cons. occiditur Nepos imp. VII idus Maias</i>": no.626, <i>s.a</i>.480).  And the <em>Anonymus

Valesianus</em> merely notes, "And he remained there for five years; afterwards he was killed

by his own supporters" ("<i>et ibi mansit per annos quinque, postea vero a suis occidi</i>":

7.326).  These varying dates may reflect the times the news was received in different

places; if so, then the earliest of them, 25 April, might be most nearly correct.</p>



<p>If these sources can be believed, in 480 Nepos was in the process of making an attempt

to recover the western throne in fact as well as in name.  If so, his Dalmatian supporters

would have none of it, and he fell victim to local intrigues.  The Byzantine chronicler

offers an ironic twist by suggesting (<i>apud</i>. Photius 78) that <a href="glyceriu.html"><b>Glycerius</b></a> himself was

involved in the conspiracy to murder Nepos.</p>



<p> Odovacar then took advantage of Nepos' demise, and extended his own authority into

Dalmatia.  Cassiodorus recalled, "At this time, Odovacar overcame and killed Odiva in

Dalmatia" ("<i>His conss. Odovacar in Dalmatiis Odivam vincit et perimit</i>": <em>Chron</em>. 1309,

s.a.481).  And the <em>Auctarii Hauniensis ordo prior</em> was a bit more specific: "King

Odovacar departed for Dalmatia.  When Ovida resisted him with an army, he was

overcome by Odovacar and killed on 9 December.  Once Ovida had been defeated and

killed, Odovacar extended his kingdom far and wide by battles and conquest" ("<i>Odoachar

rex in Dalmatiis proficiscitur, cui cum obsistere cum exercitu Ovida conaretur, ab

Odoachre oppressus interiit V id. Decemb. Odoachar devicto Ovida atque interfecto

regnum late proeliis et ferro extendit</i>": s.a.482).</p>



<h3>EPILOGUE</h3>



<p>   Nepos continued to bear the imperial title until the very end, and rightly deserves the

title "last western Roman emperor."  But by the time of his death he had become an

unwanted anachronism, an embarrassment to <a href="zeno.html"><b>Zeno</b></a>, who could not afford to support him,

and an obstacle to Odovacar, who had plans of his own for expansion in Dalmatia.  His

death, which brought to an end the long and distinguished line of western Roman emperors, 

passed with scarcely an acknowledgement.</p>
