<h3>Introduction and Summary</h3><p>Palmyra was a trading community near the margin of the Roman and Persian empires.  In A.D. 270-272, under the leadership of Zenobia, the dowager of its ruling house, and in the name of her young son Vaballathus, Palmyrene forces took control of Roman Egypt, Arabia, and parts of Asia Minor.  Although the Palmyrenes' actions were not (we believe) originally seditious in intent, <a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian</b></a> regarded the "Palmyrene Revolt" as a serious threat to his sovereignty.  He campaigned personally against the Palmyrenes, and he ranked his victory over them along with his recovery of the "Gallic Empire."   He reversed the largest extent of disintegration the Roman Empire suffered in the third century.</p>



<center><b>Background: Palmyra and Odaenathus</b></center><p>



Palmyra is the Roman name for a city called Tadmor in its people's own



language.  It was located near the edge of the Syrian desert, between Roman



Syria and Persian Babylonia, at an oasis watered by the Efqa spring.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn1"><b>[[2]]</b></a>  It prospered by organizing, guiding, and



protecting caravan routes for trade across the desert, especially between Dura



Europos and Emesa.  The Palmyrenes were ethnically Semitic (Amorite, Aramaic



and Arabic), but their business made it easy for them to adopt divers elements



of Greco-Roman and Parthian or Persian culture too.</p><p>



Palmyra's origins go back to the second millennium B.C.  The city lay in the



territory that, after Alexander the Great conquered the Persian Empire in 331



B.C., was held by Antigonos Monophthalmos, then Seleucus.  But the bulk of the



material and literary evidence concerning it dates from the first century B.C.



and later.  Palmyra lay beyond the region effectively annexed to the Roman



empire by Pompey in 63 B.C., although notionally it may have been included.



Appian suggests the Palmyrenes were more closely bound to Parthia when Mark



Antony tried to raid the city in 41 B.C. (<i>BC</i> 5.9.37-40).  Yet thereafter



political ties with Rome grew increasingly strong.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn2"><b>[[3]]</b></a>  Germanicus may have been the first Roman



to begin a meaningful governmental relationship, during his tour of Rome's



eastern provinces in A.D. 18, for the domestic tax law of Palmyra inscribed in



137 expressly cites a letter of his concerning assessment of tax on animals for



slaughter.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn3"><b>[[4]]</b></a>  In 75 Vespasian's governor



of Syria, M. Ulpius Traianus (the later emperor's father), tied Palmyra in with



Rome's eastern road system and defenses.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn4"><b>[[5]]</b></a>  Hadrian visited Palmyra probably in



129/30, and gave it privileges as a "free state."<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn5"><b>[[6]]</b></a>  Under Septimius Severus or possibly



Caracalla, at the end of the second century or the beginning of the third,



Palmyra was raised to the status of a Roman colony.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn6"><b>[[7]]</b></a></p><p>From the name Septimius/a used before the Palmyrene names of members of



Vaballathus's family, it appears they received Roman citizenship from Severus.



This inference in turn suggests that the family dominated Palmyrene affairs by



the 190s.  But it was Vaballathus's father Odaenathus who in the 250s and 260s



linked his prestige in Palmyra with spectacular support of the Roman regime in



the east and conspicuous Roman honors.  Yet, ironically, the precedents and



relationships he established formed the basis for the revolt of the 270s.</p><p>



A group of inscriptions at Palmyra, bilingual in Palmyrene Aramaic and Greek,



reveals a clear line of Odaenathus's ascendants: his great-grandfather was Nasor, his grandfather Nasor, his grandfather Wahballath, and his father Hairan.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn7"><b>[[8]]</b></a>  Odaenathus (Palmyrene Odainath) in his turn sired a son, Hairan, by a woman whose identity is not recorded;<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn8"><b>[[9]]</b></a> Hairan  was assassinated together with



Odaenathus in 267.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn9"><b>[[10]]</b></a>  They were survived



by Odaenathus's later wife Zenobia (Palmyrene Bath-Zabbai) and his son by her, Vaballathus (Palmyrene Wahballath).



Odaenathus's status as "chief of Palmyra" is commemorated on bilingual Greek



and Palmyrene inscriptions at Palmyra as early as 251 and 252.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn10"><b>[[11]]</b></a>  Some of the same inscriptions also



attribute Roman rank to Odaenathus, designating him  a member of the Roman senate.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn11"><b>[[12]]</b></a>  By 258, he appears with yet higher



Roman dignity as "of consular rank."<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn12"><b>[[13]]</b></a>



The Greek term <i>hypatikos </i>is transliterated within the Palmyrene texts.



It may reflect Roman recognition of Odaenathus's predominance among the



Palmyrenes, purely honorifically; but since the second century <i>hypatikos</i>



had been used to designate the governor of Roman provincial Syria, so it is



possible Odaenathus held that office.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn13"><b>[[14]]</b></a>



After the Persians captured the senior emperor, Valerian, at Carrhae,



Odaenathus did attack them as they withdrew from Roman territory in 260.  In



261 Odaenathus besieged the usurper Quietus, Macrianus's son, and his



king-maker Callistus/"Ballista" at Emesa and secured their deaths.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn14"><b>[[15]]</b></a>  In subsequent years, he campaigned



successfully in Persian territory; he is said to have won back <a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;n_s_c350.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=471&quot;)"> <b>Nisibis</b></a> to Roman



control, and to have penetrated as far as <a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;n_s_c350.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=471&quot;)"> <b>Ctesiphon</b></a>.  Jewish sources reflect a



campaign in Babylonia, in which Odaenathus pursued Palmyrene trading-interests



perhaps at least as much as Roman advantage against the Persians.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn15"><b>[[16]]</b></a>  Zosimus reports that Odaenathus led



Roman legions as well as the Syrian levies noted by other sources (Zos.



1.39.1).</p>



Odaenathus celebrated his Persian victories by assuming the aggressively



eastern-looking title "king of kings," <i>basileus basileon</i> in Greek and



<i>mlk mlk'</i> in Palmyrene inscriptions; he shared the title with his elder



son.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn16"><b>[[17]]</b></a>  The surviving Roman emperor



Gallienus confirmed Odaenathus's military authority in the eastern part of the



Empire.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn17"><b>[[18]]</b></a>  His exact office or title is



not directly attested, but Vaballathus's later claims to the titles <i>dux



Romanorum</i> and <i>corrector totius orientis</i> must have been founded on



Odaenathus's precedent.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn18"><b>[[19]]</b></a>



Odaenathus's titulature rose on a career of supporting Roman interests, but



devotion to Rome does not complete his story.  Peter the Patrician relates that



at one time Odaenathus sent camel-loads of rich gifts to the Persian king



Shapur, seeking alliance, but Shapur scorned the gifts and demanded complete



subjection (<i>FHG</i> 4.187).  Since Odaenathus is said to have claimed that



he had not injured Persian interests, this proposition evidently preceded his



attacks after the capture of Valerian, but by how long is not clear.  The



incident is interesting as it shows Odaenathus weighing Rome against Persia:



implicitly, considering Palmyra's advantage and his own independently, not as



an appendage of either great empire.  He may have been prompted by shifts in



local relationships of power.  More certainly, Odaenathus took the initiative



to change his position: he enhanced his prominence in Palmyra and Palmyra's



prominence in Roman affairs not only by the mere coincidence of Roman needs.



Whether or not Gallienus knew he could have lost Palmyrene assistance in the



East, he rewarded Odaenathus with extraordinary Roman honors in order to



encourage further support.  The fact that Odaenathus advertised his honors at



Palmyra, in Palmyrene and in Greek, demonstrates that he expected his



achievements to burnish his prestige before a local audience too.  Dedications



from Palmyrene subordinates and guilds, and favorable notice in the thirteenth



Sibylline Oracle, corroborate his success.



<p>Nevertheless, Odaenathus and his elder son were assassinated in 267.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn19"><b>[[20]]</b></a>  Most of the sources blame a kinsman



for the murders, but two late sources implicate Gallienus.  It is hard to see



how he, at least, could have expected to profit by the deaths: no break appears



in his relations with Odaenathus's successors, and the accusation seems only to



slander an unpopular emperor.  Probably Roman authors knew no more than the



fact Odaenathus died.</p>



<center><b>Zenobia and Vaballathus and the First Steps to Revolt</b></center>



<b></b><p>



On Odaenathus's death in 267, his leadership over the Palmyrenes and claim to



the titles "illustrious King of Kings" and <i>corrector totius orientis</i>



passed nominally to his young son Vaballathus.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn20"><b>[[21]]</b></a>  Vaballathus's age is inferred from the



conventions of Roman coin-portraits, which represent him as a prepubescent



youth in 270-272: presumably he was born within a few years of 260.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn21"><b>[[22]]</b></a>  Ancient sources identify Vaballathus's



mother, Odaenathus's widow Zenobia, as the true director of Palmyrene actions



and policies put forward in Vaballathus's name.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn22"><b>[[23]]</b></a>  Her childbearing implies that she was



born perhaps around 240.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn23"><b>[[24]</b></a>  Yet she



must have possessed a commanding personality and will, to have been able to assume Odaenathus's authority for herself and her son as effectively as she did.</p><p>Initially, Zenobia's and Vaballathus's control seems to have picked up smoothly



where Odaenathus's was terminated (e.g., Zos. 1.39.2).  But in 269/70 Palmyrene



forces broke into violent action.  Troops fought south through Bostra,



destroying the temple of Jupiter Hammon.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn24"><b>[[25]]</b></a>  Milestones honoring Vaballathus as



<i>rex co(n)s(ul) imperator dux Romanorum</i> 15 and 20 miles south of Bostra



along the road to Philadelphia mark further extension of Palmyrene control, and



damage at Petra may be attributed to the same Palmyrene campaign.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn25"><b>[[26]]</b></a>  The Palmyrenes invaded 
Egypt, where



their general Zabdas was assisted by a pro-Palmyrene Egyptian, Timagenes.  They



initially defeated a defending army of Egyptians, then were expelled by the



Roman prefect of Egypt, Tenagino Probus, with forces he diverted from an



expedition against pirates in Cyrene.  But when Probus encamped on a mountain



near Egyptian Babylon, at the upstream apex of the Delta, Timagenes was able to



cut him off and capture him.<a href="PalmRevo.html#fn26"><b>[[27]]</b></a>  Other



expeditions struck more tenuously into Asia Minor as far as Ancyra and



Chalcedon (Zos. 1.50.1).</p>



<p>In conjunction with these expeditions, a peculiar innovation appears at the



Roman mint of Antioch and at the provincial mint at Alexandria.  Both mints



operated normally through the reign of Claudius II, and the Alexandrian mint



issued coins of standard design for <a href="quintil.html"><b>Quintillus</b></a> in his brief reign and for



<a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian</b></a> in his year 1.  The Antiochene mint did not issue for <a href="quintil.html"><b>Quintillus</b></a>, and



for <a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian</b></a> issued first antoniniani with two "heads."  <a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian</b></a> appears on one side, with the



usual attributes and titulature of a Roman emperor.  On the other side appears



a beardless young man labeled <i>VABALATHVS V(ir) C(larissimus) R(ex)



IM(perator) D(ux) R(omanorum)</i> <a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn27"><b>[[28]]</b></a> After its first regular issue



of civic tetradrachms for <a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian</b></a>, the Alexandrian mint too issued



double-headed coins for <a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian</b></a> and Vaballathus jointly;<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn28"><b>[[29]]</b></a> the Greek titulature used for



Vaballathus corresponds to that of the Antiochene coins and the Jordanian



milestones, and to somewhat fuller formulas used to date Egyptian papyri.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn29"><b>[[30]]</b></a>  It replicates Odaenathus's senatorial



status and the Roman military authority he won from Gallienus.</p>



<p>Evidently the Palmyrenes obtained control of Antioch before they did of



Alexandria.  A proclamation issued in Vaballathus's name while the Egyptian



campaigns were advancing reflects another interesting facet of the revolt, that



the Palmyrenes expected to derive support from Zenobia's claim to be descended



from the Ptolemies, for Vaballathus describes Alexandria as his "ancestral

city."<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn30"><b>[[31]]</b></a>  This astonishing filiation



would seem a wild fantasy of the <i>Historia Augusta</i>, but for the fact that



Kallinikos of Petra, who flourished during the reign of Gallienus, addressed a



ten-book history of Alexandria "to Cleopatra": Zenobia is the only possible



dedicatee.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn31"><b>[[32]]</b></a>  The identification may



also relate to use of the Hellenistic name Antiochus for Zenobia's father, even



in Palmyrene inscriptions.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn32"><b>[[33]]</b></a>  Certainly



Zenobia did draw Greek intellectuals to her court and pursue an interest in



Hellenic culture;<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn33"><b>[[34]]</b></a> Vaballathus's



proclamation shows that she also exploited it to conciliate a broader public.</p>



<p>Why did the Palmyrenes raise arms within Roman territory?  Why did they act



when they did?  Although Zenobia and Vaballathus attempted to revive



Odaenathus's memory in Vaballathus, they did not strike when it was freshest,



when Odaenathus died.  They did not time their expeditions in conformity with



the vicissitudes of Roman imperial succession, for they anticipated Claudius's



death in 270.  The idea that they sought to rebel against Roman authority is



repudiated by the double-headed coins, which declare <a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian's</b></a> sovereignty



superior to Vaballathus's.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn34"><b>[[35]]</b></a>



Commercial interests may well have helped urge them into Egypt, where they had



long enjoyed trading contacts in Alexandria.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn35"><b>[[36]]</b></a>  Timagenes exemplifies the fact that



they also received local support.  In Arabia, later Arabic legendary history



places a figure closely based on Zenobia in bitter conflict with a coalition of



Arab tribes called the Tanukh and led by the sheikh Jadhimah.  Although the



story's vivid, murderous confrontations cannot reflect the whole truth -- the



very existence of the Roman empire on the periphery of the Arab struggle is



completely ignored, for example -- the legend could have been germinated by a



rivalry acute enough to precipitate the Palmyrenes' actions in 269/70.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn36"><b>[[37]]</b></a>  Local rivalries and allegiances with



Palmyra are attested by Arabic graffiti of the period.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn37"><b>[[38]]</b></a>  Odaenathus had won honors from



Gallienus by pursuing ends favorable to Palmyra, by aggressive military means,



in the default of Roman forces.  Zenobia, Vaballathus and their generals may



well have expected their own advantage also to be welcomed by the Roman



government.  The double-headed coins speciously proclaim a partnership: they



lay claim to central authorization in hopes to outface local opposition.</p><center><b>The Roman Reaction</b></center><p>



<b></b>Of course, the opposition of Tenagino Probus should have signalled that



the Roman government might not accede to Palmyrene ends.  The new emperor,



<a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian</b></a>, proved dramatically less complaisant than <a href="gallval.html"><b>Gallienus</b></a>.  The fullest



extant account of <a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian's</b></a> campaign against the Palmyrenes is given by



Zosimus (Zos. 1.50-61).  It dovetails roughly with the more capriciously



condensed and anecdotal account in the <i>Historia Augusta</i> Life of <a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian</b></a>



(<i>HA Aurel.</i> 22-31); the late antique epitomators and Byzantine



chroniclers provide important details both corroborative and supplemental.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn38"><b>[[39]]</b></a></p>



<p>Campaigns against Germanic barbarians around the Danube, in Pannonia and in



Italy kept <a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian</b></a> busy in 270/1.  But after inaugurating defensive



fortifications at Rome he led his army east again, crossing from Byzantium into



Bithynia and proceeding east and south toward Syria.  He dispatched a



subordinate, possibly the future emperor Probus, to recover Egypt.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn39"><b>[[40]]</b></a>  <a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian</b></a> himself and his army are said



to have taken Ancyra back from the adherents of the Palmyrenes easily, but



faced initial opposition at Tyana before the city was betrayed to him.  Authors



who dilate upon the episode use it to illustrate principles of just conquest.</p>



<p>Advancing further, <a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian</b></a> encountered Zenobia and a large army in the



vicinity of Antioch (Zos. 1.50.2), apparently to the east of the city along the



road to Beroa, in the plain before the village of Immae.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn40"><b>[[41]]</b></a>  <a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian</b></a> recognized that the



heavy-armed Palmyrene cavalry excelled his own, but also, acutely, that their



very armor could become a weapon against them.  He detached his infantry and



instructed his cavalry to wait till the Palmyrenes attacked, then pretend to



flee and lead a chase while the heat baked into the heavy metal.  After a



while, the Roman horsemen were able to mow down and trample their exhausted



opponents.</p>



<p>The survivors escaped into Antioch.  Zenobia's general Zabdas deceived the



populace by leading through the city, as if captured, a man who resembled



<a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian</b></a>.  Then the Palmyrenes evacuated in the night and made for Emesa.  They



left a detachment of soldiers behind, who established themselves on a hilltop



overlooking the road near the suburb of Daphne.  <a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian</b></a>, who had been



welcomed into Antioch, instructed his soldiers to use a testudo formation with



overlocking shields to defend against the Palmyrenes' advantage of height; once



the Romans thus were on the same level with the Palmyrenes, they were able to rout



and kill them.</p>



<p><a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian</b></a> and his victorious forces advanced south and east, and were welcomed



into Apamea, Larissa, and Arethusa as they came to them.  They encountered the



Palmyrene army next drawn up in the plain before Emesa.  The Palmyrene cavalry



outmatched the Roman, but instead of surrounding the Roman army they broke



ranks to pursue the Roman horsemen.  The Roman and allied infantry took



advantage of the disarray and wrought great slaughter.  Zosimus particularly



credits the Palestinian contingent's clubs and cudgels with success against the



Palmyrenes' metal armor.  The Palmyrenes fled into Emesa.  Once more their



leaders determined that it would be wisest to fall back, now to Palmyra.



Zenobia was unable to remove her treasury from Emesa in the retreat, so that



<a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian</b></a> took possession of it when he was welcomed into the city.</p>



<p>The <i>Historia Augusta</i> relates that <a href="aurelian.html"><b> Aurelian's</b></a> forces were harried on



their route to Palmyra by guerrilla bands of "Syrian brigands" (<i>HA



Aurel.</i> 26.1); nevertheless the army crossed the arc of desert successfully



and invested the city for a siege.  Minor engagements of archery are



mentioned,<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn41"><b>[[42]]</b></a> but mostly the two sides



settled in to await the other's running out of provisions.  Finally, however,



Zenobia set forth on camel-back to seek aid from the Persians.  <a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian</b></a> sent



horsemen after her; they captured her at the Euphrates.</p>



<p>During 272, as the dates on Alexandrian issues show, Antioch's and Alexandria's



double-headed coins of <a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian</b></a> with Vaballathus cease, and new issues appear



for Vaballathus and for Zenobia.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn42"><b>[[43]]</b></a>



They follow the standard format of Roman imperial coins.  Vaballathus assumes



the emperor's radiate crown and Latin titulature <i>IM(perator) C(aesar)



VHABALATHVS AVG(ustus)</i> on the antoniniani, the diadem and equivalent Greek



titulature on the tetradrachms.  Zenobia is entitled empress, <i>AVG(usta)</i>



and <i>SEB(aste)</i>.  Apart from the fundamental changes of titulature and



type, the tetradrachms conform with other products of the Alexandrian mint, but



the antoniniani spell Vaballathus's name differently, neglect the Antiochene



mint's system of control marks, and use dumpier flans: the discrepancies



suggest that they were minted somewhere else, presumably after <a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian</b></a>



recovered Antioch from the Palmyrenes.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn43"><b>[[44]]</b></a>  If this inference is correct, it dates



the first moment Zenobia and Vaballathus truly presented themselves as



rebelling from Roman domination.  Up until that point they had failed actually



to consult Roman authority, but apparently expected that the Roman government



would support the son to whose father it had granted authority over Roman



affairs.  <a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian's</b></a> reaction turned an irregular cooptation of Roman authority



into a true revolt.</p>



<b></b><center><b>Aftermath</b></center><p>According to Zosimus, a faction of the Palmyrenes still wished to resist



the Roman siege, but others, like the Antiochenes and the Emesans before them,



surrendered and welcomed <a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian</b></a> gladly (Zos. 1.56.1).  <a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian</b></a> displayed a



good victor's clemency to the vanquished citizens and took possession of their



gifts and the city's wealth.  He returned to Emesa to try Zenobia and her



adherents.  Most were executed, including the sophist Longinus (<i>HA



Aurel.</i> 30.3, Zos. 1.56.3).  He evidently was one of the Greek intellectuals



she patronized.  Zenobia was reserved to be led in <a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian's</b></a> triumph at Rome



in 274.  Latin authors aver that she appeared in the triumph, and even that she



lived thereafter in an estate at Tibur;<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn44"><b>[[45]]</b></a> some of the Byzantine sources know this



tradition, but also an alternative one that she died on the journey west.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn45"><b>[[46]]</b></a>  Vaballathus, unless he died on the



route toward Rome (so Zos. 1.59.1), simply disappears from the sources.



Presumably he did die, but not in any significant encounter.  Meanwhile, the Egyptian campaign was concluded successfully in late spring or



summer 272.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn46"><b>[[47]]</b></a></p>



<p><a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian</b></a> returned to Europe with his captives and booty.  By December of 272 he



won a victory over the Carpi along the Danube.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn47"><b>[[48]]</b></a>  Word reached him there that the



Palmyrenes had overthrown the garrison he left behind at Palmyra, and elevated



a kinsman of Zenobia's as emperor.  If the <i>Historia Augusta</i>'s



qualification of him as "parent" of Zenobia, despite the fact it names him



Achilleus (<i>HA Aurel.</i> 31.2), can legitimately be combined with Zosimus's



information that the usurper was named Antiochus (Zos. 1.60.2), it would appear



that the Palmyrenes elevated Zenobia's father to succeed her.  If so, the



Palmyrene revolt evidences an interesting path for dynastic authority to have



followed: from Odaenathus to his son and widow, thence to her blood relative.



Apparently no relation of Odaenathus remained at Palmyra.  <a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian</b></a> marched



back to Palmyra and quelled the second rebellion.  An inscription outside the



main entrance to the temple of the Palmyrene sun-god Bel records that some of



the priests had supported <a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian</b></a>.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn48"><b>[[49]]</b></a>



Its presence refutes Zosimus's exaggerated claim that <a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian</b></a> razed Palmyra



(Zos. 1.61.1), but the city thereafter remained relatively obscure.</p>



<p>The Palmyrene revolt has been claimed to illustrate a strong sense of regional



loyalty reemerging from under Roman dominance in the third century, and



asserting itself against Roman suzerainty.<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn49"><b>[[50]]</b></a>  But it would be better seen as a



partnership gone awry.  Palmyrene power grew up, especially under Odaenathus's



leadership, partly because the city marshalled great economic and military



robustness, but also because Palmyra's interests were married to Rome's.



Gallienus not only allowed, but even rewarded, Odaenathus's initiative in



pursuing the two sets of goals together.  Odaenathus was able to invoke the



prestige of his Roman honors in the view of Palmyra's neighbors and true



competitors.  A year or two after Odaenathus died, Zenobia and Vaballathus felt



the need to invoke the language of Roman authority for themselves, apparently



against hostile neighbors; they also appropriated the mechanisms of Roman power,



especially the Roman coinage and the provincial coinage of Egypt.  The way they



used titulature of Vaballathus on the coinage suggests that they sought only to



exploit established channels of authority to their own benefit, but in so doing



they assumed too much, and provoked <a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian's </b></a>response.  He in turn forced the



Palmyrenes into true rebellion.  By suppressing them, along with the "Gallic



empire",<a href="PalmRevo.htm#fn50"><b>[[51]]</b></a> <a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian</b></a> recentered the



power of Roman empire.  The fact that he was called upon to do so illustrates



that it had effectively monopolized structures of power in the Mediterranean



basin.</p>
