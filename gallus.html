<h3><b>Gallus Caesar (15 March 351 - 354 A.D.)</b></h3>







<center><p><b>Thomas M. Banchich</b></p></center>
<center>Canisius College</center>


<hr>



<p></p>



<p>Almost all we know of Gallus (<i>PLRE</i> I, pp. 224-225, <i>s.v.</i> Fl. Claudius 



Constantius Gallus 4) derives from literary sources, each of which 



brings with it its own problems.  For example, the testimony of Julian, 



Gallus' half-brother, comes mostly from the <i>Letter to the Athenians</i>, an 



apology of sorts for Julian's proclamation as Augustus and for his 



subsequent march against <a href="constaii.html"><b>Constantius</b></a>, 



while much of the detail of the 



church historians Socrates and Sozomenus stems from Libanius' <i>Or.</i> 18, a 



work hardly immune from rhetorical embellishment.  Libanius' letters  



and autobiographical <i>Or.</i> 1 are perhaps more trustworthy, when allowance 



is made for the relentless solipsism of their author.  The fragments of 



the homoiousian ecclesiastical historian Philostorgius and the 



derivative <i>Passio Artemii</i> (both edited in J. Bidez and F. Winckelman, 



<i>Philostorgius Kirchengeschichte</i><sup>2</sup> [Berlin 1972]), also provide extremely 



valuable information, though they often reflect Philostorgius' 



theological interests.  However, Ammianus Marcellinus' account is by far 



the most detailed.  Yet, at the same time, it is the most problematic 



due to the transparent identification of Ammianus with the interest of 



the senatorial class of Antioch; to his literary and rhetorical 



techniques and their employment in the presentation of the story of 



Gallus as an example of the workings of <i>hybris</i>, <i>ate</i>, and 



<i>nemesis/adrasteia</i>; and to Ammianus' wish to excuse the role of his 



superior officer Ursicinus in the treason trials that are the focal 



point of his narrative.</p>    







<h3>Gallus' Youth</h3>	



<p>Gallus, the youngest of three children of 



<a href="sibling.html"><b>Julius Constantius</b></a> 7 (<i>PLRE</i> I, 



p. 226)  and Galla 1 (<i>PLRE</i> I, p. 382), was born in 325/6 at Massa in 



Etruria (Ammianus Marcellinus 14.11.27).  Ammianus describes him as 



handsome, with blonde hair, but "differing from the temperate character 



of his brother Julian" (14.11.28.  <i>Cf.</i> Eutropius 10.13 and John of 



Antioch fr. 174, Müller <i>FHG</i> IV, p. 604).  His mother died prior to 331, 



by which time <a href="sibling.html">Julius



 Constantius'</a> second wife, the young Basilina (<i>PLRE</i>



I, p. 148), had died after giving birth to Julian.  His sister (<i>PLRE</i> I, 



p. 1037, <i>s.v.</i> Anonyma 1) had become the first wife of <a href="constaii.html"><b>



Constantius II </b></a>



around 335 (Julian 272 D, Athanasius <i>Hist. Ar.</i> 69, Eusebius <i>Vit. Const.</i>4.49), and her passing may have facilitated Gallus' fall in 353/4.Unlike his elder brother (Julian <i>Ep. ad. Ath.</i> 270 D), Gallus escaped the 



slaughter that followed the death of Constantine in 337, purportedly 



because he was suffering at the time from what was thought to be a fatal 



illness (Libanius <i>Or.</i> 18.10. <i> Cf.</i> Socrates <i>Hist. eccl.</i> 3.1; Sozomenus 



<i>Hist. eccl.</i> 5.2.9; Theophanes <i>AM</i> 5831, A.D. 338/9, ed. de Boor) or, 



perhaps more likely, because he was <a href="constaii.html"><b>Constantius'</b></a>



 brother-in-law (Athanasius, <i>Hist. Ar.</i> 69.1).  Julian (<i>Ep. ad Ath.</i> 271 B) mentioned 



years later that he and 



Gallus were told repeatedly that Constantius' actions were the result of 



a combination of misinformation and pressure from the soldiery, and that 



the emperor had come to regret his actions, which, in his mind, he 



linked to his childlessness and to military misfortunes on the Persian 



front.<a href="#1"><b>[[1]]</b></a>  </p>  



<p>It is often assumed on the basis of Ammianus 22.9.4, which refers only 



to Julian, that both Gallus and his half-brother were entrusted to the 



care of Eusebius, Bishop of Nicomedia (who was in some way related to Julian) 



in that same city.   If so, they may have moved to Constantinople in 



340, in which year Eusebius became her bishop.  After Eusebius' death in 



341, <a href="constaii.html"><b>Constantius</b></a>,



perhaps on the occasion of his journey to 



Constantinople in 342, sent the youths to Macellum in Cappadocia.<a href="#2"><b>[[2]]</b></a> 



However, such an extended period of contact between Gallus, Julian, and 



Eusebius is by no means certain, for, according to Socrates (<i>Hist. eccl.</i> 



3.1), before the transfer to Macellum Gallus had studied in Ephesus, in 



the neighborhood of which he had inherited considerable property, while 



Julian (<i>Ep. ad Ath.</i> 271 B) writes of Gallus' summons to Macellum "from 



exile in Tralles.".<a href="#3"><b>[[3]]</b></a>  From the date of the move to Macellum until March 



15, 351, when he became Caesar, Gallus was with Julian. </p>



<p>Sozomenus (<i>Hist. eccl.</i> 5.2) paints the situation at Macellum as a 



pleasant one:</p>



	



<p>... this imperial post was near Mount Argeus, and not far from Caesarea; 



it contained a magnificent palace and was adorned with baths, gardens, 



and perennial fountains.  Here they [Gallus and Julian] were cultured 



and educated in a manner corresponding to the dignity of their birth; 



they were taught the sciences and bodily exercises befitting their ages, 



by masters of languages and interpreters of the Holy Scriptures, so that 



they were enrolled among the clergy, and read the ecclesiastical books 



to the people.  Their habits and actions indicated no dereliction from 



piety.  They respected the clergy and other good people and persons 



zealous for doctrine; they repaired regularly to church and rendered due 



homage to the tombs of the martyrs.</p>



<p>Some of Sozomenus' picture most likely derives from Gregory Nazianzus' 



<i>Or.</i> 4., in which (23, pp. 116-118, ed. Bernardi) Gregory asserts that 



Gallus and Julian: </p>







<p>...had masters in all branches of learning, their uncle and sovereign 



causing them to be instructed in the complete and regular course of 



education; they studied also, and still more extensively, our own kind 



of philosophy, that which deals not with words alone, but which conveys 



piety by means of moral training:  living in intercourse with the most 



excellent of men, and in the exercise of the most pleasant of 



occupations, and which offers a great field for the display of virtue:  



for both brothers offered and enrolled themselves amongst the clergy; 



reading aloud the sacred books to the people, thinking that this tended 



not a little to their glory, and that piety was a greater decoration 



than all things else.</p>  



<p>Gregory also records (4.25-26, pp. 118-120) the brothers' contest with 



respect to a shrine of the martyrs, noting that an earth tremor caused 



the collapse of the portion built by Julian. Sozomenus (5.2) again 



echoes Gregory, though adding a precise identification of the structure 



as a martyrium of St. Mamas..<a href="#4"><b>[[4]]</b></a>  Julian's version of his six years at 



Macellum  contradicts much of the above.  At  <i>Ep. ad Athen.</i> 271 C-D he 



maintains (unconvincingly) that Gallus possessed a violent streak 



attributable to the forced stay a Macellum.  Neither he nor his brother, 



Julian alleges, was allowed the companionship of freeborn youths his own 



age.  Perhaps George, Athanasius' successor as bishop of Alexandria, 



supervised some aspects of the upbringing and education of the pair, for 



Julian (<i>Ep.</i> 107, ed. J. Bidez, pp. 185-186 ) comments on his access to 



George's library.  Probably in 347, <a href="constaii.html"><b>



Constantius</b></a>, while journeying from 



Ancyra to Hieropolis, visited Macellum (Julian <i>Ep. ad Athen.</i> 274 A).<a href="#5"><b>[[5]]</b></a> </p> 



<p>The acclamation in Gaul of <a href="magnent.html"><b>Flavius



 Magnus Magnentius</b></a> (<i>PLRE</i> I, p. 532) 



as Augustus on 18 January 350, forced <a href="constaii.html">



<b>Constantius</b></a> to launch a campaign 



in the west.  In order to maintain the imperial presence in the east 



during this expedition, he, being childless, decided to elevate Gallus 



to the rank of Caesar.  They would share the consulship three times, in 



352, 353, and 354.  For the ceremony of accession, which occurred on 



March 15, 351 (<i>Consularia constantinopolitana</i>, <i>sub annum</i> 351, p. 237, 



ed. Burgess), Gallus, perhaps accompanied by Julian, traveled to 



Sirmium.  As Caesar, he was renamed Constantius (Theophanes <i>AM</i> 5842, 



A.D. 349/50) and wedded <a href="constan.html"><b>Constantina</b></a>,



 <a href="constaii.html">



<b>Constantius'</b></a> eldest sister (Zonaras 



13.8.4, ed. Buttner-Wobst), to whom <a href="conniei.html"><b>



Constantine the Great</b></a> had given the 



title "Augusta" (Philostorgius 3.22 and 28) and who had some sixteen 



years earlier -- from 335 to 337 -- been the wife of <a href="hanna.html"><b>



Hannibalianus</b></a> 2 



(<i>PLRE</i>. I, p. 407), whom <a href="conniei.html"><b>



Constantine</b></a> had created "King of Kings and Ruler 



of the Pontic Tribes" (<i>Anonymus Valesianus</i> 36).  Gallus was twenty-five 



or twenty-six at the time.  The <i>Passio Artemii</i> 12 alleges that the marriage 



was meant to ensure Gallus' loyalty but it may have had at least as much 



to do with <a href="constan.html"><b>Constantina</b></a> who,



 besides having known power as <a href="conniei.html"><b>



Constantine's</b></a> 



daughter and <a href="hanna.html"><b>



Hannibalianus'</b></a> wife, had prompted the opposition of 



<a href="vetran.html"><b>Vetranio</b></a> 1 



(<i>PLRE</i> I, p. 954) to <a href="magnent.html"><b>Magnentius</b></a>,



 and whose hand had been 



sought from <a href="constaii.html"><b>Constantius</b></a>



 by ambassadors of   <a href="magnent.html"><b>Magnentius</b></a>



 himself (Peter the 



Patrician fr. 16, Müller <i>FHG</i> IV, p. 190).  The marriage, besides 



benefiting <a href="constaii.html"><b>Constantius</b></a>, extricated her from a dangerous situation in the 



west and placed her in a position from which she might control the 



younger and inexperienced Caesar.  On the other hand, it is possible 



that <a href="constaii.html"><b>Constantius</b></a> saw 



the marriage as a way to remove his intrusive -- 



perhaps treasonous -- sister from the volatile west.<a href="#6"><b>[[6]]</b></a>  If the mention 



in the <i>Passio Artemii</i> (11) of letters from <a href="constan.html"><b>Constantina</b></a> to her brother 



preserves a genuine tradition, it is possible <a href="constan.html"><b>Constantina</b></a> even initiated 



the proposal that she marry Gallus, whose union with her would produce a 



daughter, whose name and fate are unknown (Julian <i>Ep. ad Ath.</i> 272 D).</p> 	



<p>Julian alleges that <a href="constaii.html"><b>Constantius'</b></a>



 jealousy of Gallus began from the 



moment he proclaimed him Caesar.  If  Philostorgius (4.1) is to be 



trusted, relations between <a href="constaii.html"><b>Constantius</b></a>



 and Gallus were uneasy from the 



beginning, for a certain Theophilus (perhaps Theophilus 1,<i> PLRE</i> I, p. 



907, <i>consularis Syriae</i> in 354)  acted as mediator of a mutual 



non-aggression pact between them and, again following Philostorgius, 



managed through his initiative to keep peace between them.  The <i> Passio 



Artemii</i> 12 states specifically that Gallus was not allowed to select his 



own ministers, noting specifically <a href="constaii.html"><b>Constantius'</b></a>



 appointments of 



Thallasius 1 (<i>PLRE</i> I, p. 886) as Praetorian Prefect and Montius Magnus 



(<i>PLRE</i> I, pp. 535-536) as <i>quaestor sacri palatii</i>.  A fragment of an 



oration delivered (perhaps slightly later) by Himerius to <a href="constaii.html"><b>Constantius



</b></a> 



(Photius <i>Bibl. Cod.</i> 243, ed. Henry, IV, pp. 102-103) likely reflects 



<a href="constaii.html"><b>Constantius'</b></a>



official position regarding the new  Caesar.</p>    



<h3>Gallus as Caesar</h3>				



<p>After becoming Caesar, Gallus, while traveling from Sirmium to Antioch, 



visited Julian at Nicomedia (Libanius <i>Or.</i> 18.17, Ammianus Marcellinus 



15.2.7).  There Gallus may have summoned Julian to appear with him in 



the theater, an action which may explain the suspicions the rendezvous 



of the half-brothers aroused in  <a href="constaii.html"><b>



Constantius</b></a>.<a href="#7"><b>[[7]]</b></a>   Gallus arrived in Antioch 



on May 7, 351.  Socrates (<i>Hist. eccl.</i> 2.28.2) says his adventus was 



marked by the appearance of a cross in the sky.<a href="#8"><b>[[8]]</b></a>  



Probably early in his 



residence at Antioch Gallus moved the relics of the martyr Babylas into 



the precinct of Apollo at Daphne (<i>Cf.</i> John Chrysostom <i>Homily on St. 



Babylas</i> 101 and Sozomenus 5.19.12-13).  Zonaras 13.12 says that Julian 



later attributed Gallus' death to the desecration of Apollo's shrine by 



means of Babylas' remains.  Ammianus, whose account commences with 



events of the winter of 353/4, does not mention the transfer, an 



omission which suggests that the act occurred during the first year or 



so of Gallus' stay.  During the same period may fall a series of 



incidents related by Philostorgius (3.27), who alleges that accusations 



against the anomian theologian Aetius by his rivals Basil and Eustathius 



prompted Gallus to order Aetius' execution.  However, Philostorgius 



continues, Leontius, Bishop of Antioch, interceded on Aetius' behalf and 



the latter quickly became a favorite of the Caesar, while Gallus 



ultimately appointed Aetius to be director of the religious education of 



Julian, with the express aim of recalling him from impiety (paganism or 



Christian heresy?).  Aetius' role with respect to Julian may have 



something to do with events in 350, when Flavius Philippus 7 (<i>PLRE</i> I, 



pp. 696-697) escorted George -- perhaps Julian's instructor in religious 



matters and who had ordained Aetius as a deacon -- toward Alexandria to 



replace Athanasius (<i>Hist. Ar.</i> 51).  If so, when Athanasius maintained 



his see in Alexandria, George may have returned to Macellum.  This, in 



turn, might have meant Aetius' return to Antioch, where he is later 



linked to the ruin of Domitianus and Montius in 353/4.<a href="#9"><b>[[9]]</b></a> </p>   



<p> In 351 or 352, the <i>magister peditum</i> Ursicinus 2 (<i>PLRE</i> I, pp. 985-986, 



which fails to mention Ursicinus' role in the Palestinian campaign),  



crushed a Jewish insurrection in Palestine centered, according to 


Socrates (<i>Hist. eccl.</i> 2.33) and Sozomenus (<i>Hist. eccl.</i> 4.7) in 



Diocaesarea.<a href="#10"><b>[[10]]</b></a>   Jerome records -- for the year 352 but immediately 



following his notice of Gallus' proclamation as Caesar -- : " Through 



the murders of many thousands of men -- even those too young to pose a 



threat -- Gallus suppressed the Jews, who, having murdered soldiers at 



night, had seized arms for the purpose of rebellion ["<i>arma ad 



rebellandum invaserant</i>," which allows that the insurrection may have 



begun in the preceding year], and he put to the torch their cities 



Diocaesarea, Tiberias, and Diospolis and many towns" (<i>Chronica</i>,  ed. 



Helm, p. 238.15-21), to which may be compared Theophanes <i>AM</i> 5843, A.D. 



350/1: "In this year, the Jews in Palestine revolted.  They killed many 



other nationalities, both Hellenes and Samaritans.  They and their whole 



race were slaughtered by the Roman army, and their city Diocaesarea was 



razed to the ground."<a href="#11"><b>[[11]]</b></a>    Perhaps the brief power vacuum between 



Constantius' move west and before Gallus' arrival in Antioch convinced 



the discontents in Palestine that the time was right for rebellion.  



Socrates alone (Hist. ecc. 2.34) alleges that successes in Palestine 



prompted Gallus to consider a coup against <a href="constaii.html"><b>



Constantius</b></a>.</p>    



<p>John Zonaras (13.8.25-31)  offers immediately following his description 



of the battle of Mursa (September 28, 351), a detailed account of a plot 



by <a href="magnent.html"><b>Magnentius</b></a> to assassinate Gallus: </p>	     



<p>He sent out one of his servants to Antioch to kill Gallus so as to 



surround the emperor with cares and to divert his attention to other 



matters.  In order to remove suspicion from himself, the envoy lodged in 



the hut of a certain old lady.  This hut was built by the Orontes River.  



The Orontes was once called the Ophites, as some write; afterwards, 



however, it was called the Orontes because the son of Cambyses, King of 



the Persians, fell in.  His name was Orontes.  <a href="magnent.html"><b>Magnentius'</b></a> assassin 



prepared the plot against Gallus.  He attached to himself many heavily 



armed men of the place.  In the evening, with some of the conspirators, 



he had dinner at the house of the old lady and conversed with them 



fearlessly about his plan.  He despised the old lady because he thought 



she was too old to understand what was being discussed.  Since she was a 



lady of a steady nature, as it turned out, she seemed not even to hear 



what was said and kept everything to herself.  When her guest, heavy 



with wine, fell asleep, she secretly left her hut and went to the town; 



she revealed everything to the Caesar.  He sent some men to arrest the 



plotter, who, when he was under pressure, revealed the whole affair. 



Having escaped it, Gallus punished him and those who knew about the 



conspiracy (trans. DiMaio).</p>



<p>Ammianus 14.7.4 may provide a parallel:  "... his [Gallus'] propensity 



for doing harm was inflamed and incited by a worthless woman, who, on 



being admitted to the palace (as she had demanded) had betrayed a plot 



that was secretly being made against him by some soldiers of the lowest 



condition.  Whereupon Constantina, exulting as if the safety of her 



husband were now assured, gave her a reward, and seating her in a 



carriage, sent her out through the palace gates into the public streets, 



in order that by such inducements she might tempt others to reveal 



similar or greater conspiracies."  Zonaras' account may reflect 



rhetorical elaboration rather than access to informed sources, while 



that of Ammianus seems to mirror public knowledge of the incident as the 



result of the presentation of the informant to the populace of Antioch.  



There seems no need to posit any common literary source.  At any rate, 



the incident seems to fall soon after Gallus' arrival in Antioch, when 



the assassination could divert <a href="constaii.html"><b>



Constantius</b></a> and, if Ursicinus was then 



active in Palestine, the Caesar would perhaps have been more vulnerable 



to attack.</p>	



<h3>Gallus and the Persians</h3>		



<p>Philostorgius (<i>Hist. eccl.</i> 3.28) maintains that Gallus scored victories 



on the Persian front.  However, it is dangerous to base too much on the Arians'



testimony, for it survives only in the epitome of Photius, who may not 



represent accurately Philostorgius' point.  Furthermore, <i>Passio Artemii</i> 



12, deriving much of its historical detail from Philostorgius, does not 



attribute any actual victories to Gallus but says only that his 



reputation cowed the Persians.  Zosimus (3.1) makes the same point, 



perhaps reflecting an inference of Eunapius, whose History he closely 



followed, to explain Persian quietude during Gallus' reign.  Since 



Philostorgius, too,  seems to have known Eunapius' History, it seems 



likely that Zosimus 3.1 and <i>Passio Artemii</i> 12 reflect Eunapius, which, 



if so, gives added weight to the hypothesis that Photius' epitome 



inaccurately represents his exemplar.</p>



<p>In addition, there are other obstacles to positive modern assertions 



about Gallus' military successes in the east.  In 350, upon his 



departure for the west,  <a href="constaii.html"><b>Constantius



</b></a>  had placed Lucillianus 3 (<i>PLRE</i> I, 



pp. 517-518) in charge of anti-Persian operations (Zosimus 2.45.2 and 



3.8.2).  Revolution may already have been smoldering in Palestine, and 



perhaps the need for Ursicinus, Lucillianus' superior in rank, to turn 



his attention to the rebels explains Lucillianus' appointment.  Indeed, 



Sapor, upon the conclusion of a truce with the Romans, had withdrawn 



from Nisibis in 350 after suffering heavy losses in order to check 



nomadic incursions (Ammianus 14.3.1 and 14.9.3, Zonaras 13.713-14)  This 



seems to have changed the tactical situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> Persia from high 



intensity to low intensity threats (<i>cf.</i> Ammianus 16.9.1, Julian <i>Or.</i> 1.28 



D and <i>Or.</i> 2.66 D).  There seems, then, to have been neither the need nor 



the opportunity for the Caesar himself at the head of a field army to 



engage the enemy.</p>  



<p>Perhaps there were substantial clashes in 352 or 353, but, if the 



opening of the surviving portion of Ammianus' <i>Res Gestae</i> is an accurate 



guide, Gallus does not seem to have played any important role  in the 



soldier-historian's account of affairs prior to the campaigning season 



of 353/4.   That leaves only 353/4 as a time when Gallus himself might 



have personally engaged the Persians. Probably in early spring 354 



Gallus was going to lead troops from Antioch to Hieropolis, a regular 



jumping-off point for invasion of Mesopotamia.  It is unknown whether he 



ever reached Hieropolis or, if he did, whether the march was meant as a 



show of force or involved an actual engagement with Persian forces.  



Ammianus (14.7.5) refers to the matter with contempt.  Gallus' 



expedition is connected by some modern scholars to an aborted attempt at 



a surprise attack on Batne in Osdroene by the Persian commander 



Nohodares.  However, Ammianus synchronizes this with an early-September 



fair at Batne, which would seem to rule out any connection to Gallus' 



march to Hieropolis.   Late in 354 Gallus sent from Antioch the comes 



Orientis Nebridius 1 (<i>PLRE</i> I, 619), who must have only recently replaced 



Honoratus 2 (<i>PLRE</i> I, pp. 438-439) to relieve the city of Seleucia, then 



under Isaurian attack.  Ursicinus seems then to have been on the eastern 



frontier, perhaps in Nisibis, whence he had returned from presiding over 



the treason trials in Antioch.  Shortly before Gallus' fall in 354, 



<a href="constaii.html"><b>Constantius</b></a>



 summoned Ursicinus to Milan, where he had taken winter 



quarters, on the pretext of discussing how best to check Persian threats 



(Ammianus 14.11.4).</p>



<p>In sum, regardless of Ammianus' undeniable manipulation of events in 



his account of  Gallus' reign, there is little reason to credit the 



Caesar with martial successes.<a href="#12"><b>[[12]]</b></a>



</p><h3>The Death of Theophilus</h3>



<p>As would be the case later with his half-brother Julian, Gallus ran 



afoul of the senatorial class of Antioch as a result of his attempt to 



reduce the price of grain, which, due to drought or perhaps as a result 



of diversions to the military, was in short supply.  Ammianus (14.7.2) 



credits Honoratus with the salvation of the senators of Antioch, all of 



whom Gallus had sentenced to death in recompense for their opposition to 



this policy (did this episode figure in the replacement of Honoratus by 



Nebridius?).  The resentment of the lower classes at their perception of 



the role of the wealthy in the grain crises was clearly very high, and, 



either through his wish to provide a scapegoat or in consequence of his 



sincere judgment, Gallus -- as he prepared to depart Antioch for 



Hieropolis and the Persian frontier -- turned the anger of the people 



against the <i>consularis Syriae</i> Theophilus (<i>PLRE</i> I, p. 907). Ammianus 



vividly describes Theophilus' death, the mishandling of his body, and 



the burning of the home of the decurion Eubulus (14.7.5-7), while Julian 



(<i>Misopogon</i> 370 C) recalls the burning of the houses of the powerful and 



calls this, along with Theophilus' murder, the result of the justified 



but excessive anger of the populace<a href="#13"><b>[[13]]</b></a>



  Libanius (<i>Or.</i> 19.47) adds 



details: "After the death of Theophilus which that fine governor 



suffered at the hands of five copper-smiths at the chariot races quite 



contrary to his deserts, ... ."  At <i>Or.</i> 1.103, Libanius describes how a 



mob outraged Theophilus' corpse, sought the sophist and decurion Eubulus 



2 (<i>PLRE</i> I, p. 287) and his son, and, unsuccessful, burned their home.</p>  	



<p>Libanius (<i>Or.</i> 1.96) speaks of Gallus' murderous anger and records the 



arrest, followed by the release, of Zenobius, one of Libanius' mentors.  



On the next day, Libanius performed before Gallus, who then requested 



and received a panegyric. Libanius says that he delivered this panegyric 



in fear and that in it he mentioned that Zenobius, who, according to 



Libanius, was actually present, had often extolled Gallus' eloquence.  



Libanius describes (<i>Or.</i> 1.97) how Gallus "was delighted and stretched 



out his hand in token of reconciliation, and he did obeisance and kissed 



it, while we applauded, as you would expect in such a case when the 



emperor had freed an old teacher from fear" (<i>cf.</i> <i>Or.</i> 1.91 and 96-97).  



But subsequently a rival sophist encouraged a student to bring before 



Gallus charges of magic against Libanius, in anticipation that Gallus 



would execute him. Gallus directed the accuser to take the case before 



the courts, which he chose not to do.  However, Libanius adduces this as 



the explanation for the cool treatment he thereafter often received in 



public from Gallus, at <i>Or.</i> 1.99-100 saying that Gallus actually 



recommened that he leave Antioch and take an appointment in Thrace.<a href="#14"><b>[[14]]</b></a><b>



</b>  Ammianus' relentlessly hostile portrayal of Gallus and <a href="constan.html"><b>



Constantina</b></a> recounts how, with the help of informants, the royal couple destroyed a 


series of innocent victims on charges of conspiracy or the practice of 



magic.  Besides executions, there was a series of confiscations of 



property.  Ammianus even alleges that Gallus roamed the streets of 



Antioch at night incognito soliciting the views of passersby on their 



Caesar  (14.1.1-9).  Gallus also appears to have spent much time at the 



hippodrome, where he would have had a chance to woo the populace(Julian 



<i>Misopogon</i> 340 A).</p>



 <p>Ammianus (14.1.10) condemns the praetorian prefect Thalassius for his 



failure to check Gallus' alleged violent streak but allows that he did 



keep <a href="constaii.html"><b>Constantius</b></a>



 secretly informed of the Caesar's behavior.  Upon 



Thalassius' death in 353 by natural causes, <a href="constaii.html"><b>



Constantius</b></a> appointed 



Domitianus to replace him and sent him to Gallus' court at Antioch, 



according to Ammianus with instructions to convince Gallus to come to 



Italy, something that Ammianus remarks <a href="constaii.html"><b>



Constantius</b></a> had often urged upon 



Gallus (14.7.9: <i>... Gallum quem crebro acciverat ... </i>.  <i>Cf.</i> <i>Passio 



Artemii</i> 13).  <a href="constaii.html"><b>Constantius</b></a>



 also, according to Ammianus (14.7.9), began to 



reduce the number of troops actually with Gallus (as opposed to troops 



stationed in the east under military commanders).  This reduction fits 



nicely with Zonaras' assertion (13.9) that <a href="constaii.html"><b>



Constantius</b></a> sent Domitianus 



east to check Gallus, whose excesses he feared would precipitate a 



rebellion in Antioch at a time when <a href="constaii.html"><b>



Constantius</b></a>



 still faced a difficult 



situation in the west.  Domitianus snubbed Gallus, plotted his downfall, 



and, when finally he came before Gallus, imperiously commanded him to 



depart for Italy or face an embargo of supplies for the palace at 



Domitianus' order.  Gallus ordered his guardsmen to arrest of 



Domitianus, to whose defense came the quaestor Montius.  In response, 



perhaps (as Ammianus records) urged on by Gallus and, once events were 



underway, by the <i>curator urbis</i> Luscus (not in <i>PLRE</i>), the soldiers 



brutalized and killed both men. </p> 



<p>In Philostorgius' version,<a href="constaii.html"><b>



 Constantius</b></a>, jealous of Gallus' great 



success against Sapor, sent Domitianus to prevent the Caesar's triumphal 



entry into Antioch.  The haughty Domitianus enraged Gallus, who ordered 



Montius to see to Domitianus' death.  When Montius objected that 



Domitianus' execution would exceed the bounds of Gallus' authority, 



<a href="constan.html"><b>Constantina</b></a>



 "dragged down Montius from his judgement-seat with her own 



hands" (3.28) and, with Gallus' consent, both Montius and Domitianus 



were slaughtered.  In what may be nothing more than an anti-Eunomian 



smear, Gregory of Nyssa, also mentioning Theophilus,  complains that 



Aetius' participation in the ruin of Domitianus and Montius went 



unpunished.<a href="#15"><b>[[15]]</b></a> Theophanes <i>AM</i> 



5846, A.D. 353/4, perhaps reflects popular 



perception or propaganda in accusing Gallus of plotting a coup and then 



murdering Domitianus and Montius, both of whom had revealed Gallus' 



plan.</p>  



<h3>The Treason Trials</h3>	



<p>Montius, as he died, had called the names Epigonus and Eusebius, which 



led to the arrests of Epigonus 2 of Cilicia, a philosopher (<i>PLRE</i> I, p. 



280), and Eusebius 10, an orator from Emesa (<i>PLRE</i> I, p. 302).  In a 



cryptic comment (14.7.18), Ammianus observes that the Epigonus and 



Eusebius to whom Montius had referred were actually <i>tribuni fabricarum</i>, 



that is, officers in the arms workshops, "who had promised weapons if a 



revolution should be gotten underway" (<i>promittentes armorum, si novae 



res agitari coepissent</i>).  Was Gallus possibly the target of a faction of 



emperor-makers in the east?  Perhaps so, for Domitianus had recently 



sent his son-in-law Apollinaris 2 (<i>PLRE</i> I, pp. 83-84), who had been in 



charge of the management of the palace at Antioch, to Mesopotamia, where 



there were large concentrations of Roman troops, then in winter 



quarters.  In addition, after the discovery in Tyre of a royal robe 



secretly produced, the rector of the province of Phoenice, none other 



than Apollinaris 1 (<i>PLRE</i> I, p. 83), father of Apollinaris 2, was brought 



to trial together with his son, who had been arrested in Constantinople, 



to which he had fled via Lesser Armenia after learning the fate of 



Domitianus and Montius.  Both father and son were condemned to exile, 



but were, in fact, murdered, presumably on Gallus' orders, once they had 



reached their family villa at Craterae, located very specifically by 



Ammianus twenty-four miles from Antioch (14.9.8).</p>



<p>The trials of the Apollonares provide the context for the recall from 



Nisibis to Antioch by Gallus of the <i>magister equitum</i> Ursicinus 2 (<i>PLRE</i> 



I, pp. 985-986), with whom came Ammianus (14.9.1).  Ammianus represents 



Ursicinus as fearful of Gallus' temperament and in close contact with 



<a href="constaii.html"><b>Constantius</b></a>.



  It was Ursicinus himself who presided over the trials of 



Epigonus and Eusebius.  Both were mercilessly tortured (Ammianus alleges 



on the orders of Gallus and <a href="constan.html"><b>Constantina



</b></a>), Epigonus, though innocent, 



confessing under duress, Eusebius maintaining his innocence to the end.  



Attention turned next to the royal vestment from Tyre.  Among those 



tortured were employees of the dye works and a Christian deacon Maras, 



none of whom confessed to wrongdoing.  A letter from Maras, mentioned by 



Ammianus (14.9.7), may be the correspondence referred  to by Libanius (<i>Or.</i> 



18.24).  Many died, says Ammianus, before attention turned toward the 



Apollinares.</p>



<h3>Gallus' Fall</h3>	



<p>In the spring of 354, while at Valentia, <a href="constaii.html"><b>Constantius</b></a>



 was informed of 



the trials at Antioch by a <i>protector domesticus</i> Herculanus 1 (<i>PLRE</i> I, p. 



420), a son of Hermogenes I (<i>PLRE</i> I, pp. 422-423), a former <i>magister 



equitum</i> in the east and possibly a native of Tyre, where he owned a home 



(Libanius <i>Ep.</i> 828).<a href="#16"><b>[[16]]</b></a>  This, in turn, Ammianus says



 led <a href="constaii.html"><b>Constantius</b></a> to 



attempt to undermine the position of his praetorian prefect Vulcacius 



Rufinus 25 (<i>PLRE</i> I, pp. 782-783, with stemma 26, p. 1145), the 



half-brother of Gallus' mother <a href="sibling.html"><b>Galla</b></a>  Indeed, Volusianus Lampadius 5 



(<i>PLRE</i> I, 978-980) about this time replaced Rufinus and is named by 



Zosimus (2.55.3) as one of the prime instigators of Gallus' arrest and 



execution</p>.



<p>It was only after<a href="constaii.html"><b> Constantius</b></a>



 had concluded a peace with the Alamanni 



and withdrawn to his winter quarters at Milan that affairs came to a 



head.  However, he had already summoned Julian to the west in 353 and 



kept him there for spring of 354 during the campaigns against the 



Alamanni.  Zosimus (2.55) connects Gallus' fate to the desire of court 



sycophants for position and personal gain, indicting by name Dynamius 2 



(<i>PLRE</i> I, p. 275), Picentius (<i>PLRE</i> I, p. 701), and Lampadius (properly C. 



Ceionius Rufius Volusianus 5, <i>PLRE</i> I, pp. 978-980).   Ammianus 



(14.11.1-5) describes secret meetings at with the emperor discussed with 



his confidants how to destroy Gallus.  Flavius Arbitio 2 (<i>PLRE</i> I, pp. 



94-95),<a href="constaii.html"><b> Constantius'</b></a> <i>magister equitum</i>,



 and the <i>praepositus cubiculi</i>, the 



eunuch Eusebius 11 (<i>PLRE</i> I, 302-303) argued against summoning Gallus 



until Ursicinus, whom they charged had designs on the throne, had been 



brought to the west.  They argued that agents of Ursicinus had incited 



Gallus in the hope that his resultant unpopularity would open the way 



to the throne for the sons of the <i>magister equitum</i> himself.  Whether 



this is an accurate picture or not, Constantius called Ursicinus to 



Milan on the pretext of planning for a campaign against the Persians and 



sent to the east as an interim commander with the title <i>dux</i> his vicar 



Prosper (<i>PLRE</i> I, p. 751).  Ammianus comments that he himself accompanied 



Ursicinus to Milan (14.11.5:<i> Mediolanum itineribus properavimus magnis</i>).</p>



<p><a href="constaii.html"><b>Constantius</b></a>



 next prevailed upon Gallus and <a href="constan.html"><b>Constantina</b></a>



 to journey to 



his court.  Libanius (<i>Or.</i> 12.35) cryptically alludes to letters of 



warning sent by Julian to Gallus.  When <a href="constan.html"><b>



Constantina</b></a> died of a fever at 



Caeni Gallicani in Bithynia and Gallus hesitated in Antioch, the 



<i>tribunus scutariorum</i> Scudilo (<i>PLRE</i> I, pp. 810-811) enticed him with news 



that <a href="constaii.html"><b>Constantius</b></a> 



planned to raise him to the rank of Augustus and to 



engage with him in some cooperative operation in the "northern 



provinces" (<i>Arctoae provinciae</i>).  <i>En route</i>, Gallus, apparently in a 



formal adventus, entered Constantinople, staged horse races, and crowned 



a champion charioteer.  This demonstration so worried <a href="constaii.html"><b>



Constantius</b></a> that  



he stripped of troops the towns on Gallus' itinerary and sent a string 



of officials to Gallus, ostensibly on matters of business, but in 



reality to observe the Caesar's actions.<a href="#17"><b>[[17]]</b></a>



   Ammianus (14.11.15) provides 



interesting evidence of the support of the army for Gallus in an 



anecdote which described how some Theban legions, wintering in the area, 



encouraged Gallus to remain in Thrace under their protection.</p>  



<p>Letters from Constantius eventually caused him to continue west to 



Petobio in Noricum, where picked troops led by Barbatio (<i>PLRE</i> I, pp. 



146-147), accompanied by the <i>agens in rebis</i> Apodemius 1 (<i>PLRE</i> I, p. 82), 



surrounded his palace.  Barbatio, whom Ammianus (14.11.24) accuses of 



contriving charges against Gallus before <a href="constaii.html"><b>



Constantius</b></a>, stripped Gallus of 



his imperial robes, assured him that no harm would come to him, and 



transferred him under guard to Pola.  There Eusebius 11 (<i>PLRE</i> I, pp. 



302-303), Pentadius 2 (<i>PLRE</i> I, p. 687), and Mallubaudes (<i>PLRE</i> I, p. 539) 



interrogated him about the treason trials at Antioch.  Ammianus alleges 



that in response Gallus attempted to place on <a href="constan.html"><b>



Constantina</b></a> the 



responsibility for the deaths of those executed.  This, Ammianus 



relates, so enraged <a href="constaii.html"><b>



Constantius</b></a> that he dispatched Serenianus 2 (<i>PLRE</i> I, 



p. 825), who, together with Pentadius and Apodemius, informed Gallus 



that he had been sentenced to death.  Zonaras (13.9.20) records that 



<a href="constaii.html"><b>



Constantius</b></a> changed his mind but  Eusebius prevented news of this 



from reaching the executioners.  Libanius (<i>Or.</i> 18.152), in describing 



the trials at Chalcedon under Julian, states that Eusebius was primarily 



responsible for Gallus' death  The Caesar's hands were bound,  and he was 



summarily beheaded.  Libanius (<i>Or.</i> 12.35 and 18.24), though on what 



actual grounds it is hard to tell, alleges that Gallus was allowed no 



defense, and that his face and head were mutilated.  Gallus had been 



Caesar for four years and at the time of his death was twenty-nine..<a href="#18"><b>[[18]]</b></a>



</p><p>Libanius (<i>Or.</i> 18.26) says that Julian concealed his grief in order not 



to provide <a href="constaii.html"><b>Constantius</b></a>



 with an excuse to execute him.  Julian (<i>Ep. ad 



Ath.</i> 271 A) suggests that Gallus suffered <i>damnatio memoriae</i>. Though his  name 



has indeed been obliterated from an  inscription from Cyprus (Dessau  



<i>ILS</i> 738),  it does appear on other inscriptions..<a href="#19"><b>[[19]]</b></a></p>



<p>Notes</p>					



<p><a name="1"></a>[[1]]Though the date and circumstances of the death of Anonyma 1 are 



unknown, Constantius' second marriage, to Eusebia (<i>PLRE</i> I, p. 300-301) 



in Germany in 353/4, suggests that she may have died shortly before that 



date.  Note Constantius' marriage to Faustina (<i>PLRE</i> I, p. 326) shortly 



after Eusebia's death.</p>

and the jeopardy in which he had put Libanius' uncle Phasganius, on whom 



see Otto Seeck, <i>Die Briefe des Libanius </i>(Reprint of 1906 ed.; 



Hildesheim: Georg Olms, 1966), pp. 234-235.. <i> Cf.</i> Libanius <i>Ep.</i> 64, 



trans. A. F. Norman, <i>Autobiography and Selected Letters</i> II, p. 45-49</p>.	



<p><a name="15"></a>[[15]]<i>Contra Eunomium</i> I, Migne <i>PG</i> 54 (1858), col. 264.  But note Libanius' 



allegation that Constantius repeatedly urged Strategius Musonianus (<i>PLRE</i> 



I, pp. 611-612), praetorian prefect after Domitianus, to moderation in 



his investigation of the incident.</p> 



<p><a name="16"></a>[[16]]Hermogenes had been killed by a mob ca. 342 in Thrace, where 



Constantius had sent him from Antioch to expel the newly elected bishop 



of Constantinople, Paul.</p>  



<p><a name="17"></a>[[17]]Ammianus 14.13.14 names Flavius Leontius 22 (<i>PLRE</i> I, p. 503) 



Lucillianus 3 (<i>PLRE</i> I, pp. 517-518) and Bainobaudes 1 (<i>PLRE</i> I, p. 145).



</p><p><a name="18"></a>[[18]]Philostorgius, who fails to mention the treason trials, links Gallus' 



fall to the fates of Domitianus and Montius.  Upon learning of their 



deaths, Constantius, according to Philostorgius (<i>Hist. eccl.</i> 4.1) 



summoned Gallus and his wife to the west; Constantina died en route in 



Bithynia, while Gallus, together with Theophilus the Indian (not in 



<i>PLRE</i>), eventually reach Noricum.  There Barbatio, who had been sent from 



Milan, attempted on Constantius' orders to strip Gallus of his rank and 



to transport him under arrest to an island in Dalmatia.  When Theophilus 



objected, Constantius had him exiled and Barbatio proceeded to carry out 



his mission.  Constantius was next swayed by the machinations of his 



eunuch Eusebius to order Gallus' execution.  Though Constantius withdrew 



this sentence of death, Eusebius, Philostorgius charges, kept the pardon 



from reaching Gallus' executioners in time.</p>

<h3>NOTE ON TRANSLATIONS</h3>



<p>Translations of some of the literary sources important for Gallus' 



reign exist only in fairly new or in old hard-to-find editions.  Cyril 



Mango, Roger Scott, and Geoffrey Greatrex, <i>The Chronicle of Theophanes 



the Confessor</i> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997), now provide an 



authoritative translation with sparse notes;  Samuel Lieu and Dominic 



Montserrat,  <i>From Constantine to Julian</i> (London and New York: Routledge, 



1996) contains an annotated translation of much of the <i>Passio Artemii</i>.  



For Zonaras, see Michael DiMaio, <i>Zonaras' Account of the Neo-Flavian 



Emperors</i> (Ph.D. diss., University of Missouri, 1977; Ann Arbor: 



University Microfilms, 78-914112).  A. F. Norman's four Loeb volumes of 



<i>Libanius</i> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1969-1992) contain 



much relevant to Gallus.  J. C. Rolfe has a translation and text of the  



<i>Anonymus Valesianus</i> in Vol. III of his Loeb <i>Ammianus</i> (Revised reprint of 



1939 ed.; Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1964).  Edward 



Walford's translation of Photius' <i>Epitome of Philostorgius</i> appears with 



a translation of Sozomenus in the old Bohn series (London: Henry G. 



Bohn, 1855).   Michael H. Dodgeon and Samuel N. C. Lieu, <i>The Roman 



Eastern Frontier and the Persian Wars (AD 226-363)</i>, (London and New 



York: Routledge, 1991), has annotated translations of an impressive 



range of material.  A Select Library of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers 



of the Christian Church contains translations of patristic sources.  One 



important exception is Gregory's <i>Or.</i> 4, translated (unevenly) into 



English by C. W. King, <i>Julian the Emperor</i> (London: George Bell and Sons, 



1888), and into French by Jean Bernardi, <i>Gregoire de Nazianze, Discours 



4-5</i> (Paris: Les éditions du Cerf, 1983).  P. Henry's Bude of <i>Photius 



Bibliotheca</i> (Paris: Société d'édition "Les Belles Lettres," 1959-1991) 



gives a French translation.  Richard Burgess, <i>The Chronicle of Hydatius 



and the Consularia Constantinopolitana</i> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 



1993), supersedes for the <i>Consularia</i> Mommsen's <i>Monumenta Germaniae 



Historica</i> edition, <i>Chronica minora</i> I (Berlin, 1892).</p>
