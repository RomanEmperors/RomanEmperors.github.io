<h4>Abstract </h4>

<span size="-1">The Stoa Consortium aims to promote collaborative scholarship, 
published on line and freely available to other scholars and general 
readers. As a publisher, we must provide the mechanisms for making 
these scholarly works available. As an on-line publisher, we intend to 
provide more than what a good print publisher can provide: electronic 
texts can be explicitly connected as books cannot.

<p>A digital library project generally produces and controls its own 
texts and images. This makes it relatively easy to interconnect those 
resources. A digital publisher, on the other hand, does not produce 
texts itself, and indeed the works published under its auspices need 
not all live on the same computer system. Interconnection in this 
environment requires more explict co-operation by the authors and 
editors of the text: specifically, use of the same markup rules.

</p><p>Markup for us means SGML or XML, conforming to the TEI DTD and 
following Stoa conventions for which features to mark, which values to 
use for certain attributes, and which meta-data to include in the 
document header. We have found that most scholars wishing to publish 
texts with us do not know SGML in general, or this DTD in particular. 
Although they quickly see the benefits of structured markup, they must 
learn the language and the local idiom. The first piece of publishing 
infrastructure, then, is support for markup: documentation, editing
software, and validators.

</p><p>Many authors also want detailed control over the appearance of 
their work. They expect, sometimes unconsciously, that the technology 
of the Web as it exists today is and will be the final, best way to 
publish their work. While we prefer to take a longer-term, more 
general view, we recognize that on-line publication today does in fact 
mean the Web. The second piece of infrastructure is display formatting, 
whether for the Web, for printing, or for some future delivery medium.

</p><p>The third piece of infrastructure is interconnection, which is what 
makes on-line publication fundamentally different from print. 
Interconnection means that references to other objects, outside the 
text, can automatically be hyperlinked to those objects. The typical 
digital library model is that objects within the library can be 
hyperlinked to each other, while objects outside are not linked. Since 
the digital publishing house does not "contain" its texts, on the 
other hand, there is no reason for it to restrict these reference 
connections to only works it has published itself. The Stoa has 
developed a reference database that allows any work published by the 
Stoa to refer to any resource elsewhere on the Internet. Hyperlinks 
are generated when the text is displayed, which means they are always 
as current as the content of the database.

</p></span><p><span size="-1">The Stoa's tool set will be made available as open-source software, 
and we hope that other on-line publishers and digital libraries may 
wish to share reference information. </span>

</p><h4>Introduction </h4>

<p>The Stoa Consortium was founded in 1998 to promote collaborative 
scholarship in the humanities, particularly the classics. The Stoa 
also intends to promote technical standards, for text encoding as well 
as for image capture, geographic data recording, and other processes. 
The best way to promote a standard is to provide an application that 
uses it. For the text encoding standards the Stoa wishes to use, that 
application is the Perseus text-processing system. The Perseus system 
works with texts encoded in SGML or XML (the differences between SGML
and XML are not significant for the present paper), using the DTD of 
the Text Encoding Initiative. Those texts can be presented on the Web, 
converted to PDF, searched, interlinked, and indexed, based on 
structural and semantic information in the markup.

</p><p>The Perseus text system is an infrastructure, but it requires 
additional support, both technical and social. Technical support 
includes the ancillary applications that facilitate structured markup
- editors, syntax validators, documentation. It also 
includes applications relevant to the other parts of the system, for 
example support for image captioning and curatorial cataloguing, but 
those applications are outside the focus of the present paper.

</p><p>Social support involves convincing the community that structured 
markup is desirable and feasible. Many potential Stoa collaborators 
are concerned that structured markup may be difficult to learn; they 
would rather use a familiar tool, for example a word processor like 
Microsoft Word or a typesetting language like TeX. Others note that 
works published on the Web as it exists today must be converted into 
HTML, and wonder why it's necessary to write in a different language, 
then convert the text; they'd rather write in HTML in the first place. 
Still other scholars expect, not unreasonably, that the technical 
details are the publisher's problem; just as they do not typeset their 
own books and articles for publication in print, they do not see why 
they are expected to use an apparently complex markup scheme for 
electronic publication. While all these objections are sensible enough, 
they do not take into account key reasons for using structured markup. 
I will discuss this further in section two. 

</p><p>The Perseus text system includes a variety of ways to change the 
display of a text, some under the reader's control and some controlled 
by the author or editor. Stoa collaborators who expect detailed 
control over the presentation of their work can have it, up to the 
limits imposed by HTML of course. In the Perseus Digital Library, each 
collection has its own logo and color scheme, but most of them have a 
common appearance, indicating that they are all part of a single 
digital library. This is a choice made by the Perseus designers, not 
an intrinsic feature of the software system, and it is in fact 
straightforward to change the appearance of a collection of texts or 
even of an individual document. I will go into more details in section 
three.

</p><p>The most important feature of the Perseus system is the array of 
sophisticated features it provides for interconnecting texts. 
Interconnection - hyperlinking - is what makes 
on-line publication fundamentally different from print. Originally, I 
expected to implement tools for the Stoa, and last year produced a 
rudimentary linking system for certain kinds of references. As I 
thought about the tools we were producing for the Perseus Digital 
Library, however, I realized it was silly to re-implement something 
similar, when what I really wanted for the Stoa was the full power of 
the Perseus toolset. The various automatically generated hypertexts, 
implicit "information-push" searches, and dynamically generated 
reversible citations make this digital library toolset one of the 
richest environments currently available for on-line publication. The 
Stoa has therefore adopted the Perseus toolset. This has also prompted 
the Perseus team to generalize the toolset and make it more widely 
available. Perseus has another collaborating project that hopes to 
install and use this application, and we expect that in the next year 
or so we will be able to make the text processing system available to 
other projects as open source software.

</p><p>In what follows, I will discuss the Stoa's technical and social 
support for structured markup; how Stoa projects might exploit the 
display mechanisms of the Perseus text system; and how structured 
markup facilitates interconnections among texts, not just within a 
single collection but in a web of co-operating systems. 

</p><h4>Markup Support </h4>

<p>Technical support for structured markup is easy: the basic tools 
are widely available. Any number of editors, ranging from highly 
specialized SGML systems to general-purpose, configurable utilities, 
and at prices ranging from free to tens of thousands of dollars, make 
it possible to edit structured text. None of these editors is more 
difficult to learn than a modern word processor. 

</p><p>It is also important to be able to verify the correctness of SGML 
markup, and for this one uses a validator. Some editors have built-in 
validation capabilities, and some can even ensure that the text being 
edited is never invalid. It's also possible to use a separate 
validation program. A compromise between integral and separate 
validation is an editor that can call upon the validation program when 
you ask it to. However one invokes it, the SGML validator identifies 
any syntactic problems with the markup of the text, from mis-spelled 
tags to missing structural levels. Most SGML validators cannot verify 
the semantics of the markup, however. For example, they cannot check 
whether text marked as prose is really verse, or whether a quote 
marked as Latin is really French. Moreover, they usually cannot check 
whether syntactically valid SGML conforms to the project's guidelines. 
For example, it is valid according to the TEI DTD to mark a phrase as 
a quotation, without indicating a language. When the quotation is in a
different language from the surrounding text, the Stoa's standards 
require that the language be indicated. SGML validators cannot verify 
this because all they know is that the DTD allows quote elements with 
or without the "lang" attribute.

</p><p>Intermediate between technical support and what I'm calling social 
support is documentation. Good software should always have good 
documentation, and good standards necessarily have good documentation. 
The documentation for the TEI DTD is excellent, if a bit daunting in 
its magnitude. The documentation for the DTD itself, however, is not 
enough: it's also necessary to explain the standards of the particular 
project, and the rules imposed by the software that will process the 
SGML documents. I have written an explanation of the Stoa's particular 
guidelines, in tutorial form; it's available on the Stoa's web server, 
where it has been accessed over 6,700 times in the past year. 
Technical information about the implementation of the text system is 
available in a series of research articles by members of the Perseus 
technical staff. Additional documentation is always desirable, 
however. In this case, particular desiderata include a detailed 
listing of the conventions for attribute values, the choices of 
features to be tagged, and other project-specific and 
application-specific guidelines beyond the use of the TEI, as well as
detailed documentation of the major data structures and processing 
flow in the Perseus text system.

</p><p>But social support extends beyond documentation. While it's 
straightforward to explain how to create SGML documents, it is also 
important to explain why. As I outlined above, there are several 
different reasons why Stoa collaborators do not immediately embrace 
structured markup: its presumed difficulty, the apparent silliness of 
writing in one language only to convert at once to another, and the 
principle that it should be the publisher's responsibility to do the
publishing of a text. I will consider each of these in turn.

</p><p>Structured markup is not in itself difficult, nor is it a form of 
computer programming. Whenever we begin a new scholarly article by 
sketching out a title, an abstract, and section headings, we are 
making a structured text. When we format the abstract in a smaller 
type face from the rest of the text, or make the section headings 
larger and bold, we are applying a markup that reflects the structure. 
All that SGML does is provide a formalism for expressing this kind of 
structure in a way that any reader or any software can exploit. When 
we read a text, if we see occasional short lines of larger, boldface 
letters, perhaps starting with a number, we recognize these lines as
section headings. If we're skimming the text quickly, perhaps the 
section headings are the only things we read. We know these lines are 
section headings because we have a great deal of experience reading 
scholarly articles, and we know how they are ordinarily laid out. We 
can recognize the section headings even if the article is written in 
a language we can't read.

</p><p>With SGML markup, the section headings are recognizable because 
they are labelled. Whereas in ordinary typographical "markup" the 
features are recognizable by their appearance, and interpretable in 
the light of human experience, in structured markup the features are 
recognizable and interpretable by their names: no human experience is 
required. In other words, a computer program can find the section 
headings, for example to produce a table of contents.

</p><p>In the case of our section headings, it's pretty easy to recognize 
them unambiguously: nothing else in the text is likely to be a short 
line of larger, boldface letters. Consider a harder case, a word or 
phrase in italics. The human reader easily recognizes whether an 
italicized phrase is a title, a foreign phrase, a reported thought, or 
an emphasized phrase; these are conventional uses of italics, and 
context usually makes clear which is which. A program scanning a file, 
however, has no context, because it cannot actually read the text. 
This is generally true of text processors. Programs that can parse 
natural language, or that have access to dictionaries for the main
language of the text or of foreign languages that might appear in it, 
can often disambiguate italics as humans do. If you want to list the 
works cited in the article, or make a glossary of the foreign phrases, 
you'll need to inspect all the italicized phrases and decide why each 
one is in italics. With SGML markup, instead of italicizing several 
different kinds of phrases for several different reasons, we mark each 
one with what it is: a title, a phrase in a particular language (which 
we specify), a reported thought, an emphasized phrase, or whatever 
else it might be. Display processing may indeed render all of these 
as italics, but the additional information is available to be 
exploited by indexing tools, automatic dictionary lookups, and so on.

</p><p>Structured markup, then, allows authors to do the same kinds of 
things we do with our word processors, but also allows us to store 
more and clearer information.

</p><p>But if we are simply going to turn those titles, foreign words, 
and so on back into italics, why did we bother marking them up? This 
is the second objection: why write SGML if we are only displaying 
HTML?

</p><p>If all you are going to do with your SGML documents is convert them 
to HTML, then this objection is correct: you have no need of SGML. The 
point of a digital library system, however, is that you can do much 
more with structured documents. Every important feature of the Perseus
text processing system is based on the fact that the documents are 
encoded in SGML, not HTML; marked for their structure, not their 
appearance. That they are displayed on the Web in HTML form is an 
ephemeral fact, not an intrinsic fact about the texts; the same SGML 
files can be converted to other formats for other purposes. As new 
display technologies are developed, it will be possible to use them to 
render SGML files, based on the semantic information in their markup, 
without changing the SGML files at all. HTML files, on the other hand, 
will not necessarily be automatically compatible with any other format 
at all. The information extraction and visualization tools of the 
Perseus text system also exploit the structural and semantic 
information of the SGML files.

</p><p>The third objection to SGML raised by some Stoa collaborators is 
that markup should be the publisher's problem, just as it is in print. 
Print publishers accept text from authors, then convert it to whatever 
form their in-house system requires. Even if the publisher chooses to 
use SGML, the author might submit the text on paper, to be re-keyed by 
the publisher's staff. 

</p><p>This is, indeed, how many publishers do business now, but not all. 
In fact, some publishers of printed books and journals ask for 
submissions in SGML, according to a DTD they specify. This is a great 
advantage for them, because the texts come from their authors already 
in the correct form for further processing. It is also an advantage 
for the authors, because they can unambiguously specify the semantics 
of their text. Good SGML markup makes clear which sections are major 
and which are sub-sections or sub-sub-sections or sub-sub-sub-sections;
this is difficult to do with typography, and error-prone with outline 
numbering. SGML markup can also identify words in other languages, to 
facilitate spell-checking; can give regularized forms for words in 
non-standard dialects, e.g., Attic equivalents for the comic Spartan 
dialect; or can ensure that footnotes sit next to the text they 
comment on, rather than on some other page. An author who marks up a 
manuscript with SGML is indicating exactly what each element of the
text means, not just what it might look like. In asking for 
submissions in SGML form, the Stoa is being progressive. 

</p><h4>Display</h4>

<p>Regular users of the Perseus Digital Library are accustomed to the 
look of its texts. In most of the Perseus collections, text is 
displayed in a single window, with global tools in a top bar and 
collection-specific tools in a side bar. The background color of 
these tool bars identifies the collection. All Perseus text pages look 
much alike.

</p><p>The designers of the Perseus Digital Library web site chose to 
retain a common style throughout, but the appearance of the pages is 
highly configurable. In fact, one of the collections, the Tufts 
University History collection, has a distinctly different appearance 
and somewhat different behavior. 

</p><p>The Perseus text processing system allows specification of a 
display template for a collection, to be used by all the texts in the 
collection; an individual text may also have an overriding template
of its own. The templates for HTML display are written in HTML, 
augmented with calls to processing functions that can fetch text or 
meta-data. It is also possible to override portions of the SGML 
conversion rules for particular elements, and this too may be done at 
the level of the collection or of the individual document. 

</p><h4>Interconnection </h4>

<p>The point of using a digital library system is to interconnect the 
objects in the library. In a print library, books are implicitly 
connected: when a book about Sophocles refers to Aeschylus, the author 
indicates the play and line number, and the reader is free to pull out 
a text of the older playwright and read the passage. In a 
well-implemented digital library, those connections will be explicit. 
When the on-line edition of the Sophocles book refers to Aeschylus, 
there will be a live link at the point of the citation, which the 
reader can follow to find the passage in Aeschylus. In the Perseus 
Digital Library, moreover, this link goes both ways. Someone reading 
Aeschylus will see a link back to the book about Sophocles which 
refers to the passage. 

</p><p>At present, these interconnections operate only within a single 
digital library. The Perseus group expects to make interconnections 
available among co-operating libraries, forming a federation. This 
will involve common meta-data rules and naming standards, so that for 
example "Homer" is always identified in the same way. Each library in 
the federated group must make its catalog available to the others. 
Suppose a reader in one of the libraries requests a section of a book
about Sophocles. The digital library system will display the desired 
section, and will link the references to Sophocles' plays to copies 
of those texts available at another co-operating library, for example 
at Perseus. The Perseus group expects to work on implementing such a
system after the text processing system is in use at the Stoa.

</p><p>Citations are not the only kind of interconnections among texts, or 
between texts and other objects. The Perseus text processing system 
can recognize place names, dates, and keywords in texts and link them 
automatically to appropriate tools, based on the contents of the 
digital library. These implicit searches will work in any digital 
library that uses the Perseus text-processing system. As with 
citations, however, it is also quite desirable to make these searches
work throughout a group of co-operating libraries; this is a future 
direction. 

</p><h4>Conclusions </h4>

<p>The Perseus digital library system is a powerful tool for on-line 
publishing of structured text. The Stoa will be installing this 
system for its own texts, and will ultimately join in a federated 
digital library group with the Perseus Digital Library. To make the 
Perseus system work for Stoa collaborators, those collaborators will 
need to embrace structured markup.
