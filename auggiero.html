<h3>BACKGROUND AND ACCESSION</h3>





<p>By the year 475, the western Roman empire was on its last legs.  Its geographical

holdings had shrunk to Italy and a toehold in southern Gaul.  The reigning western

emperor, <a href="nepos.html"><b>Julius Nepos</b></a> 

(474-475) had been appointed by the eastern emperors <a href="leo1.html"><b>Leo</b></a> (457-474) and <a href="zeno.html"><b>Zeno</b></a> (474-491), but 

had little tangible support either in the east or the west.  In

475, <a href="nepos.html"><b>Nepos</b></a>

 replaced the Patrician and Master of Soldiers in the west, the Gaul Ecdicius,

with Orestes, whose primary claim to fame had been service as the <em>notarius</em> (secretary) of

Attila the Hun.  Orestes responded by marching on Ravenna.  The sixth-century Gothic

historian Jordanes tells the tale:</p>



<p>	"This Orestes, having taken charge of the army and having departed from

Rome against the enemies, arrived at Ravenna, and remaining there he

made his son Augustulus emperor.  When he learned this, Nepos fled to

Dalmatia" ("<em>qui Orestes suscepto exercitu et contra hostes egrediens a

Roma Ravenna pervenit ibique remoratus Augustulum filimum suum

imperatorem efficit.  quo conperto Nepus fugit Dalmatias...": Jordanes,

Getica</em> 241). </p>





<p>The <em>Anonymous Valesianus</em> indicates that <a href="nepos.html"><b>Nepos</b></a>

 arrived at Ravenna with Orestes in hot

pursuit: "Soon Nepos arrived at Ravenna, pursued by the Patrician Orestes and his army. 

Fearing the arrival of Orestes, Nepos boarded a ship and fled to Salona" ("<em>mox veniens

Ravennam, quem persequens Orestes patricius cum exercitu, metuens Nepos adventum

Orestis, ascendens navem fugam petit ad Salonam</em>": 7.36 <em>s.a</em>.474).  The <em>Auctuarii

Hauniensis ordo prior</em> provides some additional insights:</p>





<p>"While Nepos was in the city, the Patrician Orestes was sent against him

with the main force of the army.  But because Nepos dared not undertake

the business of resisting in such desperate conditions, he fled to Dalmatia in

his ships.  When Nepos had fled Italy and departed from the city, Orestes assumed

the primacy and all the authority for himself and made his son Augustulus

emperor at Ravenna" (<em>"Nepote apud urbem residente Orestes patricius cum

robore exercitus contra eum mittitur.  sed cum desperatae rei negotium

resistendo sumere non auderet, ad Dalmatias navigiis fugit.  cum Nepos

fugiens Italiam ac urbem reliquisset, Orestes primatum omnemque sibi

vindicans dignitatem Augustulum filium suum apud Ravennam positum

imperatorem facit, ipse vero omnem curam externorum praesidiorum

gerit</em>": <em>s.a</em>.475; cf. <em>Auctarii Hauniensis ordo posterior</em>: "<em>Nepos cum ab

Oreste patricio cum exercitu persequeretur, fugiens ad Dalmatias usque

navigavit</em>": <em>s.a</em>.475).</p>





<p> Other, briefer, sources provide a little clarification.  The <em>Fasti vindobonenses priores</em>,

for example, confirm that <a href="nepos.html"><b>Nepos</b></a>

 took flight from Ravenna after the arrival of Orestes: "In

this year, on 28 August, the Patrician Orestes entered Ravenna with his army and the

emperor Nepos fled to Dalmatia" ("<em>his cons. introivit Ravennam patricius Orestes cum

exercitu et fugavit imp. Nepos ad Dalmatias V kl. Septemb.</em>": no.615. <em>s.a</em>.475).  Jordanes

says simply, "In the western empire, Orestes put the emperor Nepos to flight and

established his own son Augustulus on the throne" ("<em>parte vero Hesperia Nepotem

imperatorem Orestes fugatum Augustulum suum filium in imperium conlocavit</em>":

Jordanes, <em>Romana</em>  344); and Count Marcellinus likewise recalled, "As soon as Nepos

had been put to flight Orestes set his son Augustulus on the throne" ("<em>Nepote Orestes

protinus effugato Augustulum filium suum in imperium conlocavit</em>": <em>Chron</em>. <em>s.a</em>.475). </p>





<p>Orestes then seems to have temporized for over two months, perhaps waiting for some

response from the east.  Finally, on 31 October 475, Orestes named his young son

Romulus, perhaps fourteen years of age, as western Roman emperor.  Given 

that <a href="nepos.html"><b>Nepos</b></a>,

who had been nominated by the eastern emperor <a href="leo1.html"><b>Leo</b></a> (457-474), still reigned, albeit in

exile, there was no question of Romulus ever receiving recognition from the east.  The

report by the chronicler Victor of Tonnena that Orestes' son was named Herculanus, and

made an abortive attempt to seize power after the death of 

<a href="anthemiu.html"><b>Anthemius</b></a>, seems to be an

erroneous reference to Romulus.</p>







<h3>REIGN</h3>





<p>The youngster took the title "Augustus" as his name, but became commonly known as

Augustulus, "the little Augustus": in the words of the <em>Anonymous Valesianus</em>,

"Augustulus, who prior to ruling had been called Romulus by his parents, was made emperor by his father, 

the Patrician Orestes."  Orestes, of course, intended to keep the

real power in his own hands, as noted by an anonymous Italian chronicler: "Orestes,

appropriating the primacy and every power to himself, made his son Augustulus emperor

at Ravenna; he himself undertook all the supervision of external affairs."</p>





<p>The most serious problem that the new administration faced was how to manage the

diverse barbarian troops putatively under his command.  One means of doing so was to

pay them.  Gold <em>solidi</em> of Romulus were issued at Rome, Milan, and probably Ravenna. 

And one problem that the die-cutters had was in trying to fit the entire name "Romulus

Augustus" onto a single coin.  A token number of <em>solidi</em> also was issued at Arles, attesting

to the last tenuous hold that the empire had in Gaul.  A few silver coins were issued at

Ravenna, but no bronze coins of Romulus are known.</p>





<p>Problems with the soldiers escalated in 476, when troops including Heruls, Scirians,

and Torcilingi made demands for land grants that were refused by Orestes.  The soldiers

then turned to Odovacar, a barbarian chieftain from a Hunnish and Scirian background. 

He promised to grant their requests if they made him king.  They did so on 23 August,

and then advanced against Orestes.</p>





<h3>DEPOSITION</h3>





<p> On 28 August 476, Orestes was captured and killed by Odovacar near Piacenza -- the

site of the defeat of the emperor Avitus in 456.  Odovacar then occupied Ravenna, where

on either 31 August or 4 September he killed Orestes' brother Paulus.  As for young

Romulus, the <em>Anonymous Valesianus</em> (8.38) reports, "Entering Ravenna, Odovacar

deposed Augustulus from the rule, and taking pity on his youth he granted him his life,

and because he was comely he even granted to him an income of six thousand <em>solidi</em> and

sent him to Campania to live freely with his relatives."  The chronicler Count Marcellinus

painted a rather less rosy picture of Romulus' fate: "Odovacar, king of the Goths,

occupied Rome.  Odovacar immediately killed Orestes.  Odovacar condemned

Augustulus, the son of Orestes, to exile in the castle of Lucullus in Campania" ("Odoacar

rex Gothorum Romam obtinuit.  Orestem Odoacer ilico trucidavit.  Augustulum filium

Orestis Odoacer in Lucullano Campaniae castello exilii poena damnavit": s.a.476).  And

Jordanes similarly related,</p>





<p>"After Augustulus had been established as emperor at Ravenna by his father

Orestes, not long afterward Odovacer, king of the Torcilingi, who had with

him the Scirians, Heruls, and auxiliaries from diverse peoples, occupied

Italy and, after killing Orestes, deposed his son Augustulus from the rule

and condemned him to exile in the Lucullan castle in Campania"

("<em>Augustulo vero a patre Oreste in Ravenna imperatore ordinato non

multum post Odoacer Torcilingorum rex habens secum Sciros, Herulos

diversarumque gentium auxiliarios Italiam occupavit et Orestem interfectum Augustulum filium eius de regno pulsum in Lucullano Campaniae

castello exilii poena damnavit</em>": <em>Getica</em> 242).</p>





<p>This <em>castellum</em> has sometimes been identified as the estate of the late-Roman Republican

general Lucullus.</p>





<p>The Byzantine historian Malchus, moreover, suggests that Romulus was required to

perform one final official act before going into retirement: the dispatching of a "letter of

resignation" to the eastern emperor <a href="zeno.html"><b>Zeno</b></a> returning the imperial regalia and saying that the

empire now needed but a single emperor, in Constantinople.</p>





<p>	"When Augustus, the son of Orestes, heard that Zeno, having expelled

Basiliscus, had again gained the kingship of the east, he caused the Senate

to send an embassy to tell Zeno that they had no need of a separate empire

but that a single common emperor would be sufficient for both territories,

and, moreover, that Odovacar had been chosen by them as a suitable man to

safeguard their affairs, since he had political understanding along with

military skill; they asked Zeno to award Odovacar the patrician honor and

grant him the government of the Italies.  The men from the Senate in Rome

reached Byzantium carrying these messages.  On the same day messengers

from Nepos also came to congratulate Zeno on the recent events concerning

this restoration, and at the same time to ask him zealously to help Nepos, a

man who had suffered equal misfortunes, in the recovery of his empire. 

They asked that he grant money and an army for this purpose and that he

co-operate in his restoration in any other ways that might be necessary. 

Nepos had sent the men to say these things.  Zeno gave the following

answer to those arrivals and to the men from the Senate: the western

Romans had received two men from the eastern Empire and had driven one

out, Nepos, and killed the other, Anthemius.  Now, he said, they knew what

ought to be done.  While their emperor was still alive, they should hold no

other thought than to receive him back on his return.  To the barbarians he

replied that it would be well if Odovacar were to receive the patrician rank

from the emperor Nepos and that he himself would grant it unless Nepos

granted it first.  He commended him in that he had displayed this initial

instance of guarding good order, suitable to the Romans, and trusted for this

reason that, if he truly wished to act with justice, he would quickly receive

back the emperor [sc. Nepos] who had given him his positon of honor.  He

sent a royal epistle about what he desired to Odovacar and in this letter

named him a patrician.  Zeno gave this help to Nepos, pitying his sufferings

because of his own, and holding to the principle that the common lot of

fortune is to grieve with the unfortunate.  At the same time Verina also

joined in urging this, giving a helping hand to the wife of Nepos, her

relative" (<em>fr</em>. 10: Gordon trans., pp.127-128)</p>





<p><a href="nepos.html"><b>Nepos</b></a>,

 of course, never was able to reoccupy Italy, which remained in the hands of

Odovacar.  Cassiodorus stated, "In this year, Orestes and his brother Paulus were killed

by Odovacar, and Odovacar assumed the title of King, although he made use of neither

the purple nor the imperial regalia" ("<em>His conss. ab Odovacre Orestes et frater eius

Paulus extincti sunt nomenque regis Odovacar adsumpsit, cum tamen nec purpura nec

regalibus uteretur insignibus</em>": no.1303).</p>



<p>Romulus had lost his throne after just over ten months of rule -- his deposition would

have occurred on or soon after 4 September 476.  One cannot explain the curious report

in the <em>Anonymus Valesianus</em> that Augustulus ruled not one but ten years: "<em>Augustulus

imperavit annos X</em>" (7.36).   His fate after his settlement in Campania is unknown, 

although it has been suggested that he might be the Romulus to whom the Ostrogothic king

Theodoric wrote ca. 507/511 concerning a bequest made to a certain Romulus and his

mother.</p>





<h3>EPILOGUE</h3>





<p>After Romulus' fall, the last scanty imperial possessions in southern Gaul were

occupied by the Visigoths: under the year 477, the <em>Gallic Chronicle of 511</em> reported,

"Arles was captured by Euric, along with Marseilles and the other fortified places"

("<em>Arelate capta est ab Eurico cum Massilia et ceteris castellis</em>": no.657).  Curiously,

however, the Danubian provinces of Raetia and Noricum seem still to have retained a

loose connection to Italy (the <em>Life of St. Severinus of Noricum</em> reports that border militia

in Noricum continuing to have expectations of being paid from Italy), not, hoever,

because of any Italian authority, but merely because of administrative inertia, and the lack

of any barbarian people sufficiently powerful, or interested, to occupy this region.</p>





<p>Romulus commonly has been considered to be the last emperor of the western empire;

with names like "Romulus" and "Augustus", it would have been difficult indeed to resist

doing so.  This tradition began as early as the early sixth century, when Count

Marcellinus lamented,</p>





<p>	"The western Empire of the Roman people, which first began in the seven

hundred and ninth year after the founding of the City with Octavian

Augustus, the first of the emperors, perished with this Augustulus, in the

five-hundred and twenty-second year of the reign of Augustus' successor

emperors.  From this point on Gothic kings held power in Rome" ("<em>Hesperium Romanae gentis imperium, quod septingentesimo nono urbis conditae

anno primus Augustorum Octavianus Augustus tenere coepit, cum hoc

Augustulo periit, anno decessorum regni imperatorum quingentesimo

vigesimo secundo, Gothorum dehinc regibus Roman tenentibus</em>": <i>s.a</i>.476).</p>





<p>Both the "seven hundred and ninth year after the founding of the City," counting from

753 BC, and, counting backward from 476 AD, "five-hundred and twenty-second year

of the reign of Augustus' successors", work out to 45 BC, the date that Marcellinus

seems to have assumed the Roman Empire began.  Perhaps Caesar's victory at Munda or

his assumption of the perpetual dictatorship was meant. or, if not this, then perhaps the

inception of the Second Triumvirate in 43 BC, or the death of Julius Caesar in 44 BC.</p>





<p> Romulus was indeed the last, and perhaps even the least significant, of the "shadow" or

"puppet" emperors of the west.  But otherwise he was a mere usurper, and an undistinguished one at that.  

The legitimate western emperor <a href="nepos.html"><b>Nepos</b></a> not only continued to rule,

albeit in Dalmatia, but even had coins issued in his name in Odovacar's Italy.  Until his

death in 480, <a href="nepos.html"><b>Nepos</b></a>

 continued to have hopes of recovering his throne, and more rightly

deserves the title "last western Roman emperor."</p>





<p>The sixth-century Byzantine historian Procopius pronounced an apt epitaph on

Augustulus and the other shadow emperors when he noted, confusing  

<a href="nepos.html"><b>Nepos</b></a> with

<a href="olybrius.html"><b>Olybrius</b></a>,</p>





<p>	"And another emperor, Nepos, upon taking over the empire and living to

enjoy it only a few days, died of disease, and Glycerius after him entered

into this office and suffered a similar fate.  And after him Augustus

assumed the imperial power.  There were, moreover, still other emperors in

the west before this time, bht although I know their names well, I shall

make no mention of them whatsoever.  For it so fell out that they lived only

a short time after attaining the office, and as a result of this accomplished

nothing worthy of mention..." (<em>Bellum Vandalicum</em> 7.15-17: Dewing trans.,

p.69)</p>

<h3>Romulus' early life and reign</h3>



        <p>Romulus, commonly called the diminutive "Augustulus" because of



his youth, was named emperor by his father, Orestes, after the latter 



had revolted against <a href="nepos.html"><b>Julius Nepos.</b></a>  Crowned in October of 475, possibly 



at the age of ten, he reigned as a figurehead for ten months in Ravenna 



while his father actually ran the remains of the western empire in Italy 



as military commander-in-chief (<i>magister militum</i>).  In mid-476, Odovacer--



a "barbarian" officer of undetermined ethnicity--led a revolt against 



Orestes for failing to provide lands for Germanic troops in Roman employ 



(or perhaps income from those lands).  Orestes was quickly defeated 



and executed in August of that year.  </p>







        <p>Romulus was spared because of his age and was sent to live in



exile at the <i>castellum Lucullanum</i> near Naples.  Lucullanum had been an 



imperial estate originally built by the Roman Republican statesman, 



Lucius Licinius Lucullus (consul 74 BC), and had served as the retirement 



villa for the emperor <a href="tiberiu.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>.  With Romulus went various relatives and 



a sizable retinue.  Odovacer granted him an annual stipend of 6,000 <i>solidi,</i> 



the income of a wealthy senator, and sent the imperial regalia to the 



emperor <a href="zeno.html"><b>Zeno</b></a> in Constantinople.  Odovacer subsequently swore allegiance to 



the eastern emperor and ruled as king in Italy without an imperial successor.  



Most scholars consider Romulus Augustulus' forced abdication the end of the 



western Roman Empire as a political entity.



</p>



<h3>Possible post-abdication activities</h3>



        <p>As a private citizen, Romulus appears to have founded an important



monastery at Lucullanum centered around the remains of St. Severinus, 



sometime in the 480's or early 490's.  Barbaria, a noblewoman who was



probably his mother, also played a crucial role in establishing the 



religious house.  In 493 and again in 507 (or 511), Romulus had to 



renegotiate his financial arrangements with the government of king 



Theodoric:  Odovacer after all had promised the stipend, not the Ostrogothic 



king.  He is surely dead by the time of the emperor Justinian's invasion 



of Italy in the mid-530's.  The historian Procopius--who considered Romulus 



the last legitimate ruler of the west--does not mention the boy-emperor 



during his account of the campaign.  Romulus' monastery, however, gained



considerable prominence by the pontificate of Gregory I and survived into 



the tenth century (Severinus' remains still rest in Naples today).  </p>











      <p>  Nothing of his personal character is known nor what policies, if



any, he pursued.  There are no laws, no significant inscriptions and few 



coins to supplement the meager narrative record of Romulus Augustulus' 



brief stewardship of the imperial throne.  Yet this shadowy and 



inconsequential figure holds the dubious distinction of being Rome's last 



 western emperor.</p>
