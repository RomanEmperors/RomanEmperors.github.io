<p><b>Introduction and Sources</b></p></center>

<center><div>"But as Alexander was a modest and dutiful youth, of only seventeen
years of age, the reins of government were in the hands of two women, of
his mother Mamaea, and of Maesa, his grandmother. After the death of the
latter, who survived but a short time the elevation of Alexander, Mamaea
remained the sole regent of her son and of the empire." (Gibbon,
<i>Decline
and Fall</i>, chap. 6:&nbsp;<i> Modern Library Edition</i>, p. 130)
<p>"As the imperial system developed, it disclosed its various
<i>arcana</i>
one by one. How much does the personality of the ruler matter? Less and
less, it should seem. Be he boy, buffoon, or philosopher, his conduct may
not have much effect on the administration. Habit and routine took over,
with groups and grades of bureaucrats at hand to fill the posts." (Syme,
<i>Emperors
and Biography</i>, 146)</p></div></center>

<p>The passages quoted above emphasize two important aspects of the principate
of Severus Alexander (or Alexander Severus), his youth and the influence
of women during his reign. The significance of the latter invites brief
discourse about the four women known as the "Severan Julias," whose origin
was Syria. Julia Domna became the second wife of <b><a href="sepsev.html">Septimius
Severus</a></b> and bore him two sons, the later emperors <b><a href="caracala.html">Caracalla</a></b>
and <b><a href="geta.html">Geta</a></b>. Her role in the administration
of her husband was significant, which her expansive titulature, "mother
of the camp and the senate and the country," reflected. Her sister, Julia
Maesa, had two daughters, each of whom produced a son who was to become
emperor. Julia Soaemias was the mother of <b><a href="elagabal.html">Elagabalus,</a></b>
and shared his fate when he was assassinated. Julia Mamaea bore Alexander,
who succeeded his cousin; he was very young and hence much under the control
of grandmother and mother. For the first time in its imperial history,
the empire of Rome was <i>de facto</i>, though not <i>de iure</i>, governed
by women.
</p><p>The literary sources, while numerous, are limited in value. Chief among
them, at least in scope, is the biography in the <i>Historia Augusta</i>,
much the longest of all the lives in this peculiar collection. Though purporting
to be the work of six authors in the early fourth century, it is now generally
considered to have been produced by one author writing in the last years
of this century. Spacious in its treatment of the emperor and extremely
favorable to him on the whole, it has little historical merit, seeming
rather an extended work of fiction. It must be used with the utmost caution.
</p><p>Herodian, whose history covered the period 180-238, was a contemporary
of Severus Alexander, and his coverage of the latter's reign is extensive.
Another contemporary, Dio Cassius, who was consul in 229 and whose judgments
would have been most valuable, is unfortunately useless here, since his
history survives only in abbreviated form and covers barely a page of printed
text for the whole reign (Book 80). Aurelius Victor, Eutropius, the <i>Epitome
de Caesaribus</i>, and other Latin sources are extremely brief, informing
us of only the occasional anecdote. Christian writers make minimal contribution;
legal texts offer much instruction, particularly those dealing with or
stemming from Ulpian; coins, inscriptions, papyri, and archaeology help
fill the gaps left by the literary sources.
</p><center>
<p><b>Early Life and Education</b></p></center>

<p>The future emperor (<i>PIR<sup>2</sup></i> A 1610) was born in Arca
Caesarea in Phoenicia on October 1, 208 although some sources put the date
three years earlier (as Gibbon assumed, see above), the son of Gessius
Marcianus (<i>PIR</i><sup>2</sup> G 171), whose career advanced in the
equestrian <i>cursus</i>, and of Julia Mamaea (<i>PIR</i><sup>2</sup> I
649), niece of the then empress, Julia Domna, wife of<b><a href="sepsev.html">
Septimius Severus</a></b>. He was raised quietly and well educated, at
the instance of his mother.<b><a href="#N_1_">[[1]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
He came into the public eye only in 218, when, after <b><a href="macrinus.html">Macrinus'</a></b>
murder of <b><a href="caracala.html">Caracalla</a></b> and accession to
the purple, he and his mother were declared <i>hostes publici</i>. In June
of that year, <b><a href="elagabal.html">Elagabalus</a></b> defeated <b><a href="macrinus.html">Macrinus</a></b>
and succeeded him as emperor. Alexander and Mamaea were soon rehabilitated.
As his cousin's activities, religious, political, and personal, became
increasingly unacceptable, Alexander was drawn ever more into public life.
In mid 221, he assumed the <i>toga virilis</i>, was adopted by<b><a href="elagabal.html">
Elagabalus</a></b> as a colleague, was granted the name <i>Alexander</i>,
and elevated to the rank of <i>Caesar</i>. There had been talk that he
was the illegitimate child of <b><a href="caracala.html">Caracalla</a></b>,
which won him support among the army, and this was confirmed, at least
for public consumption, by his filiation in the official titulature back
to <b><a href="sepsev.html">Septimius</a></b>. He was now styled <i>Imp.
Caes. M. Aurelii Antonini Pii Felicis Aug. fil., divi Antonini Magni Pii
nepos, divi Severi pronepos M. Aurelius Alexander, nobilissimus Caesar
imperi et sacerdotis, princeps iuventutis</i>. The connection with <b><a href="sepsev.html">Septimius
Severus</a></b> was crucial, since he was the only one of these predecessors
who had been deified. Alexander was about 12Â½ years old. Less than
a year later, on March 13, 222, with the murder of<b><a href="elagabal.html">
Elagabalus</a></b>, Alexander was hailed as emperor by the army.&nbsp;
He considered this date as his <i>dies imperii</i>. He became thereby the
youngest emperor in Rome's history. He was immediately thereafter given
the titles of <i>Augustus</i>,
<i>pater patriae</i>, and <i>pontifex maximus</i>.
</p><center>
<p><b>His Principate; Grandmother, Mother, Ulpian</b></p></center>

<p>Having had no experience in government, the young emperor was largely
dependent upon the two senior women in his life to guide his actions.<b><a href="#N_2_">[[2]]</a></b>&nbsp;
His grandmother, Julia Maesa (<i>PIR<sup>2</sup></i> I 678), may well have
died as early as 223,<b><a href="#N_3_">[[3]]</a></b> so that his mother,
Julia Mamaea, played the major role in the empire's administration from
early on until the end<b><a href="#N_4_">.[[4]]&nbsp;</a></b> The only
other figures who could rival her were the two Praetorian Prefects, both
eminent jurists, Ulpian (<i>PIR</i><sup>2</sup> D 169) and Paulus (<i>PIR<sup>2</sup></i>I
453),<b><a href="#N_5_">[[5]]</a></b> who are well-known to us because
of the numerous citations of their legal views and administrative decisions
preserved in the <i>Corpus Iuris Civilis</i>. Both were members of Alexander's
<i>consilium</i>.
Alexander attempted to restore some of the senate's prestige and functions,
but with little success. He was even unable to protect Ulpian against the
anger of the praetorians, who then murdered the jurist in 223<b><a href="#N_6_">.[[6]]</a></b>
</p><p>Had his principate been peaceful, he might have developed into a significant
emperor, certainly in comparison with his immediate predecessors. He was
married once, in 225 to Sallustia Orbiana (<i>PIR</i> S 252), who received
the official titulature <i>Sallustia Barbia Orbiana Augusta</i>,&nbsp;
but she was banished to Libya two years later<b><a href="#N_7_">.[[7]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Her father,&nbsp;<a name="Note xx"></a>L. Seius Sallustius (<i>PIR<sup>2</sup></i>
M 27), was perhaps raised to the rank of <i>Caesar</i> by Alexander and
was put to death in 227 on a charge of attempted murder of the emperor.
The only other recorded uprising against Alexander is that of&nbsp;<a name="Note xy"></a>Taurinus
(<i>PIR</i> T 29), who was hailed as <i>Augustus</i> but drowned himself
in the Euphrates<b><a href="#N_8_">.[[8]]</a></b>
</p><p>According to the <i>HA</i> life, Alexander was a "good" person, and
his mother certainly attempted to guide him well, but much of the last
decade of his reign was preoccupied with serious military threats against
the empire's prestige, nay existence. In those dangerous circumstances,
his abilities, which had not earlier been honed, proved inadequate.
</p><center>
<p><b>Domestic Policy</b></p></center>

<p>Perhaps the greatest service which Alexander furnished Rome, certainly
at the beginning of his reign, was the return to a sense of sanity and
tradition after the madness and fanaticism of <b><a href="elagabal.html">Elagabalus</a></b>.
He is said to have honored and worshipped a variety of individuals, including
Christ.<b><a href="#N_9_">[[9]]</a></b>&nbsp; His amiability assisted his
relationship with the senate, which gained in honor under him without any
real increase in its power. Besides jurists in high office, literary figures
were also so distinguished; Marius Maximus, the biographer, and Dio Cassius,
the historian, gained second consulships, the former in 223, the latter
in 229.
</p><p>The emperor's building program made its mark upon the face of Rome.
The last of the eleven great aqueducts, the <i>aqua Alexandrina</i>, was
put into service in 226; he also rebuilt the <i>thermae Neronianae</i>
in the Campus Martius in the following year and gave them his own name.
Of the other constructions, perhaps the most intriguing are the <i>Diaetae
Mammaeae, </i>apartments which he built for his mother on the Palatine<b><a href="#N_10_">.[[10]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b>The Persian and German Wars</b></p></center>

<p>The first great external challenge appeared in the east, where the Parthian
dynasty, which had ruled the Iranian plateau and other large areas for
centuries, and who for long had been one of Rome's great rivals, was overthrown
by the Persian family of the Sassanids by 227. They aspired to restore
their domain to include all the Asian lands which had been ruled in the
glory days of the Persian Empire. Since this included Asia Minor as well
as all other eastern provinces, the stage was set for continuing clashes
with Rome<b><a href="#N_11_">.[[11]]</a></b>
</p><p>These began late in the decade, with significant success early on for
the Sassanids. But Rome gradually developed a defense against these incursions,
and ultimately the emperor, with his mother and staff, went to the east
in 231. There actual military command rested in the hands of his generals,
but his presence gave additional weight to the empire's policy. Persia's
early successes soon faded as Rome's armies brought their power and experience
to bear. The result was an acceptance of the
<i>status quo</i> rather than
a settlement between the parties. This occurred in 233 and Alexander returned
to Rome. His presence in the west was required by a German threat, particularly
along the Rhine, where the tribes took advantage of the withdrawal of Roman
troops for the eastern war<b><a href="#N_12_">.[[12]]</a></b>
</p><p>In 234, Alexander and Julia Mammaea moved to Moguntiacum (Mainz), the
capital of Upper Germany. The military situation had improved with the
return of troops from the east, and an ambitious offensive campaign was
planned, for which a bridge was built across the Rhine. But Alexander preferred
to negotiate for peace by buying off the enemy. This policy outraged the
soldiers, who mutinied in mid March 235 and killed the emperor and his
mother.<b><a href="#N_13_">[[13]]</a></b> He had reached the age of 26Â½
years and had been emperor for almost precisely half his life.<b><a href="#N_14_">[[14]]</a></b>&nbsp;
He was deified by the senate and received other posthumous honors.<b><a href="#N_15_">[[15]]</a></b>
With the accession of <b><a href="maxthrax.html">Maximinus Thrax,</a></b>
the Severan dynasty came to an end.
</p><center>
<p><b>Death and Evaluation</b></p></center>

<p>Tacitus' famous dictum about <b><a href="galba.html">Galba,</a></b> that
he was properly considered <i>capax imperii</i>, capable of being emperor,
until he showed, when emperor, that he was not,<b><a href="#N_16_">[[16]]
</a></b>could
never have been applied to Severus Alexander. A child when chance brought
him to the principate, with only two recommendations, that he was different
from <b><a href="elagabal.html">Elagabalus</a></b> and that he was part
of the Severan family, he proved to be inadequate for the challenges of
the time. Military experience was the prime attribute of an emperor now,
which Alexander did not have, and that lack ultimately cost him his life<b><a href="#N_17_">.[[17]]</a></b>
Guided by his mother and employing the services of distinguished men, he
returned dignity to the imperial household and to the state<b><a href="#N_18_">.[[18]]&nbsp;</a></b>
He did the best he could, but that best was not good enough in the early
decades of the third century A.D., with the great threats from east and
north challenging Rome's primacy and, indeed, existence.<b><a href="#N_19_">[[19]]</a></b>
