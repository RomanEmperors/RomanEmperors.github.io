<h3>
<b>(Claudia) Octavia, wife of Nero</b></h3></center>

<center>
<h4>
Donna Hurley</h4></center>

<p>Octavia, properly Claudia Octavia, was the daughter of the emperor <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius
</a></b>and
his third wife <b><a href="valmess.html">Valeria Messallina.</a></b> She
was born in early 40 at the latest, but perhaps a year or two earlier,
because her younger brother<b><a href="britty.html"> Britannicus</a></b>
was born in February of 41. <b><a href="N_1_">[[1]]</a></b> Like all imperial
princesses, Octavia would be a pawn in the dynastic marriage game. <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>
was not a young man when he became emperor in January of AD 41, and he
lost no time in establishing a potential line of succession for himself.
Designated heirs could help stabilize a principate that was shaky from
its inception and hopefully make him less vulnerable to a palace coup.
He immediately married Antonia, a daughter by his earlier wife Aelia Paetina,
to Pompeius Magnus, and he betrothed Octavia, still a very small child,
to Lucius Junius Silanus, a cousin of several removes. <b><a href="N_2_">[[2]]</a></b>
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>Silanus was 15 or16 at the time. <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>
would advance and honor him as quickly as possible despite his youth. But
Silanus would give way to a replacement candidate before he and Octavia
could be married, for a new plan for the succession had taken priority.
When <b><a href="valmess.html">Messallina</a></b> was dead and a new marriage
had been arranged between <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudiu</a></b>s and
his niece, <b><a href="aggieii.html">Agrippina (the Younger)</a></b>, Octavia
was transferred to <b><a href="aggieii.html">Agrippina's</a></b> son by
an earlier marriage. The boy's name was still <b><a href="nero.html">Lucius
Domitius Ahenobarbus</a></b>, but he would become the emperor <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b>.
In order to make room for this new fiancé, Octavia's engagement
to Silanus was dissolved quickly and harshly. He was charged with incest
with his sister and removed from the senate and so from his praetorship
in the last days of AD 48. He committed suicide early in 49 on the wedding
day of <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b> and <b><a href="aggieii.html">Agrippina</a></b>.
<b><a href="N_3_">[[3]]</a></b>
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>The next year (AD 50) <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b> adopted
his stepson Domitius and gave him the name <b><a href="nero.html">Tiberius
Claudius Nero Caesar</a></b>. This new situation made it necessary that
Octavia be adopted out of her birth family and into another family so that
the marriage between the two (now technically siblings) could still take
place. They were married in 53 when they were minimally old enough. Their
union, if it produced progeny, would dissolve the long conflict between
the two major branches of the family. <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b>
was a direct descendent of <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b> through
the female line and Octavia was descended from <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>'
sister, after whom she was named, and from <b><a href="livia.html">Livia</a></b>,
<b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus'</a></b>
wife.<b><a href="N_4_"> [[4]]</a></b>
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p><b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b> died in AD 54, and <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b>
was hailed emperor at the age of sixteen. But uncertainty about the succession
would linger, for there were those who would have preferred that <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius'</a></b>
son <b><a href="britty.html">Britannicus</a></b> succeed his father. <b><a href="britty.html">Britannicus
</a></b>was
still too young, but it would not be long before he was technically an
adult, and it could be argued that a natural son deserved precedence over
an adoptive son. Neronian propaganda countered with the insinuation that
the paternity of both <b><a href="britty.html">Britannicus</a></b> and Octavia
was in question because of the their mother 's promiscuity.
<b><a href="nero.html">Nero
</a></b>soon (AD 55) had <b><a href="britty.html">Britannicus</a></b> poisoned.
Octavia remained at the center of this contention. <b><a href="N_5_">[[5]]</a></b>
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>Furthermore, the carefully contrived marriage between Octavia and <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b>
was a disaster on a personal level. <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b>
soon embarked on a serious relationship with a freedman named Acte, and
more importantly developed an active dislike for his wife. "Quickly feeling
aversion to intimacy with Octavia, he replied to his friends who were finding
fault with him that she ought to be satisfied with the outward trappings
of a wife." <b><a href="N_6-">[[6]</a></b>] This antipthy was not likely
to produce offspring who would unite the Julian and Claudian lines. By
58 <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b> was becoming involved with a freeborn
mistress, <b><a href="poppaeas.html">Poppaea,</a></b> whom he would want
to make his empress in exchange for Octavia. But the legitimacy of his
principate derived from his relationship with his predecessor, and he was
not so secure that he could do without the connection with <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>
provided through his mother and his wife. In 59 he was able to arrange
for <b><a href="aggieii.html">Agrippina's</a></b> death, but it was not
until 62 that he felt free to divorce Octavia and marry <b><a href="poppaea.html">Poppaea</a></b>.
The initial grounds for putting Octavia aside was the charge that she was
barren because she had had no children. But a more aggressive attack was
needed when opposition arose from those who still challenged <b><a href="nero.htm/">Nero's</a></b>
prncipate and remained loyal to Octavia as the last representative of her
family. With the connivance of <b><a href="poppaea.html">Poppaea</a></b>,
charges of adultery were added, Octavia was banished to Campania and then
to the island of Pandataria off the coast, and finally killed. Her severed
head was sent to Rome. <b><a href="N_7_">[[7]]</a></b>
</p><p>The ancient tradition presents Octavia as a victim, a passive and pathetic
figure. In reality she was used and indeed ill used. "Her wedding day was
as a funeral for her, who was married into a house in which there was nothing
but mourning since her father and then quickly her brother had been poisoned."<b><a href="N_8_">[[8]]</a></b>
After the death of <b><a href="britty.html">Britannicus</a></b> and then
of <b><a href="aggieii.html">Agrippina</a></b>, Octavia was the sole remnant
of the <i>domus Claudia, </i>the Claudian house. She was the last to leave
the stage. Her lonely isolation was the theme of<i> </i>a tragedy (<i>Octavia</i>)
written by an unknown playwright not long after the death of <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b>.
