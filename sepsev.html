<h3>Septimius Severus (193-211 A.D.)</h3>

</p><h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Lucius Septimius Severus
restored stability to the Roman empire after the tumultuous reign of
the emperor <a href="commod.html"><b>Commodus</b></a> and the civil wars 
that erupted in the wake of <a href="commod.html"><b>Commodus'</b></a>  
murder. However, by giving greater pay and benefits to soldiers and
annexing the troublesome lands of northern Mesopotamia into the Roman
empire, Septimius Severus brought increasing financial and military
burdens to Rome's government. His prudent administration allowed these
burdens to be met during his eighteen years on the throne, but
his reign was not entirely sunny. The bloodiness with which Severus gained and maintained control of the empire tarnished his
generally positive reputation.</p>
<h3>Severus' Early Life and Acclamation</h3>
<p>Severus was born 11 April 145 in the African city of Lepcis Magna,
whose magnificent ruins are located in modern Libya, 130 miles east
of Tripoli. Septimius Severus came from a distinguished local family
with cousins who received suffect consulships in Rome under 
<a href="tonypis.html"><b>Antoninus Pius</b></a>. The future emperor's father
 seems not to have held any major
offices, but the grandfather may have been the wealthy equestrian
Septimius Severus commemorated by the Flavian-era poet Statius.<a href="#N_1_"><b>[[1]]</b></a></p>
<p>The future emperor was helped in his early career by one of his
consular cousins, who arranged entry into the senate and the favor of
the emperor <a href="marcaur.html"><b>Marcus Aurelius</b></a>. Life as a senator meant a life of travel
from one government posting to another. Moorish attacks on his intended
post of Baetica (southern Spain) forced Severus to serve his
quaestorship in Sardinia. He then traveled to Africa as a legate and
returned to Rome to be a tribune of the plebs. Around the year 175 he
married Paccia Marciana, who seems also to have been of African origin.
The childless marriage lasted a decade or so until her death.</p>

<p>Severus' career continued to flourish as the empire passed
from <a href="marcaur.html"><b>Marcus</b></a> to <a href="commod.html"><b>Commodus</b></a>. The young senator held a praetorship, then
served in Spain, commanded a legion in Syria and held the governorships
of Gallia Lugdunensis (central France), Sicily and Upper Pannonia
(easternmost Austria and western Hungary). While in Gallia Lugdunensis
in 187, the now-widowed future emperor married Julia Domna, a woman
from a prominent family of the Syrian city of Emesa. Two sons quickly
arrived, eleven months apart: <a href="caracala.html"><b>Bassianus</b></a> (known to history as <a href="caracala.html"><b>Caracalla</b></a>)
in April of the year 188, and <a href="geta.html"><b>Geta</b></a> in March 189.</p>


<p>News of  <a href="pertinax.html"><b>Pertinax's</b></a> assassination 28 March 193 in an uprising by the praetorian
guard quickly reached Pannonia, and only twelve
days later on 9 April 193, Severus was proclaimed emperor.
Septimius Severus had the strong support of the armies along the Rhine
and Danube, but the loyalty of the governor of Britain, <a href="albinus.html"><b>Clodius
Albinus</b></a>, was in doubt. Severus' envoys from Pannonia offered <a href="albinus.html"><b>Albinus</b></a> the title
of Caesar, which he accepted.</p>
<h3> The Civil Wars with Albinus, Niger, and Didius Julianus</h3>
<p>In the city of Rome, <a href="didjul.html"><b>Didius Julianus</b></a> gained the support of the
praetorian troops and was promoted as the successor to <a href="pertinax.html"><b>Pertinax</b></a>.
Although <a href="didjul.html"><b>Julianus'</b></a> authority did not extend much beyond Italy,
Severus understood that legitimacy for a Roman emperor meant
having one's authority accepted in Rome. He and his army
began a swift march to the city. They met practically no resistance on
their advance from Pannonia into northern Italy, as <a href="didjul.html"><b>Julianus'</b></a>
supporters defected. By the beginning of June when Severus
reached Interamna, 50 miles north of Rome, even the praetorian guard
stationed in the capital switched sides. <a href="didjul.html"><b>Didius Julianus</b></a> was declared a public enemy and killed. Septimius Severus entered Rome without a
fight.</p>

<p>Civil war was not yet over. Another provincial governor also had his
eyes on the throne. In Syria, <a href="pniger.html"><b>Pescennius Niger</b></a> had been proclaimed
emperor on news of <a href="pertinax.html"><b>Pertinax's</b></a> death, and the eastern provinces quickly
went under his authority. Byzantium became <a href="pniger.html"><b>Niger's</b></a> base of operations
as he prepared to fight the armies of the west loyal to Severus.</p>

<p><a href="pniger.html"><b>Niger</b></a> was unable to maintain further advances into Europe. The fighting
moved to the Asian shore of the Propontis, and in late December 193 or
early January 194, <a href="pniger.html"><b>Niger</b></a> was defeated in a battle near Nicaea and fled
south. Asia and Bithynia fell under Severus' control, and
Egypt soon recognized Severus' authority. By late spring,
<a href="pniger.html"><b>Niger</b></a> was defeated near <a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;i_a_n242.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=472&quot;)"> <b>Issus</b></a> and the remainder of his support
collapsed. Syria was pacified. <a href="pniger.html"><b>Niger</b></a> was killed fleeing Antioch.  Byzantium, however, refused to surrender to Severan forces. <a href="pniger.html"><b>Niger's</b></a>
head was sent to the city to persuade the besieged citizens to give up,
but to no avail. The Byzantines held out for another year before
surrender. As punishment for their stubbornness, the walls of their
city were destroyed.</p>
<h3>Severus' Eastern Campaigns</h3>
<p>During the fighting, two of the peoples of upper Mesopotamia -- the
Osrhoeni and the Adiabeni -- captured some Roman garrisons and made an
unsuccessful attack on the Roman-allied city of Nisibis. After the
defeat of <a href="pniger.html"><b>Niger</b></a>, these peoples offered to return Roman captives and what remained of the seized treasures if the remaining Roman garrisons
were removed from the region. Severus refused the offer and
prepared for war against the two peoples, as well as against an Arabian
tribe that had aided <a href="pniger.html"><b>Niger</b></a>.  In the spring of 195, Severus marched an army through the
desert into upper Mesopotamia. The native peoples quickly surrendered,
and Severus added to his name the victorious titles <i>Arabicus</i>
and <i>Adiabenicus</i>. Much of the upper third of Mesopotamia was organized
as a Roman province, though the king of Osrhoene was allowed to retain
control of a diminished realm.</p>

<p>The tottering Parthian empire was less and less able to control those
peoples living in the border regions with Rome. Rome's eastern frontier
was entering a period of instability, and Severus responded
with an interventionist policy of attack and annexation. Some senators feared that increased involvement in Mesopotamia
would only embroil Rome in local squabbles at great expense. <a href="#N_2_"><b>[[2]]</b></a>   The
emperor, however, would remain consistent in his active eastern
policy.</p>
<h3>Legitimization of the Severan Dynasty</h3>
<p>Severus also took steps to cement his legitimacy as emperor
by connecting himself to the Antonine dynasty. Severus now
proclaimed himself the son of <a href="marcaur.html"><b>Marcus Aurelius</b></a>, which allowed him to trace his authority, through adoption, back to the emperor
<a href="nerva.html"><b>Nerva</b></a>. Julia Domna was awarded the title "Mother of the Camp"
(<i>mater castrorum</i>), a title only previously given to the
empress Faustina the Younger, <a href="marcaur.html"><b>Marcus'</b></a> wife. <a href="caracala.html"><b>Bassianus</b></a>, the emperor's
elder son, was renamed Marcus Aurelius Antoninus and given the title
Caesar. It was this last step that marked a decisive break with <a href="albinus.html"><b>Albinus</b></a>.</p>

<p><a href="albinus.html"><b>Albinus</b></a> had remained in Britain as governor during the struggles between Severus and <a href="pniger.html"><b>Niger</b></a>. Although <a href="albinus.html"><b>Albinus</b></a> had not attempted open
revolt against the emperor, he seems to have been in communication with
senators about future moves.<a href="#N_3_"><b>[[3]]</b></a> By the end of 195, <a href="albinus.html"><b>Albinus</b></a> was
declared a public enemy by Severus. The governor of Britain responded by
proclaiming himself emperor and invading Gaul.</p>
<p>
A weary Roman populace used the anonymity of the crowd at the chariot
races to complain about renewed civil war, but it was Gaul that bore
the brunt of the fighting. <a href="albinus.html"><b>Albinus</b></a> and his supporters were able to
inflict losses on the occasion of the initial attacks, but disorder was so great that
opportunistic soldiers could easily operate on their own within the
lands under <a href="albinus.html"><b>Albinus'</b></a> nominal control.</p>

<p>The tide began to turn early in 197, and after a Severan victory at
Tournus, <a href="albinus.html"><b>Albinus</b></a> found himself and his army trapped near <a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;lug197.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=471&quot;)"> <b>Lyon</b></a>. A battle
broke out 19 February 197. In the initial fighting, <a href="albinus.html"><b>Albinus'</b></a> troops
forced the Severans into retreat, during which Severus fell
off his horse. When the Severan cavalry appeared, however, <a href="albinus.html"><b>Albinus'</b></a>
army was routed. Lyon was sacked and <a href="albinus.html"><b>Albinus</b></a>, who was trapped in a
house along the river Rh ne, committed suicide. Severus
ordered <a href="albinus.html"><b>Albinus'</b></a> head to be cut off and sent to Rome for display.  Many of <a href="albinus.html"><b>Albinus'</b></a> supporters were killed, including a large number of
Spanish and Gallic aristocrats. <a href="albinus.html"><b>Albinus'</b></a> wife and children were
killed, as were many of the wives of his supporters. Tradition also
told of the mutilation of bodies and denial of proper burial. The
emperor revealed a penchant for cruelty that troubled even his fervent
supporters. A purge of the senate soon followed. Included among the		
victims was <a href="pertinax.html"><b>Pertinax's</b></a>  father-in-law, Sulpicianus.</p>
<h3>Severus and the Roman Military</h3>
<p>Severus brought many changes to the Roman military. Soldiers'
pay was increased by half, they were allowed to be married while in
service, and greater opportunities were provided for promotion into
officer ranks and the civil service. The entire praetorian guard,
discredited by the  murder of <a href="pertinax.html"><b>Pertinax</b></a> and the auctioning of their
support to <a href="didjul.html"><b>Julianus</b></a>, was dismissed. The emperor created a new,
larger praetorian guard out of provincial soldiers from the legions.
Increases were also made to the two other security forces based in
Rome: the urban cohorts, who maintained order; and the night watch, who
fought fires and dealt with overnight disturbances, break-ins and other
petty crime. These military reforms proved expensive, but the measures
may well have increased soldiers' performance and morale in an
increasingly unsettled age.</p>
<p>
One location that remained unsettled was the eastern frontier. In 197
Nisibis had again been under siege, and the emperor prepared for
another eastern campaign. Three new legions were raised, though one was
left behind in central Italy to maintain order. The Roman armies easily
swept through upper Mesopotamia, traveling down the Euphrates to sack
Seleucia, Babylon and <a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;ctesi198.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=470&quot;)"> <b>Ctesiphon</b></a>, which had been abandoned by the
Parthian king Vologaeses V. On 28 January 198 -- the centenary of
<a href="trajan.html"><b>Trajan's</b></a> accession -- Severus took the victorious title
<i>Parthicus Maximus</i> and promoted both of his sons: <a href="caracala.html"><b>Caracalla</b></a> to the rank
of Augustus and <a href="geta.html"><b>Geta</b></a> to the rank of Caesar.</p>

<p>Before embarking on the eastern campaign, the emperor had named Gaius
Fulvius Plautianus as a praetorian prefect. Plautianus came from the
emperor's home town of Lepcis, and the prefect may even have been a
relative of the emperor<a href="#N_4_"><b>[[4]]</b></a> The victories in Mesopotamia were followed
by tours of eastern provinces, including Egypt. Plautianus accompanied
Severus throughout the travels, and by the year 201
Plautianus was the emperor's closest confidant and advisor. Plautianus
was also praetorian prefect without peer after having arranged the
murder of his last colleague in the post.</p>

<p>Upon the return to Rome in 202, the influence of Plautianus was at its
height. Comparisons were made with Sejanus, the powerful praetorian
prefect under the emperor <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>. Plautianus, who earlier had been
adlected into the senate, was now awarded consular rank, and his
daughter Plautilla was married to <a href="caracala.html"><b>Caracalla</b></a>. The wealth Plautianus had
acquired from his close connection with the emperor enabled him to
provide a dowry said to have been worthy of fifty princesses.<a href="#N_5_"><b> [[5]]</b></a>
Celebrations and games also marked the <i>decennalia</i>, the
beginning of the tenth year of Severus' reign. Later in the
year the enlarged imperial family traveled to Lepcis, where native sons
Severus and Plautianus could display their prestige and
power.</p>

<p>The following year the imperial family returned to Rome, where an arch,
still standing today, was dedicated to the emperor at the western end
of the Forum. Preparations were also being made for the Secular Games,
which were thought to have originated in earliest Rome and were to be
held every 110 years. <a href="auggie.html"><b>Augustus</b></a> celebrated the Secular Games in 17 B.C.,
and <a href="domitian.html"><b> Domitian</b></a> in A.D. 88, six years too early. (<a href="claudius.html"><b>Claudius</b></a> used the excuse
of  Rome's 800th year to hold the games in A.D. 47.) In 204 Severus would preside over ten days of ceremonies and spectacles.</p>

<p>By the end of 204, Plautianus was finding his influence with the
emperor on the wane. <a href="caracala.html"><b>Caracalla</b></a> was not happy to be the husband of
Plautilla. Julia Domna resented Plautianus' criticisms and
investigations against her. Severus was tiring of his
praetorian prefect's ostentation, which at times seemed to surpass that
of the emperor himself. The emperor's ailing brother, Geta, also
denounced Plautianus, and after Geta's death the praetorian prefect
found himself being bypassed by the emperor. In January 205 a soldier
named Saturninus revealed to the emperor a plot by Plautianus to have
Severus and <a href="caracala.html"><b>Caracalla</b></a> killed. Plautianus was summoned to the
imperial palace and executed. His children were exiled, and <a href="caracala.html"><b>Caracalla</b></a>
divorced Plautilla. Some observers suspected the story of a plot was
merely a ruse to cover up long-term plans for Plautianus' removal.
<a href="#N_6_"><b>[[6]]</b></a></p>
<h3> Severus and Roman Law</h3>	
<p>Two new praetorian prefects were named to replace Plautianus, one of
whom was the eminent jurist Papinian. The emperor's position as
ultimate appeals judge had brought an ever-increasing legal workload to
his office. During the second century, a career path for legal experts
was established, and an emperor came to rely heavily upon his
<i>consilium,</i> an advisory panel of experienced jurists, in
rendering decisions.  Severus brought these jurists to even greater prominence. A
diligent administrator and conscientious judge, the emperor appreciated
legal reasoning and nurtured its development. His reign ushered in the
golden age of Roman jurisprudence, and his court employed the talents
of the three greatest Roman lawyers: Papinian, Paul and Ulpian.</p>

<p>The order Severus was able to impose on the empire through
both the force of arms and the force of law failed to extend to his own
family. His now teenaged sons, <a href="caracala.html"><b>Caracalla</b></a> and <a href="geta.html"><b>Geta</b></a>, displayed a reckless
sibling rivalry that sometimes resulted in physical injury. The emperor
believed the lack of responsibilities in Rome contributed to the
ill-will between his sons and decided that the family would travel to
Britain to oversee military operations there. <a href="caracala.html"><b>Caracalla</b></a> was involved in
directing the army's campaigns, while <a href="geta.html"><b>Geta</b></a> was given civilian authority
and a promotion to joint emperor with his father and brother.</p>

<p>Severus was now into his 60s. Chronic gout limited his
activities and sapped his strength. The emperor's health continued to
deteriorate in Britain, and he became ever more intent on trying to
improve the bitter relationship between his two sons. He is reported to
have given his sons three pieces of advice: "Get along; pay off the
soldiers; and disregard everyone else." <a href="#N_7_"><b>[[7]]</b></a> The first piece of advice
would not be heeded.</p>

<p>Severus died in York on 4 February 211 at the age of 65. His
reign lasted nearly 18 years, a duration that would not be matched
until <a href="dioclet.html"><b>Diocletian</b></a>. Culturally and ideologically Septimius Severus
connected his reign to the earlier Antonine era, but the reforms he
enacted would eventually alter the very character of Roman government.
By creating a larger and more expensive army and increasing the influence of
lawyers in administration, Severus planted the seeds that
would develop into the highly militaristic and bureaucratic government
of the later empire.</p>
