<h3><b>Hadrian (A.D. 117-138)</b></h3>

<center><p><b>Herbert W. Benario</b></p></center>

<p>Emory University</p>
 <p></p>

<p><strong>Introduction and Sources</strong></p>
<p>"During a happy period of more than fourscore years, the public administration was 
conducted by
the virtue and abilities of Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, and the two Antonines.  It is the design 
of this and of the two succeeding chapters to describe the prosperous 
condition of their empire, and afterwards, from the death of Marcus Antoninus, to
 deduce the most important circumstances of its decline and fall, a revolution 
which will ever be remembered and is still felt by the nations of the earth."</p>

<p>So Edward Gibbon concluded the first chapter of his massive 
<em>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</em>, referring to a
period which he also styled the happiest of mankind's history.  Hadrian was the 
central figure of these "five good emperors," the one most responsible for changing the 
character and nature of the empire.  He was also one of the 
most remarkable and talented individuals Rome ever produced.</p>
<p>The sources for a study of Hadrian are varied.  There is no major historian for his reign, such as
Tacitus or Livy.  The chief literary sources are the biography in the <em>Historia Augusta</em>, the first
surviving life in a series intended to continue Suetonius' <em>Lives of the Caesars.</em><a href="#N_1_"><b>[[1]]</b></a>  Debate about
this collection of imperial biographies has been heated and contentious for more than a century. 
The most convincing view is that which sees the whole as the work of a single author writing in
the last years of the fourth century.  The information offered ranges from the precisely accurate to
the most wildly imaginative.<a href="#N_2_"><b>[[2]]</b></a></p>
<p>Cassius Dio, who wrote in the decade of the 230s, produced a long history of the empire which
has survived, for the Hadrianic period, only in an abbreviated version.<a href="#N_4_"><b>[[3]</b></a>]  Fourth century
historians, such as Aurelius Victor and Eutropius, occasionally furnish bits of information. 
Contemporaries or near-contemporaries of Hadrian, such as Arrian, Fronto, Pausanias, and
Plutarch, are also useful.  Papyri, inscriptions, coins, and legal writings are extremely important. 
Archaeology in all its aspects contributes mightily to any attempt to probe the character of a man
and emperor whose personality and thoughts defy close analysis and understanding.</p>
<p><strong>Early Life and Career</strong></p>
<p>Hadrian was born on January 24, 76.  Where he saw the light of day was, even in antiquity, matter
for debate.  Italica, in Hispania Baetica, was the birthplace of <a href="trajan.html"><b>Trajan</b></a> and was also considered that
of Hadrian.  But the <em>HA</em> reports that he was born in Rome, and that seems the more likely choice,
since it is the more unexpected.  The actual place of one's birth was, however, unimportant, since
it was one's <em>patria</em> which was crucial.  Hadrian's ancestors had come to Spain generations before,
from the town of Hadria in Picenum, at the end of the Second Punic War.  Italica's <em>tribus</em>, to
which Hadrian belonged, was the <em>Sergia</em>.  His father, P. Aelius Afer, had reached the praetorship
by the time of his death in 85/86, his mother, Domitia Paulina, came from a distinguished family of
Gades, one of the wealthiest cities in the empire.  His sister Paulina married Servianus, who played
a significant role in Hadrian's career.  <a href="trajan.html"><b>Trajan</b></a> was the father's cousin; when Afer died, <a href="trajan.html"><b>Trajan</b></a> and
P. Acilius Attianus, likewise of Italica, became Hadrian's guardians.<a href="#N_4_"><b>[[4]]</b></a></p>
<p>At the age of about ten, Hadrian went to Italica for the first time (or returned, if he had been there
earlier in his childhood), where he remained for only a brief time.  He then returned to the capital
and soon began a rapid rise through the <em>cursus honorum</em>; he was a military tribune of three
different legions in consecutive years, a series of appointments which clearly marked him for a
military career, and reached the consulate as a suffect at the age of 32, the earliest possible under
the principate.  At <a href="trajan.html"><b>Trajan's</b></a> death, he was legate of the province of Syria, with responsibility for
the security of the east in the aftermath of <a href="trajan.html"><b>Trajan's</b></a> Parthian War.</p>
<p>His career as a <em>privatus</em> follows:</p>
<br><i>decemvir stlitibus iudicandis</i>
<br><i>sevir turmae equitum Romanorum</i>
<br><i>praefectus urbi feriarum Latinarum</i>
<br><i>trib. militum legionis II Adiutricis Piae Fidelis</i> (95, in 
Pannonia inferior)
<br><i>trib. militum legionis V Macedonicae </i>(96, in Moesia inferior)
<br><i>trib. militum legionis XXII Primigeniae Piae Fidelis</i> (97, in 
Germania superior)
<br><i>quaestor</i> (101)
<br><i>ab actis senatus </i>
<br><i>tribunus plebis</i> (105)
<br><i>praetor</i> (106)
<br><i>legatus legionis I Minerviae Piae Fidelis</i> (106, in Germania 
inferior)
<br><i>legatus Augusti pro praetore Pannoniae inferioris</i> (107)
<br><i>consul suffectus</i> (108)
<br><i>septemvir epulonum</i> (before 112)
<br><i>sodalis Augustalis</i> (before 112)
<br><i>archon Athenis</i> (112/13)
<br><i>legatus Syriae</i> (117)
<p>(Some of these dates are less than secure; important for much of this information is the Athens
inscription [Smallwood 109]).</p>
<p><strong>Relationship to Trajan, Marriage, and Adoption</strong></p>
<p>Hadrian's only male relative after the death of his father was <a href="trajan.html"><b>M. Ulpius Traianus</b></a>, his father's
cousin, hence his own first cousin once removed.  <a href="trajan.html"><b>Trajan</b></a> and his wife, Pompeia Plotina, had no
children, and were surrogate parents to the child Hadrian.  Trajan's influence in government was
steadily increasing, both through his own merits and because of his father's great services to
Vespasian in the civil wars and afterwards.<a href="#N_5_"><b>[[5]]</b></a>  When <a href="trajan.html"><b>Trajan</b></a> was adopted by <a href="nerva.html"><b>Nerva</b></a> and
designated successor in late 97, Hadrian carried the congratulations of the Moesian legions to him
along the Rhine, and was kept there by <a href="trajan.html"><b>Trajan</b></a> to serve in a German legion.  In 100, largely at the
instance of Plotina, Hadrian married <a href="trajan.html"><b>Trajan's</b></a> grand-niece Vibia Sabina, ten years his junior.  This
marriage was not a happy one, although it endured until her death in 136 or 137.  There were no
children, and it was reported that Sabina performed an abortion upon herself in order not to
produce another monster.<a href="#N_6_"><b>[[6]]</b></a>  In spite of marital unhappiness, the union was crucial for Hadrian,
because it linked him even more closely with the emperor's family.  He got along very well with
his mother-in-law Matidia and with the empress, whose favor enhanced his career.</p>
<p>In mid-summer 117, when <a href="trajan.html"><b>Trajan</b></a> was returning from his Parthian campaigns, he fell ill while at
Selinus in Cilicia and died on August 8.  The following day his adoption of Hadrian was
announced by Plotina and Attianus, the praetorian prefect who had earlier been Hadrian's
guardian, with some question whether <a href="trajan.html"><b>Trajan</b></a> had indeed performed the act or whether it was
posthumous, thanks to his widow.  On August 11, which he considered his <em>dies imperii</em>, the army
of Syria hailed its legate, Hadrian, as emperor, which made the senate's formal acceptance an
almost meaningless event.  This was an example of the historian Tacitus' famous dictum that an
emperor could be made elsewhere than at Rome.<a href="#N_7_"><b>[[7]]</b></a></p>
<p><strong>Succession and the Affair of the Four Consulars</strong></p>
<p>Hadrian chose as his official title <em>Imperator Caesar Traianus Hadrianus Augustus</em> (for much of
the decade of the 120s, he was simply known as Hadrianus Augustus).  He must then have
proceeded to Selinus at once from Antioch, to catch up with Attianus, Plotina, and Matidia.  He
then returned to his province no later than September and stayed there at least into the new year,
consolidating his administration.  He began the year as <em>cos</em>. II; whether he had been so designated
by <a href="trajan.html"><b>Trajan</b></a> is unknown.  On January 3, 118, the Arval Brethren met in Rome to offer vows for the
well-being of the emperor, which shows that he was not in the capital.  In June or July they sacrificed because of the arrival of the emperor who is present at the ceremony.  He therefore
may have taken as much as eleven months from his accession to return to Rome.  He saw to the
deification of his predecessor and celebrated games in honor of the consecration. <a href="trajan.html"><b> Trajan's</b></a> ashes
were placed in the base of his column, by special dispensation, since burials were prohibited within
the <i>pomerium</i>.</p>
<p>Anticipation of his arrival had been overshadowed by the execution of four men of great
importance, who had all held consulates and commands.  This action had been ordered by the
senate, perhaps at the instigation of the praetorian prefect Attianus.  Hadrian always disclaimed
responsibilty but his relations with the senate were irrevocably damaged, never really to improve
until his death, when the senate hoped to have posthumous revenge.  The four men were
Cornelius Palma (<i>cos.</i> II 109), who had been with <a href="trajan.html"><b>Trajan</b></a> in the east and had been governor of
Syria, Avidius Nigrinus (<i>cos</i>. 110), governor of Dacia, Publilius Celsus (<i>cos</i>. II 113), and Lusius
Quietus, a Moorish chieftain (<i>cos</i>. 117), governor of Judaea and one of <a href="trajan.html"><b>Trajan's</b></a> chief generals. 
Personal enmity toward Hadrian certainly existed, perhaps because of Hadrian's move away from
<a href="trajan.html"><b>Trajan's</b></a> policy of expansion, perhaps because of jealousy that Hadrian had been preferred for the
succession.  Be that as it may, they were all <a href="trajan.html"><b>Trajan's </b></a>men, and their elimination certainly made
Hadrian's course easier.  But the odium thereby raised caused him dismay until the end of his
days.<a href="#N_8_"><b>[[8]]</b></a>  He was <em>cos.</em> III in 119, which proved to be the last consulship he held.  He thereby showed
himself to be different from many of predecessors:  <a href="auggie.html"><b>Augustus</b></a> held 13, <a href="vespasia.html"><b>Vespasian</b></a> 9, <a href="titus.html"><b>Titus</b></a> 8,
<a href="domitian.html"><b>Domitian</b></a> 17, <a href="trajan.html"><b>Trajan</b></a> 6.  He was similarly sparing in his acceptance of other titles; he became <em>pater
patriae </em>only in 128.</p>
<p><strong>Foreign policy, wars, and travel</strong></p>
<p>In two important passages, Cassius Dio sets the tone for this section:</p>
<p>Once, when a woman made a request of him as he passed by on a journey, he at first said to her,
"I haven't time," but afterwards, when she cried out, "Cease, then, being emperor," he turned
about and granted her a hearing."  (69.6.3)</p>
<p>"Hadrian travelled through one province after another, visiting the various regions and cities and
inspecting all the garrisons and forts.  Some of these he removed to more desirable places, some
he abolished, and he also established some new ones.  He personally viewed and investigated
absolutely everything, not merely the usual appurtenances of camps, such as weapons, engines,
trenches, ramparts and palisades, but also the private affairs of every one, both of the men serving
in the ranks and of the officers themselves, - their lives, their quarters and their habits, - and he
reformed and corrected in many cases practices and arrangements for living that had become too
luxurious.  He drilled the men for every kind of battle, honouring some and reproving others, and
he taught them all what should be done.  And in order that they should be benefited by observing
him, he everywhere led a rigorous life and either walked or rode on horseback on all occasions,
never once at this period setting foot in either a chariot or a four-wheeled vehicle.  He covered his
head neither in hot weather nor in cold, but alike amid German snows and under scorching
Egyptian suns he went about with his head bare.  In fine, both by his example and by his precepts
he so trained and disciplined the whole military force throughout the entire empire that even to-day 
the methods then introduced by him are the soldiers' law of campaigning."  (69.9.1-4; both
passages in the translation of E. Cary in the Loeb edition)</p>
<p>These views of Hadrian stem from an historian who lived a century after the emperor's reign.  He
appears as a conscientious administrator, an inveterate traveler, and a general deeply concerned
for the well-being of his armies, and thus of the empire.  There was generally peace throughout its
lands, although his principate was not entirely peaceful.</p>
<p>First of all, he had to quash the Jewish uprising which had begun under <a href="trajan.html"><b>Trajan</b></a> and spread
throughout the diaspora.  Then there were disturbances in Mauretania, Dacia, and in northern
Britain.  Late in his reign, after deciding to resettle the site of Jerusalem as the city of Aelia
Capitolina and build a temple to Jupiter on the site of the Jewish temple, another uprising
occurred, more bitter still than its recent predecessor.</p>
<p>Hadrian's goal as emperor was to establish natural or man-made boundaries for the empire.  He
had realized that its extent had severely strained the empire's capacity to maintain and protect it. 
Consolidation was his policy, not expansion, and this brought him enmity in the early years, when
<a href="trajan.html"><b>Trajan's</b></a> eastern conquests were abandoned (a process already begun by <a href="trajan.html"><b>Trajan</b></a>) and withdrawal
from Dacia was contemplated.</p>
<p>Hadrian's own military experience was extensive.  He had served in provinces in the east, along
the Danube, and along the Rhine.  Soon after his arrival in Rome, he began the lengthy journeys
which took him to almost every province.  He was absent from Italy from 121 to 125, from 128 to
132, and from 134 to 136.  He spent more than half his reign traveling; he displayed a <em>Wanderlust</em>
unlike that of any of his predecessors, and sharply contrasting with the practice of his successor,
who never left Italy.</p>
<p>Evidence for his precise routes and his goals is often entirely absent.  One must frequently infer
from what is known, and most lists differ in some details.  The following is exemplary:</p>

<p>121 Gallia</p>

<p>Germania superior</p>

<p>Raetia</p>

<p>Noricum</p>

<p>Germania superior</p>

<p>122 Germania inferior</p>

<p>Britannia (where he began the construction of the</p>

<p>Wall which bears his name)</p>

<p>Gallia</p>

<p>Gallia Narbonensis (Nemausus)</p>

<p>Hispania (Tarraco)</p>

<p>123 Mauretania (?)</p>

<p>Africa (?)</p>

<p>Pisidia</p>

<p>Cilicia</p>

<p>Syria</p>

<p>Commagene (Samosata)</p>

<p>Cappadocia</p>

<p>Pontus</p>

<p>Syria (Antioch)</p>

<p>130 Judaea</p>

<p>Arabia</p>

<p>Egypt (Nile trip; death of Antinous; Alexandria)</p>

<p>131 Libyan desert</p>

<p>Syria</p>

<p>Asia</p>

<p>Athens</p>

<p>132 Rome</p>

<p>134 Syria</p>

<p>Judaea</p>

<p>Egypt (?)</p>

<p>Syria (Antioch)</p>

<p>135 Syria</p>

<p>136 Rome</p>

<p>His stay in the East these last years was necessitated by the Jewish War.  His recurrent visits to
Athens stemmed from his devotion to Greek culture and the city itself, which had elected him
archon while he was still a private citizen (112).  He much preferred the eastern provinces, the
Greek lands, to the western ones.  After 128/9, he was hailed as <em>Olympios</em>, after 132 as
<em>Panhellenios</em>, and also as <em>Panionios</em>. Otherwise, his travels were intended to gain intimate
knowledge of people and provinces, of the military in all its aspects, and to help produce a better
and securer life for almost all his subjects.</p>
<p><strong>Domestic policy and legal activity</strong></p>
<p>Hadrian was so little in Italy, compared with his time abroad, that his governmental policies at
home play a lesser role in consideration of his entire principate.  Yet they have significance,
because they display the same tendency toward order and consolidation as his external policies. 
When he arrived in Rome in July 118 to a hostile reception on the part of the senate, because of
the death of the four consulars, he devoted attention to matters of significance to the people.  He
pursued the honors due <a href="trajan.html"><b>Trajan</b></a>, their favorite, examined the financial ledgers of the empire and
discovered that there was an enormous sum of uncollectable debts, some 900,000,000 sesterces. 
He determined to remove these from the accounts and begin his reign with a clean slate. 
Consequently the records of these debts were publicly burned, an event which, obviously, gained
him public favor.<a href="#N_9_"><b>[[9]]</b></a>  It was represented in the relief of the <em>plutei Traiani</em>, presently displayed in
the Senate house in the Forum.<a href="#N_10_"><b>[[10]]</b></a>  He also continued and expanded the practice of the
<em>alimenta</em>, whereby state money was lent to individuals who paid interest to their local
communities. This money supported the local economy and helped maintain orphans.<a href="#N_11_"><b>[[11]]</b></a>  He
also ensured that the grain supply upon which Rome depended became more secure with his
dramatic building program in Ostia.<a href="#N_12_"><b>[[12]]</b></a></p>
<p>The most significant legal achievement was the codification of the praetorian and aedilician edicts. 
This task was assigned to Salvius Julianus, who produced one of the glories of Roman legal
science.   </p>

<p>Underscoring the importance of hADRIAN'S WORK, Kunkel in his magisterial survey
 of Roman law indicates, "Edicts were magistral proclamations whose content and scope might be very diverse. . . .
At least from the late Republic onwards litigants could, <em>vis-à-vis</em> a magistrate,
 rely on the contents of the edicts asconfidently as on a statute, for magistrates 
were by<a <em="">lex Cornelia of 67 B.C. strictly bound by their edicts."</a><a href="#N_13_"><b>[[13]]</b></a></p>
<p>These edicts, covering centuries, Julianus brought together into a straightforward and modern
document, which became the basis of subsequent praetorian and aedilician activity in the field of
law.  The Edict has been lost, but many excerpts made by commentators upon it have survived in
Justinian's <em>Code</em>.<a href="#N_14_"><b>[[14]]</b></a></p>
<p>Many letters and rescripts of Hadrian have survived, which, in their variety, illustrate the almost
infinite range of matters which were referred to the emperor.  Two important ones may be
exemplary.  In 121, at the request of Plotina, who was deeply interested in the Epicurean School at Athens, he
permits the presidency of the school to be assumed by someone who is not a Roman citizen,
thereby increasing the pool of potential candidates substantially.<a href="#N_15_"><b>[[15]]</b></a>
Hadrian's rescript to Minicius Fundanus is crucial for our understanding of the development of
Rome's relations with the Christians.  He essentially reiterates <a href="trajan.html"><b>Trajan's</b></a> response to Pliny (<em>Ep</em>.
10.97).  Minicius was governor of Asia in 124/5.  Hadrian's communication replied to a question
put to him by Minicius' predecessor, Serennius Granianus.<a href="#N_16_"><b>[[16]]</b></a></p>
<p><strong>Literary and artistic achievements</strong></p>
<p>Hadrian was a man of extraordinary talents, certainly one of the most gifted that Rome ever
produced.  He became a fine public speaker, he was a student of philosophy and other subjects,
who could hold his own with the luminaries in their fields, he wrote both an autobiography and
poetry, and he was a superb architect.  It was in this last area that he left his greatest mark, with
several of the empire's most extraordinary buildings and complexes stemming from his fertile
mind.  The anonymous author of the <i>Historia Augusta</i> described Hadrian as <em>Fuit enim poematum et litterarum nimium studiosissimus.  Arithmeticae, geometriae,
picturae peritissimus.</em><a href="#N_17_"><b>[[17]]</b></a></p>
<p>He rebuilt Agrippa's Pantheon into the remarkable building that survives today, reconstructing the
accustomed temple facade, with columns and pediment, but attaching it to a drum which was
surmounted by a coffered dome.  The latter was  pierced by an <em>oculus</em> nine meters in diameter,
which was the main source of illumination.  Height and diameter were identical, 43.3 meters.  The
dome remained the largest in the world until the twentieth century.  As was his custom, he
replaced the original inscription of Agrippa on the architrave; seldom did he put his own name on
a monument.<a href="#N_18_"><b>[[18]]</b></a></p>
<p>To complete <a href="trajan.html"><b>Trajan's</b></a> Forum, which had been planned by Apollodorus on a tremendous scale, he
added a large temple dedicated to the deified <a href="trajan.html"><b>Trajan</b></a> and Plotina.  He thereby made this forum
more similar to its four imperial predecessors, each of which had a temple as its focus.<a href="#N_19_"><b>[[19]]</b></a></p>
<p>On April 21, 121, the <em>dies natalis</em> of the city of Rome, Hadrian began construction of a temple
unique in design and larger than any other ever built by the Romans.  Its length of more than 100
meters made it the only Roman addition to the short list of temples built by the Greeks which were
at least that long.  Even more extraordinary was the interior, within a fully peripteral colonnade. 
There were two cellae, back to back, with an apse at the end in which were placed the statues of
the goddesses Venus and Roma, gigantic statues which, Apollodorus is said to have sneered,
would bang their heads if they got up.<a href="#N_20_"><b>[[20]]</b></a>  The temple dominated the east end of the Roman
forum, built on the heights of the Velia, overwhelming <a href="titus.html"><b>Titus'</b></a> Arch and facing the <i>Amphitheatrum
Flavium</i>.  He thereby linked his own achievements as conqueror of the Jews and great builder with
his Flavian predecessors.  Unlike <a href="vespasia.html"><b>Vespasian</b></a> and <a href="trajan.html"><b>Trajan</b></a>, who built new fora which bore their
names, Hadrian was more interested in individual monuments, the novelty and magnitude of which
would keep his name alive.<a href="#N_21_"><b>[[21]]</b></a>  Late in life, he began construction of a mausoleum, larger than that of Augustus, on the other side
of the Tiber and down river from it.  It was approached by a new bridge across the river, the <i>Pons
Aelius</i>.  The mausoleum had not been completed at the time of his death.<a href="#N_22_"><b>[[22]]</b></a>His most imaginative, nay stupendous, architectural achievement was his villa at Tibur, the
modern Tivoli, some 30 kilometers ENE of Rome, in the plain at the foot of the Sabine Hills.  It
covered some 700 acres and contained about 100 buildings, some of which were among the most
daring ever attempted in antiquity.  Here Hadrian reconstructed, so to speak, many of the places
which he had visited in his travels, such as the Canopus of Alexandria and the vale of Tempe.<a href="#N_23_"><b>[[23]]</b></a></p>
<p>He also left his mark on almost every city and province to which he came.  He paid particular
attention to Athens, where he completed the great temple of Olympian Zeus, some six centuries
after construction had begun, and made it the centerpiece of a new district of the city.   </p>
<p>Hadrian's relationship with philosophers and other scholars was generally fractious.  He often
scorned their achievements while showing his own superiority.  An anecdote about an argument which he had with the eminent philosopher and sophist Favorinus revealed the
inequity of such disagreement.  Although Favorinus was correct, he gave way to Hadrian, and
when rebuked by friends, replied, "You advise me badly, friends, since you do not permit me to
believe that he who commands thirty legions is the most learned of all."<a href="#N_24_"><b>[[24]]</b></a></p>
<p>Hadrian's literary taste inclined toward the archaic and the odd.  He preferred Cato to Cicero,
Ennius to Vergil, Coelius Antipater to Sallust, and disapproved of Homer and Plato as well. 
Indeed, the epic writer Antimachus of Colophon supplanted Homer in Hadrian's estimation.<a href="#N_25_"><b>[[25]]</b></a> 
The biographer Suetonius held office under Hadrian but was discharged in 122 for disrespect to
the empress.<a href="#N_26_"><b>[[26]]</b></a>  The historian Tacitus, who may have lived into Hadrian's reign, seems to have
found no favor with the emperor.</p>
<p>His best known literary work is the short poem which he is said to have composed shortly before
his death.  These five lines have caused commentators much interpretative woe.</p>

<br>animula vagula blandula

<br>hospes comesque corporis

<br>quae nunc abibis in loca

<br>pallidula rigida nudula
<br>nec ut soles dabis iocos!   (25.9)

<p>"Little soul, wandering and pale, guest and companion of my body, you who will now go off to
places pale, stiff, and barren, nor will you make jokes as has been your wont."<a href="#N_27_"><b>[[27]]</b></a></p>
<p>Another four lines of verse are preserved by the <em>HA</em>, part of an exchange with the poet Florus.
<a href="#N_28_"><b>[[28]]</b></a>  Mention is also made of his autobiography, which he had published under someone else's
name.<a href="#N_29_"><b>[[29]]</b></a></p>
<p><strong>Antinous</strong></p>
<p>Probably the aspect of Hadrian's life which is most widely known is his relationship with the
handsome youth Antinous. He was a Bithynian, born about 110, whom Hadrian met when the lad
was in his mid-teens.  He joined Hadrian's entourage and was with him in Egypt in the fall of 130. 
During the course of the emperor's Nile cruise, Antinous drowned.  The reason (or reasons) were
not known.  Conjecture of course abounded.  The <em>HA</em> suggests that Antinous offered himself to
save Hadrian's life and that there was a homosexual relationship between them.  Tradition also
reported that Antinous committed suicide because an oracle had stated that, if he did so, the
remaining years of life that he could expect would be transferred to the emperor.  There is even
the unsensational possibility that the childless emperor, whose relationship with his wife was at
best cool, looked upon the attractive young man as the son whom he had never had.  Whatever
the facts, Hadrian's grief was extravagant, and he caused the youth to be worshipped as a god
throughout the empire and cities in his honor were established in many places.  An Antinoopolis
rose along the Nile near the spot where he drowned.  Many statues of Antinous have survived,
which reveal his fleshy and attractive appearance.<a href="#N_30_"><b>[[30]]</b></a></p>
<p><strong>End of life and problems of succession</strong></p>
<p>When Hadrian returned to Rome in 136 from the east with its great responsibilities of the Jewish
War, his health had deteriorated markedly.  He was now 60 years old, lonely and despondent. 
The empress Sabina had died, Antinous was gone, few remained to whom he felt close.  He
therefore began to contemplate a successor, in order to avoid a situation such as had occurred
before his own accession.  Then, he was the obvious, indeed the only sensible choice; now, there
was no one who, by military distinction or close relationship with him, would stand out.  His
choice, L. Ceionius Commodus, was surprising, although he was <em>cos. ord.</em> when adopted. 
Nothing particularly recommended him other than powerful political connections.  His health was
bad and he had no military experience, his career having been entirely in the civilian arena.  Some
scholars have suggested that he was Hadrian's bastard son, but that need not be believed. 
Nonetheless, his only recommendation was his good looks; his life was frivolous, his tastes
luxurious.  Hadrian's choice seems to have been an aberration of judgment.</p>
<p>Commodus died on the first day of the year 138.  Hadrian's next choice, a much happier one,
 was
<a href="tonypis.html"><b>T. Aurelius Fulvius Boionius Arrius Antoninus</b></a> known to history as <a href="tonypis.html"><b>Antoninus Pius</b></a>.  The scion of a distinguished consular family, he
had been born near Rome in 86, although his <em>patria</em> was Nemausus in Gallia Narbonensis.  Consul
in 120, at an early age, he soon thereafter served as one of the four <em>consulares</em> who had
jurisdiction of Italy.<a href="#N_31_"><b>[[31]]</b></a>  He reached the acme of a senatorial career with his governorship of Asia
about 134/5.  He was one of the most distinguished men of the age.</p>
<p>Hadrian caused <a href="tonypis.html"><b>Antoninus </b></a>to adopt two young men, who were intended to succeed him in the
fullness of years.  One was the seven-year-old son of Commodus, now named <a href="lverus.html"><b>Lucius Aelius
Aurelius Commodus</b></a>, the later <a href="lverus.html"><b>Lucius Verus</b></a>.  The other was the seventeen year old <a href="marcaur.html"><b>Marcus
Annius Verus</b></a>, now <a href="marcaur.html"><b>Marcus Aelius Aurelius Verus</b></a>, the later <a href="marcaur.html"><b>Marcus Aurelius</b></a>.  Upon <a href="tonypis.html"><b>Antoninus'</b></a>
 death in 161, they succeeded as co-emperors; Hadrian's foresight was thus rewarded.</p>
<p>Hadrian was at an imperial villa at Baiae, on the Bay of Naples, when he died on July 10, 138. 
The senate now felt it could repay the emperor for the wrongs done it from the beginning of his
reign and undertook to condemn his memory, in other words, <em>damnatio memoriae</em>.  But
<a href="tonypis.html"><b>Antoninus</b></a> fought against this condemnation of his adoptive father and gained deification instead. 
It is generally thought that it was for this action that he received the name of <em>Pius</em>.<a href="#N_32_"><b>[[32]]</b></a></p>
<p>Hadrian's ashes were placed in his mausoleum and he received the customary honors of having
been recognized as a <em>divus</em>, which above all recognized that he had ruled constitutionally.  A great
temple in the Campus Martius was built to his memory in the early 140s, now called the
Hadrianeum, one of the largest in Rome.  A substantial part survives.  The tall stylobate was
decorated with alternating reliefs of provinces and victories.  In all likelihood, there was a relief of
each of the 36 provinces which existed at the time of Hadrian's death.<a href="#N_33_"><b>[[33]]</b></a></p>
<p><strong>Reputation</strong></p>
<p>Hadrian died <em>invisus omnibus</em>, according to the author of the <em>Vita</em>.<a href="#N_34_"><b>[[34]]</b></a>  But his deification placed
him in the list of "good" emperors, a worthy successor to the <em>optimus princeps</em><a href="trajan.html"><b> Trajan</b></a>.  Hadrian
played a significant role both in developing the foreign policies of the empire and in its continuing
centralization in administration.  Few would disagree that he was one of the most remarkable men
Rome ever produced, and that the empire was fortunate to have him as its head.  When Aelius
Aristides delivered his oration <em>To Rome</em> in 143, he had Hadrian's empire in mind when he said,</p>

<p>"But there is that which very decidedly deserves as much
attention and admiration now as all the rest together.
I mean your magnificent citizenship with its grand conception, because 
there is nothing like it in the records of all mankind.  Dividing into 
two groups all those in your empire - and with this word I have 
indicated the entire civilized world - you have everywhere appointed
 to your citizenship, or even to kinship with you, the better part of the world's 
talent, courage, and leadership, while the rest yourecognized as a league under 
your hegemony.  Neither sea nor intervening continent are bars to
citizenship, nor are Asia and Europe divided in their treatment here.  
In your empire all paths are open to all.  No one worthy of rule or trust 
remains an alien, but a civil community of the World has been established
as a Free Republic under one, the best, ruler and teacher of order; and all
 come together as into a common civic center, in order to 
receive each man his due.<a href="#N_35_"><b>[[35]]</b></a></p>
<p>That being the case, it seems somewhat odd that he is best known to most people, not from
Gibbon's narrative nor from any specific scholarly treatment, but from a work of fiction.  This is
the quite splendid <em>Memoirs of Hadrian</em> by Marguerite Yourcenar, which became a best-seller
about half a century ago.  She presents a Hadrian as he might have been, and, although she
commands a wide range of source material, the reader must always be alert to the fact that this
Hadrian is not necessarily the historical Hadrian.<a href="#N_36_"><b>[[36]]</b></a></p>
<p>Scholarly work on the emperor, above all biographies, has been varied in quality.  Much the best,
as the most recent, is by A.R. Birley, who presents all that is known but underscores how much is
conjecture, nay even guesswork. We still do not really know the man.  An enigma he was to many
while alive, and so he remains for us.  <em>Semper in omnibus</em> <em>varius; omnium curiositatum
explorator; varius multiplex multiformis</em>: these are descriptions of him from antiquity.<b><a href="#N_37_">[[37]]</a></b> They
are still valid more than 1900 years after the emperor's death.</p>
