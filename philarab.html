<p>Marcus Julius Philippus rose from obscure origins to rule for
 five and one-half years as Rome's emperor. Only sketchy details of his
 life and reign have survived in the historical record. One of those
 details -- his ethnicity -- was latched onto by later historians, who 
called the emperor by the name Philip the Arab.</p> 

<h3>Background and Early Career</h3> 

<p>Philip the Arab seems to have been born sometime during
 the reign of <a href="sepsev.html"><b>Septimius Severus</b></a>.<a href="#1"><b>[[1]]</b></a> He was born in the Roman province of
 Arabia, in what today is the village of Shahba, roughly 55 miles 
south-southeast of Damascus. The village was obscure at the time of 
Philip's birth, though once he became emperor, Philip renamed the community
Philippopolis and embarked on a major building campaign.  Little is known 
of Philip's father, save the name Julius Marinus. This name, however, 
indicates that the family held Roman citizenship and must have been locally
prominent. Nothing is known of Philip's mother. At some point, probably in 
the 230s, Philip married Marcia Otacilia Severa. A son was born by 238 and
named Marcus Julius Severus Philippus.  Philip's early career is also
obscure, though it was undoubtedly helped by that of his brother, Julius 
Priscus. Priscus was appointed praetorian prefect by <a href="gordo3.html"><b>Gordian III</b></a> and had
 previously served as prefect of the Roman province of Mesopotamia. If 
a fragmentary inscription from Rome can be connected to Priscus, Philip's 
brother rose quickly during <a href="gordo3.html"><b>Gordian III's</b></a> reign through a variety of 
equestrian offices, including procurator of Macedonia, <i>vice</i> prefect
 of Egypt, and judge at Alexandria.<a href="#2"><b>[[2]]</b></a></p> 
<p>Priscus' appointment as praetorian prefect probably came at
the beginning of the Roman campaign to reconquer upper Mesopotamia in the
spring of 242. The success of the campaign must have reflected well on 
Priscus, and when his colleague Timesitheus (who was also <a href="gordo3.html"><b>Gordian III's</b></a> 
father-in-law) died the following year, Priscus' brother Philip joined him
 as praetorian prefect.<a href="#3"><b>[[3]]</b></a>  The brothers remained the young emperor's 
most powerful deputies during the disastrous campaign against the Persians
in the winter of 243-44. On the retreat back up the Euphrates after the
Roman defeat at Misikhe, <a href="gordo3.html"><b>Gordian</b></a> was killed sometime during the winter
months of 244. Most sources state that Philip was involved in <a href="gordo3.html"><b>Gordian's </b></a>
death; some claim that Philip engineered a mutiny by diverting the grain
that was supposed to feed <a href="gordo3.html"><b>Gordian's</b></a> troops.<a href="#4"><b>[[4]]</b></a></p> 

<h3>The Emperor and the Military</h3> 

<p>Philip was acclaimed the new emperor and was firmly in 
control by late winter 244.<a href="#5"><b>[[5]]</b></a> Like his predecessor Macrinus, Philip 
faced, as his first important task, the problem of ending a war in 
the East. Philip was more fortunate in his negotiations than <a href="macrinus.html"><b>Macrinus</b></a> 
had been. Philip made a peace treaty with the Persian king Shapur in 
which Philip agreed to pay the equivalent of 50 million sesterces, and 
possibly an annual tribute. The treaty enabled the new emperor to travel 
westward to Rome.<a href="#6"><b>[[6]]</b></a>  It remains unknown why Philip was displayed before 
the soldiers as their new emperor instead of his more accomplished brother
Priscus, but Priscus went on to have extraordinary power in the East during
 the new regime. Priscus is described in one inscription as <i>rector 
Orientis</i>, and he exercised supreme authority over armies and 
provinces from his headquarters in Antioch.<a href="#7"><b>[[7]]</b></a></p> 
<p>The following year the Carpi, a people native to the northern
 bank of the lower Danube, crossed the river and attacked settlements in 
the Roman province of Moesia (today, northern Bulgaria), where Philip's 
brother-in-law Severianus had been put in command.<a href="#8"><b>[[8]]</b></a> Fighting lasted 
several years and may have spread westward into Pannonia because of 
incursions by German tribes. Victory was proclaimed in 248, but the 
legions in Moesia and Pannonia were dissatisfied with the war's results. 
The armies there revolted, proclaiming <a href="philarab.htm#Note 2"><b>Tiberius Claudius Marinus 
Pacatianus</b></a> as emperor.<a href="#9"><b>[[9]]</b></a>  
While Philip could point to some success on the Danube frontier,
he could not claim victory in his battles with the Moors. The emperor preferred to pay 
for an ignominious peace rather than lose an ignominious war. 
The heavy-handedness of his brother Priscus in collecting taxes in the 
East caused another revolt, this one led by a man named <a href="philarab.htm#Note 3"><b>Iotapianus</b></a>, who 
claimed to be a kinsman of <b><a href="alexsev.html">Severus Alexander</a></b>.<a href="#10"><b>[[10]]</b></a> 
Coins that may also be 
from this period show two other men who tried to become emperors, 
<a href="philarab.htm#Note 4"><b>Silbannacus</b></a> and <a href="philarab.htm#Note 5"><b>Sponsianus</b></a>.<a href="#11"><b>[[11]]</b></a> Neither is otherwise attested, and each
 revolt must have been short-lived.</p> 
<h3>The Millennium and Christianity</h3> 
<p>Despite growing instability in the provinces, Romans in the 
year 248 were fascinated by the celebrations of the 1,000th anniversary of 
their city's foundation. The festivities may have been patterned after the
Secular Games (last held under <a href="sepsev.html"><b>Septimius Severus</b></a> 44 years earlier) and 
included magnificent spectacles for the arena.<a href="#12"><b>[[12]]</b></a> Millennarianism 
extended into the literary world, with the author Asinius Quadratus
 honoring the event by writing his <i>Thousand-Year History.</i><a href="#13"><b>[[13]]</b></a></p> 
<p>Philip's religious beliefs have garnered the most attention
 from modern historians. Writing but 75 years after Philip's reign, the 
Church father Eusebius relayed a report that Philip was a Christian who 
was once compelled by a church official to confess his sins before being 
allowed to attend an Easter service.<a href="#14"><b>[[14]]</b></a> Later sources locate the story 
in Antioch and connect the tale to Babylas, a bishop later martyred in 
the persecution mounted by Philip's successor, Decius.<a href="#15"><b>[[15]]</b></a> The Decian 
persecution is itself blamed by Eusebius on <a href="decius.html"><b>Decius'</b></a> personal hatred for 
Philip.<a href="#16"><b>[[16]]</b></a> Eusebius also reported that the Christian teacher and 
apologist Origen wrote one letter to Philip and another to Otacilia 
Severa.<a href="#17"><b>[[17]]</b></a>  While it is quite likely that Philip was well acquainted 
with Christianity and may even have been respectful of its teachings and 
leaders, he could not have been a Christian in any meaningful way. Philip 
appears indistinguishable from other third-century emperors in his use of 
pagan symbols and titles. Philip made no improvements in the legal status 
of Christians or their religion. Moreover, Philip's alleged Christianity 
was never corroborated by non-Christian authors.<a href="#18"><b>[[18]]</b></a></p> 

<p>Within six months of the beginning of his reign, <a name="Note 6"></a>Philip had 
appointed his son as Caesar and heir. Three years later, in the summer of 
247, the boy was named Augustus and co-ruler, even though he was probably 
not yet 10 years old. His mother, Otacilia Severa, is last named on coins 
in the year 248, leading to speculation that she may have died in that 
year. Nothing is known of the emperor's brother Priscus after the 
outbreak of Iotapianus' revolt: and it seems likely that he died either 
naturally or as a result of the uprising.</p> 
<h3>Defeat and Death</h3>
<p><a href="philarab.htm#Note 3"><b>Iotapianus</b></a> was eventually defeated and killed in the East, 
as was <a href="philarab.htm#Note 2"><b>Pacatianus</b></a> along the Danube.<a href="#19"><b>[[19]]</b></a> To restore discipline among the
Danubian troops, Philip sent as the new commander <a href="decius.html"><b>Decius</b></a>, a native of the 
region. The appointment proved a dangerous blunder. The disgruntled 
soldiers, still eager for decisive leadership and decisive victories, 
revolted yet again in the late spring of 249 and proclaimed <a href="decius.html"><b>Decius </b></a>
emperor.  Philip marched out from Rome to face the approaching troops of 
Decius. In late summer, the two armies met outside Verona. Philip's troops 
were bested, and the emperor either died in the battle or was assassinated 
by his troops. When news of 
Philip's defeat and death reached Rome, the praetorian guard murdered 
Philip's son and colleague.<a href="#20"><b>[[20]]</b></a></p> 

<p>Philip the Arabian remains an enigmatic figure because 
different authors evaluated his reign with wildly divergent 
interpretations. Christian authors of late antiquity praised the man they 
regarded as the first Christian emperor. Pagan historians saw Philip as 
indecisive, treacherous and weak. Our lack of detailed knowledge about 
the reign makes any analysis highly speculative. Nonetheless, 
Philip's provincial and administrative background represents continuity 
with features of Severan government. His career has its closest parallel 
with that of <a href="macrinus.html"><b>Macrinus</b></a>, an equestrian from the provinces who, a 
quarter of a century earlier, capped an administrative career by moving 
from the office of praetorian prefect to that of emperor.  In the struggle 
to maintain legitimacy, Philip faced revolts 
and upheavals in several corners of the empire. He was able to overcome 
these challenges for half a decade. The empire remained fundamentally 
sound and stable during his reign. The great disruptions of the third 
century were yet to come.</p>

<p><a name="1"></a>[[1]] The <i>Chronicon Paschale,</i> in an 
imaginative tale, claims that Philip was 45 years old at the time of his 
death in 249, which would place his birth in 204. Aurelius Victor 28.10 
writes that Philip's body was weakened by age in the year 249. One would 
expect a praetorian prefect, the office held by Philip in 243, to be at 
least in his 40s. A year of birth ca. 200 is probably not far off the 
mark.</p>

<h3>Rebellions During the reign of Phillip the Arab (244-249 
A.D.): Iotapianus, Pacatianus, Silbannacus, and Sponsianus</h3>
<center><b><p>Christian Körner</p></b></center>

<center>University of Bern</center>

<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
<p>In the ancient and Byzantine sources, several rebellions against the reign of <a href="philarab.html"><b>Philip the Arab</b></a> (A.D.
244-249) are mentioned: these include the revolts of <a href="philarab.htm#Note 3"><b>Iotapianus</b></a> in the 
Near East, and of <a href="philarab.htm#Note 2"><b>Pacatianus</b></a> and <a href="decius.html"><b>Decius</b></a> in the Danube
Area. The usurpations of <a href="philarab.htm#Note 4"><b>Mar. Silbannacus</b></a>, probably near the
Rhine frontier, and of <a href="philarab.htm#Note 5"><b>Sponsianus</b></a>, pehaps in Transylvania, are only known because of numismatic evidence.<a href="#N_21_"><b>[[1]]</b></a></p>
<p>The following essay deals separately with <a href="philarab.htm#Note 3"><b>Iotapianus</b></a>, <a href="philarab.htm#Note 2"><b>Pacatianus</b></a>, <a href="philarab.htm#Note 4"><b>Silbannacus</b></a> and <a href="philarab.htm#Note 5"><b>Sponsianus</b></a>. In
the end, there will be an attempt to compare these usurpers and to integrate them into the
historical context of the third century.<a href="#N_22_"><b>[[2]]</b></a></p>
<h3>2. Iotapianus</h3>
<a name="Note 3"></a><p>Iotapianus, known from accounts in Aurelius Victor, Zosimus and Polemius Silvius, revolted in the East
against Philip.<a href="#N_23_"><b>[[3]]</b></a> The coins which he had minted 
give his full name: M. F. Ru. Iotapianus.<a href="#N_24_"><b>[[4]]</b></a>
According to Victor, Iotapianus claimed a connection to an Alexander.  Most scholars think he was 
claiming descent from the Severan dynasty of
Emesa in Syria through <a href="alexsev.html"><b>Severus Alexander</b></a>.<a href="#N_25_"><b>[[5]]</b></a> 
However, it is also possible that the usurper claimed to be a descendant of Alexander the Great of
Macedonia: the name Iotapianus sounds similar to those  of the queens Iotape I and II of the royal house of
Commagene. The kings of Commagene, mainly Antiochus I, famous for his building on the
Nemrud Dagh, claimed descent from Alexander the Great. Therefore, Iotapianus may have
belonged to the Commagenian royal family (which had lost the throne under Vespasian).<a href="#N_26_"><b>[[6]]</b></a> In any
case, Iotapianus came from the local aristocracy of the Near East, but what position
he held when he was proclaimed emperor is unknown.  According to Zosimus, Iotapianus' rebellion was directed against the taxes raised by C. Iulius
Priscus, <a href="philarab.html"><b>Philip's</b></a> brother. Priscus was <em>rector Orientis</em> and governed several provinces in the East.<a href="#N_27_"><b>[[7]]</b></a>
It was a revolt of the provincials in Syria and Cappadocia rather than a  military usurpation (according to Victor
and to Polemius Silvius). <a href="philarab.html"><b>Philip's</b></a> reign was obviously not popular in Syria.  In one
passage of the <em>Sibylline Oracles</em>, the Syrian author shows his jealousy against the flowering of Arabia with the cities
Bostra and Philippopolis under <a href="philarab.html"><b>Philip</b></a>.<a href="#N_28_"><b>[[8]]</b></a></p>
<p>Iotapianus' revolt should be dated near the end of <a href="philarab.html"><b>Philip's</b></a> reign. The rebellion seems to have
ground to a halt while <a href="philarab.html"><b>Philip</b></a> was still emperor (Zosimus); Iotapianus himself
 was probably not put to death until <a href="decius.html"><b>Decius'</b></a> reign (Victor). The circumstances under which the rebellion ended are
unknown except for the fact that Iotapianus was killed by his own soldiers. It is unknown how
or if <a href="philarab.html"><b>Philip</b></a> reacted against the rebellion.<a href="#N_29_"><b>[[9]]</b></a> After all, Iotapianus and <a href="philarab.htm#Note 2"><b>Pacatianus</b></a> were not really a
threat to the Empire; according to Zosimus, both rebellions could be 
suppressed easily.<a href="#N_30_"><b>[[10]]</b></a>  Some coinage of Iotapianus is extant. The obverse sides show the usurper and give his full name.
The reverse sides read <em>Victoria Aug(usti)</em>, showing Victory with a wreath and a palm. Although this imagery could
refer to a victory of the rebels against <a href="philarab.html"><b>Philip's</b></a> troops, perhaps it is only propaganda claiming
"the power of the Emperor to conquer"<a href="#N_31_"><b>[[11]]</b></a>.
Iotapianus was not a military usurper like <a href="philarab.htm#Note 2"><b>Pacatianus</b></a> and <a href="decius.html"><b>Decius</b></a> and had led a rebellion of provincials against the tax policy of Rome. He can be seen as a precursor of Uranius
Antoninus of Emesa (A.D. 253) and <a href="zenobia.html"><b>Odaenathus of Palmyra</b></a> who did not plan to seize power in the entire Roman empire, but gained an
outstanding position in the East and used the title "<em>Augustus</em>" to mark this.</p>
<h3>3. Pacatianus</h3>
<a name="Note 2"></a><p>The evidence about the reign of Pacatianus is similar in nature to that
for the reign of <a href="philarab.htm#Note 3"><b>Iotapianus</b></a>: there are some small notices in the Byzantine
authors Zosimus and Zonaras as well as some coins which give his full 
name: Ti. Cl(audius) Marinus Pacatianus.<a href="#N_32_"><b>[[12]]</b></a> 
The passages in Zosimus and Zonaras show many similarities; both authors 
may have used the same source.<a href="#N_33_"><b>[[13]]</b></a>
Perhaps Pacatianus may be identified with C[l(audius) ...] Marinus, 
<em>c(larissimus) p(uer)</em>, who is mentioned, together with his father 
Cl(audius) Sollemnius Pac[atianus?], on an inscription from
Bostra.<a href="#N_34_"><b>[[14]]</b></a> According to the inscription, 
Claudius Sollemnius was governor of the province of Arabia
under Severus Alexander and later served as consular governor of 
Coele Syria .<a href="#N_35_"><b>[[15]]</b></a>  According to 
Zonaras, Pacatianus was  in the Roman army stationed on the Danube
frontier. The term can define several military ranks: military tribune, 
<em>centurio</em>, legate of a legion.<a href="#N_36_"><b>[[16]]</b></a>
Most scholars assume that Pacatianus was of senatorial rank, and may
have commanded troops of several provinces near the Danube.<a href="#N_37_"><b>[[17]]</b></a> 
Yet Zonaras also writes that Pacatianus was not worthy of ruling. 
Bleckmann deduces from this passage that the usurper cannot have been a
military commander; moreover, he notes, Zonaras uses the term  for 
officers of low rank.<a href="#N_38_"><b>[[18]]</b></a></p>
<p>No causes of the revolt are mentioned in the sources, but the Danube area
is known to have been threatened by the Goths. There was a general unrest among the troops generating several
rebellions in the region. Zosimus speaks of problems with the discipline of the army stationed on the
Danube frontier.<a href="#N_39_"><b>[[19]]</b></a>  The usurpation of Pacatianus can be dated from his coins: one coin has the reverse legend <em>Romae
Aeter(nae) an(no) mill(esimo) et primo</em>, which gives April 248 as <em>terminus post quem</em>.<a href="#N_40_"><b>[[20]]</b></a>
Pacatianus was raised to the purple by the troops of Moesia (Zosimus, Zonaras) and possibly also
of Pannonia (Zosimus). Perhaps he obtained possession of the mint of Viminacium because there were no coins of
<a href="philarab.html"><b>Philip</b></a>  apparently minted at Viminacium in the year X of the local era, i. e. A.D. 248/9.<a href="#N_41_"><b>[[21]]</b></a>
The obverse sides of Pacatianus' coins show the usurper and give his name and title (<em>Imp. Ti. Cl. Mar.
Pacatianus p. f. Aug.</em>). The reverse sides celebrate the harmony among the soldiers and the fidelity
of the troops (<em>Concordia Militum</em>, <em>Fides Militum</em>), prosperity and everlasting peace (<em>Felicitas
Publica</em>, <em>Pax Aeterna</em>), Rome's eternity (<em>Romae Aeternae anno millesimo et primo</em>), return of the
emperor (<em>Fortuna Redux</em>, perhaps an allusion to a planned march to Rome?). We find exactly the
same types also with <a href="philarab.html"><b>Philip's</b></a> coins.<a href="#N_42_"><b>[[22]]</b></a> Therefore, Pacatianus' 
coins do not show a program different from <a href="philarab.html"><b>Philip's</b></a> propaganda.</p>
<p>According to Zosimus, <a href="philarab.html"><b>Philip </b></a>was very worried about the rebellions of <a href="philarab.htm#Note 3"><b>Iotapianus</b></a> and of
Pacatianus. He spoke to the senate and offered to abdicate if the senators were not content
with him as emperor any  longer. The senator Decius predicted the breakdown of both rebellions. In fact,
Pacatianus and <a href="philarab.htm#Note 3"><b>Iotapianus</b></a> were killed by their own soldiers and, unfortunately, the sources do not 
give any explanation. Perhaps Pacatianus proved to be unsuccessful in repelling the Goths.<a href="#N_43_"><b>[[23]]</b></a> 
In any case, this description of <a href="philarab.html"><b>Philip's</b></a> panic is due to the negative picture Zosimus gives of this
emperor. Therefore, we should not accord too much credibility to the account of <a href="philarab.html"><b>Philip's</b></a> reaction.
That the emperor himself was a capable general is shown by his successful campaigns against the
Carpi earlier in his reign.</p>
<p>The rebellion of Pacatianus, like the later one of <a href="decius.html"><b>Decius</b></a>, shows that among the troops in the
Danube area there was a strong wish for the presence of the emperor with the soldiers (Castritius
and Hartmann call this "<i>Bedürfnis nach Kaisernähe</i>"<a href="#N_44_"><b>[[24]]</b></a>). 
The Danube area was the centre of several rebellions in the third century: Trebonianus Gallus, Aemilianus, 
<a href="ingen.html"><b>Ingenuus</b></a> and <a href="Regalia.html"><b>Regalianus</b></a>, to name but a few, were proclaimed emperors in this region. This shows that the soldiers wished
the emperor to be near them: firstly, this guaranteed the regular paying of the troops; secondly the
Danube region was particularly threatened by the Germans and other tribes.</p>
<h3>4. Mar. Silbannacus</h3>
<a name="Note 4"></a><p>Silbannacus is known only from one <em>antoninianus</em>, said to have been found in Lorraine. On the
basis of stylistic criteria, the coin is dated to <a href="philarab.html"><b>Philip's</b></a> reign.<a href="#N_45_"><b>[[25]]</b></a> The obverse side gives the portrait
of the emperor Silbannacus with the legend <em>Imp. Mar. Silbannacus Aug.</em> On the reverse side,
Mercury is depicted holding a Victory and a <em>caduceus</em> and the legend of the text reads 
<em>Victoria Aug</em>.  Hartmann, in his study on the usurpers of the third century, tries to reconstruct the circumstances
of the rebellion and comes to the following conclusions<a href="#N_46_"><b>[[26]]</b></a>: Silbannacus, whose name indicates
Celtic origin, revolted against Philip near the Rhine frontier in Germania Superior, which was
threatened by the German tribes. Silbannacus may well have commanded auxiliaries of other Germans
 that were serving in the Roman army. The rebellion must have ended under Decius, because Eutropius
speaks of a <em>bellum civile</em> in Gaul, suppressed by <a href="decius.html"><b>Decius</b></a>.<a href="#N_47_"><b>[[27]]</b></a></p>
<p>Hartmann's conclusions, drawn on analogy with other usurpers of the third century, are very
speculative. For example, we do not hear anything of German tribes threatening the Rhine frontier
in <a href="philarab.html"><b>Philip's</b></a> reign. Even the dating of the coin and of the usurper under <a href="philarab.html"><b>Philip</b></a> are far from certain, as
well as is the hypothesis that Silbannacus was a commander of auxiliary troops. Perhaps we can only say that Silbannacus 
may have had connections with Gaul, as the reverse side of the coin
may well show: Mercury appears to have been an eminent god in Gaul and also appears in the later coins of
<a href="postumus.html"><b>Postumus</b></a>, emperor of Gaul in the second half of the third century.<a href="#N_48_"><b>[[28]]</b></a>
Therefore we can only say, that at some date -- perhaps during the 240s --  a man named Silbannacus was proclaimed emperor in
Gaul or in one of the provinces of Germania, and that he may have been of Gallic origin.</p>
<h3>5. Sponsianus</h3>
<a name="Note 5"></a><p>Sponsianus is known from very mysterious <em>aurei</em>, found in Transylvania in 1713.<a href="#N_49_"><b>[[29]]</b></a> 
Because coins of <a href="philarab.html"><b>Philip</b></a> and <a href="gordo3.html"><b>Gordian III</b></a> were found in the same context, Sponsianus is believed to have been
proclaimed emperor in the forties of the third century.  The main problem is the reverse side of Sponsianus' coins, which is identical with a republican
reverse of the Minucii from the second century B.C.  Hartmann deduces from this reverse
side that Sponsianus may have been the leader of a "senatorial resistance" against <a href="philarab.html"><b>Philip</b></a> and
therefore minted a republican reverse side.<a href="#N_50_"><b>[[30]]</b></a> This hypothesis is totally unfounded: if there existed
something like a "senatorial resistance" against <a href="philarab.html"><b>Philip</b></a>, they would not have minted coins with a rare
republican reverse side which was of interest only for the members of the republican <em>gens Minucia</em>
which undoubtedly had died out long ago; the coins of a  "senatorial resistance" would
probably show types referring to the emperors <a href="balbinus.html"><b>Balbinus</b></a> and <a href="pupienus.html"><b>Pupienus</b></a> elected by the senate in
A.D. 238. Furthermore, no senator really thought of returning to the days of the republic. (Most
republican senatorial families had died out already in the first century A.D.<a href="#N_51_"><b>[[31]]</b></a>)</p>
<p algn="left">In the last century, Cohen declared the coins to be modern forgeries of very poor quality.<a href="#N_52_"><b>[[52]]</b></a> In any
case, a hybrid coin, be it a modern forgery or a barbarous coin of late antiquity, is
not strong enough evidence  to base any conclusions upon.</p>
<h3>6. Conclusions</h3>
<p>Toward the end of <a href="philarab.html"><b>Philip's</b></a> reign there were three or perhaps four rebellions:
those of <a href="philarab.htm#Note 3"><b>Iotapianus</b></a> in the East, <a href="philarab.htm#Note 2"><b>Pacatianus</b></a> and <a href="decius.html"><b>Decius</b></a> in the Danubian provinces, and perhaps <a href="philarab.htm#Note 4"><b>Silbannacus</b></a> near
the Rhine frontier.<a href="#N_53_"><b>[[33]]</b></a> The three usurpers we know better fit well into the context of the third
century. Their rebellions reveal the two main problems of the third century: (1) the invasions of
the tribes from outside the empire caused unrest among the troops who had to protect the
frontiers, and (2), the economic and financial crisis caused the emperors to raise high taxes among the
provincials.   Concerning their origin, all three came from the "upper-classes": <a href="decius.html"><b>Decius</b></a> was a senator, <a href="philarab.htm#Note 2"><b>Pacatianus</b></a>
probably came from senatorial stock, while <a href="philarab.htm#Note 3"><b>Iotapianus</b></a> came from the local elite in the East. Until the
reign of <a href="gallval.html"><b>Gallienus </b></a>(253-268), almost every usurper had a senatorial background.<a href="#N_54_"><b>[[34]]</b></a></p>
<p><a href="decius.html"><b>Decius</b></a> and <a href="philarab.htm#Note 2"><b>Pacatianus</b></a> were proclaimed emperor by the army and owed this to their military rank.
This shows the crucial role the army (especially the troops stationed near the Danube) played in
the crisis of the third century. This development is due to the fact that the frontier was threatened
by the Germans and other tribes, and that the soldiers wanted their emperors to be near them.
<a href="philarab.htm#Note 3"><b>Iotapianus</b></a>, on the other hand, was the leader of an uprising of the Eastern provincials who felt that
the government did not regard their interests sufficiently. <a href="philarab.html"><b>Philip</b></a> needed cash during his reign: he, for example,
had to pay the Persians for the peace at the beginning of his reign, he launched the building of his
hometown in Arabia, Philippopolis, and the celebration of the thousandth anniversary of Rome was
certainly very expensive.  The more mundane costs of paying the troops have not even been taken into account.</p>
<p>All three rebellions also show the charisma the Roman emperors had won in the eyes of the
soldiers and of the provincials during the preceding two and a half centuries: by electing an emperor
who was near them, they hoped that security (or victory in the case of the soldiers) and economic
stability would be guaranteed.  The revolts of <a href="philarab.htm#Note 3"><b>Pacatianus</b></a> and of <a href="philarab.htm#Note 2"><b>Iotapianus</b></a> soon broke down. Both had lost their
charisma, maybe as a result of military defeat. <a href="decius.html"><b>Decius</b></a> on the other side succeeded when he
defeated <a href="philarab.html"><b>Philip</b></a> in A.D. 249 in the battle of Verona. </p>

<p><a name="N_21_"></a>[[1]] In addition, Byzantine sources (mainly Zonaras 12,18) mention also two emperors elected by the senate in Rome
A.D. 244, after Gordian III was killed at the Euphrates and while Philip was still in the East: Marcus Philosophus
and Severus Hostilianus. They are distortions of the Byzantine tradition, Marcus being a confusion with <strong>Marcus</strong>
Aurelius, known for his philosophical interests, and maybe with <strong>Marcus</strong> Iulius Philippus (Philip the Arab),
Severus Hostilianus being a contamination of the names of Severus and of Decius' younger son Hostilianus.

(against the latter's own will) to the Danubian troops to put things in order. The soldiers who had supported
Pacatianus prevented punishment by proclaiming Decius emperor. (See Zosimus and Zonaras)
