<p><b><span class="text-2xl">Augustus' Military Achievements</span></b>
</p><p><b>Herbert W. Benario</b>
</p><p><b>Emory University</b></p></center>

<p>When the struggle against Antony and Cleopatra ended, Octavian found
himself commander of some 60-70 legions and 900 warships. The Roman state
could not, as a matter of course, support such a military establishment,
nor was it politic to have so many men in service. He therefore discharged
the majority, reducing the number of legions to 26; with the annexation
of Galatia in 25 B.C., two new legions were added. The loss of three under
Varus (see below) left only 25. There were thus about 150,000 legionaries,
with an equivalent number of auxiliaries. The navy had two main bases,
Misenum on the Bay of Naples and Ravenna along the Adriatic coast, with
smaller flotillas elsewhere, such as at Forum Julii in southern France.
</p><p>Attendant upon the emperor were the nine cohorts of the Praetorian Guard.In
the later years of Augustus' principate, seven cohorts of <i>vigiles</i><u>,</u>
who served as police in Rome, were established. There were also three <i>cohortes
urbanae.&nbsp; </i>In the <i>Res Gestae</i>, his final statement of his
activities and expenditures for the Roman state, Augustus spoke frequently
of his military achievements. The text was inscribed on two bronze tablets
placed in front of his mausoleum, in the Campus Martius in Rome. There
survive copies from three places in Galatia, both in the Latin original
and a Greek paraphrase on the walls of the pronaos of the temple of Rome
and Augustus in Ankara, the Latin text from Antioch, the Greek from Apollonia
in Pisidia. The military passages follow.
</p><p>"4 I celebrated two ovations and three curule triumphs and I was twenty-one
times saluted as <i>imperator</i>. The senate decreed still more triumphs
to me, all of which I declined. I laid the bay leaves with which my <i>fasces</i>
were wreathed in the Capitol after fulfilling all the vows which I had
made in each war. On fifty-five occasions the senate decreed that thanksgivings
should be offered to the immortal gods on account of the successes on land
and sea gained by me and by my legates acting under my auspices. The days
on which thanksgivings were offered in accordance with decrees of the senate
numbered eight hundred and ninety. In my triumphs nine kings or children
of kings were led before my chariot.
</p><p>13 It was the will of our ancestors that the gateway of Janus Quirinus
should be shut when victories had secured peace by land and sea and throughout
the whole empire of the Roman people; from the foundation of the city down
to my birth, tradition records that it was shut only twice, but while I
was the leading citizen the senate resolved that it should be shut on three
occasions.
</p><p>26 I extended the territory of all those provinces of the Roman people
on whose borders lay peoples not subject to our government. I brought peace
to the Gallic and Spanish provinces as well as to Germany, throughout the
area bordering on the Ocean from Cadiz to the mouth of the Elbe. I secured
the pacification of the Alps from the district nearest the Adriatic to
the Tuscan sea, yet without waging an unjust war on any people. My fleet
sailed through the Ocean eastwards from the mouth of the Rhine to the territory
of the Cimbri, a country which no Roman had visited before either by land
or sea, and the Cimbri, Charydes, Semnones and other German peoples of
that region sent ambassadors and sought my friendship and that of the Roman
people. At my command and under my auspices two armies were led almost
at the same time into Ethiopia and Arabia Felix; vast enemy forces of both
peoples were cut down in battle and many towns captured. Ethiopia was penetrated
as far as the town of Nabata, which adjoins Meroë: in Arabia the army
advanced into the territory of the Sabaeans to the town of Mariba.
</p><p>27 I added Egypt to the empire of the Roman people. Greater Armenia
I might have made a province after its king, Artaxes, had been killed,
but I preferred, following the model set by our ancestors, to hand over
that kingdom to Tigranes, son of Artavasdes and grandson of king Tigranes;
Tiberius Nero, who was then my stepson, carried this out. When the same
people later rebelled and went to war, I subdued them through the agency
of my son Gaius and handed them over to be ruled by King Ariobarzanes,
son of Artabazus King of the Medes, and after his death to his son Artavasdes.
When he was killed, I sent Tigranes, a scion of the royal Armenian house,
to that kingdom. I recovered all the provinces beyond the Adriatic Sea
towards the east, together with Cyrene, the greater part of them being
then occupied by kings. I had previously recovered Sicily and Sardinia
which had been seized in the slave war.
</p><p>28 I founded colonies of soldiers in Africa, Sicily, Macedonia, both
Spanish provinces, Achaea, Asia, Syria, Gallia Narbonensis and Pisidia.
Italy too has twenty-eight colonies founded by my authority, which were
densely populated in my lifetime.
</p><p>29 By victories over enemies I recovered in Spain and Gaul, and from
the Dalmatians several standards lost by other commanders. I compelled
the Parthians to restore to me the spoils and standards of three Roman
armies and to ask as suppliants for the friendship of the Roman people.
These standards I deposited in the innermost shrine of the temple of Mars
the Avenger.
</p><p>30 The Pannonian peoples, whom the army of the Roman people never approached
before I was the leading citizen, were conquered through the agency of
Tiberius Nero, who was then my stepson and legate; I brought them into
the empire of the Roman people, and extended the frontier of Illyricum
to the banks of the Danube. When an army of Dacians crossed the Danube,
it was defeated and routed under my auspices, and later my army crossed
the Danube and compelled the Dacian peoples to submit to the commands of
the Roman people. "
</p><p>(tr. Brunt and Moore)
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>The crucial section for understanding his "constitutional" position
is 34. His military capabilities rested upon his unique status, at least
partially indicated here.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>"34 In my sixth and seventh consulships (28-27 B.C.), after I had extinguished
civil wars, and at a time when with universal consent I was in complete
control of affairs, I transferred the republic from my power to the dominion
of the senate and people of Rome .After this time I excelled all in influence
(<i>auctoritas</i><u>)</u>, although I possessed no more official power
(<i>potestas</i>) than others who were my colleagues in the several magistracies.
"
</p><p>(tr. Brunt and Moore)
</p><p>Augustus names in the <i>Res Gestae</i> the provinces which he added
to the empire. The list is very extensive, yet, since direct comparison
with the achievements of any earlier <i>imperator</i> is omitted, the reader
may not have realized that he brought more territory within the dominion
of the Roman state than any other: Egypt, northern Spain, the Alpine lands,
Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia, Moesia, Galatia, Paphlagonia, and part of Pontus.
He thereby freed Italy from incursions by the Alpine tribes and extended
the northern frontier of the empire to the Danube. His military conquests
lacked the spectacular elements of those of Pompey the Great and Julius
Caesar, who, respectively, settled the affairs of the East in the late
sixties and conquered Gaul in the fifties. The accession of Egypt alone
would have excited the spirit of the Roman people in similar fashion, yet
that rich land fell into Augustus' hands essentially by default rather
than as a result of major victories on the battlefield. Only in Spain and
Illyricum did Augustus participate in sustained military operations.
</p><p>Nor does Augustus clearly indicate where his expansionist policy met
obstacles. The campaigns in Arabia and Ethiopia were both checked. The
Parthians, who had defeated Roman armies and captured standards in 53,
40, and 36 B.C., were not attacked but were persuaded to return the standards
of Crassus (53) in 20 B.C. This event was immortalized on the cuirass of
the statue of Augustus from Prima Porta and commemorated by a triple arch
to Augustus in the Roman forum which replaced a simpler, smaller one of
a decade earlier. This rapprochement with the Parthians represented his
most substantial diplomatic achievement, secured Rome's eastern frontiers,
and spared her the enormous expense of a major war at a great distance
from the Mediterranean center.
</p><p>There was great public outcry for the conquest of Britain (so Horace,
at least, leads us to believe) but Augustus chose not to invade the island.
His aggressive foreign policy was most vividly displayed in Germany, where
campaigns over a span of some twenty years ultimately came to a disastrous
end when Arminius, a chieftain of the tribe of the Cherusci, himself a
Roman citizen and former auxiliary officer, ambushed the legate Publius
Quinctilius Varus and his three legions, XVII, XVIII, and XIX, in the Teutoburg
Forest in 9 A.D. and annihilated practically the entire army. Varus committed
suicide on the field of battle and the three legionary numbers were never
used again. An earlier setback suffered by Lollius had proven only a minor
impediment; Varus' disaster ended Roman hopes of conquering free Germany
as far as the river Elbe. Its impact upon Augustus is best exemplified
by the aged emperor's response; for months afterwards, he would often bang
his head against a door and cry out, "Varus, give me back my legions" (<i>Quintili
Vare, legiones redde</i> [Suetonius, <i>Augustus</i> 23]). Arminius' victory
was the most devastating that Rome had yet suffered. Even the disasters
at the hands of the Samnites and of Hannibal had only delayed the ultimate
Roman triumph. This was also the case with the invasions of the Cimbri
and Teutons toward the end of the second century B.C. In the course of
about a decade, they destroyed five consular armies, but before long Marius
conquered them in separate battles. Arminius' destruction of much of the
army's offensive capacity was responsible for a major change in Roman policy,
and the Elbe never became Rome's northeastern frontier. Moreover, the collapse
of Augustus' dream in Germany followed hard upon a bitter and desperate
uprising in Dalmatia and Pannonia, which lasted three years (6-9 A.D.)
and was crushed by Tiberius in extremely hard fighting.
</p><p>Augustus was not himself a great commander, although in the Illyrian
campaigns of 35-33 B.C. he proved to be a capable and brave soldier who
fit into the tradition of the "old Roman general." He early recognized
his own shortcomings and was fortunate to have friends and relatives upon
whom he could call to lead the great military enterprises. Among his boyhood
companions were Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and Quintus Salvidienus Rufus.
Agrippa remained his closest friend and associate, faithful to the end,
as well as becoming his son-in-law. Salvidienus proved unreliable, suspected
of negotiations with Antony, and was executed in 40 B.C. His place in the
counsels of the young Caesar was taken by Titus Statilius Taurus, who gained
two consulates and served as prefect of the city. Augustus' stepsons Tiberius
and Drusus gained great renown, with much hard fighting, in Germany and
Pannonia. After Drusus' death in 9 B.C., Tiberius was Rome's prime general,
his greatest achievement the crushing of the Pannonian Revolt in 6-9 A.D.
</p><p>Augustus' expansionist policy was accomplished by a very small army.
Ultimately the Rhine and the Danube frontiers were particularly strongly
garrisoned. Permanent encampments began to be built. In Germany, along
the lower and middle Rhine, there were six (from north to south): Fectio
(Vechten), Noviomagus (Nijmegen), Vetera, Novaesium (Neuss), Oppidum Ubiorum
(Cologne), and Moguntiacum (Mainz).The prime base along the Danube was
Carnuntum, in eastern Austria.
</p><p>During the civil wars, soldiers had frequently served very long periods.
Discharge, care of veterans, and regularizing terms of service were important
matters to which Augustus gave great attention and, as he reports in the
<i>Res
Gestae</i>, these activities involved enormous expenses.
</p><p>"3 The Roman citizens who took the soldiers' oath of obedience to me
numbered about 500,000. I settled rather more than 300,000 of these in
colonies or sent them back to their home towns after their period of service;
to all these I assigned lands or gave money as rewards for their military
service.
</p><p>16 I paid cash to the towns for the lands that I assigned to soldiers
in my fourth consulship (30 B.C.), and later in the consulship of Marcus
Crassus and Gnaeus Lentulus (14 B.C.). The sum amounted to about 600,000,000
sesterces paid for lands in Italy, and about 260,000,000 disbursed for
provincial lands. Of all those who founded military colonies in Italy or
the provinces I was the first and only one to have done this in the recollection
of my contemporaries. Later I paid monetary rewards to soldiers whom I
settled in their home towns after completion of their service, and on this
account I expended about 400,000,000 sesterces."
</p><p>(tr. Brunt and Moore)
</p><p>When the number of legions was reduced to 26, the term of service was
set at sixteen years, while auxiliaries served twenty. In 5 A.D., Augustus
ceased settling veterans in colonies or any other specified places and
gave each man a discharge bonus of 12,000 sesterces, a sum equivalent to
twelve years' pay. Even the seemingly infinite resources of the <i>princeps</i>
were incapable of meeting such an obligation regularly. As a result, in
the following year, terms of service were lengthened (legionaries to twenty
years, auxiliaries to twenty-five) to reduce the immediate requirements
of bonuses and the <i>aerarium militare</i> (military treasury) was established.
It was now the state's responsibility, rather than his own, to reward legionaries
for faithful service. Augustus gave an initial gift to the
<i>aerarium
militare </i>of 170,000,000 sesterces (<i>RG</i> 17); thereafter it was
funded by a five per cent duty on inheritances (the <i>vicesima hereditatum</i>)
and a one per cent duty on auction sales (the <i>centesima rerum venalium</i>).
Auxiliaries received citizenship upon discharge.
