<h3>Marcian (450-457 A.D.)</h3>

</p><p><strong>Early Life and Accession</strong></p>



<p>Relatively little is known about Marcian before his accession to the throne.  He was most probably

an Illyrian by birth, although one source claims that he was a Thracian.  Born in 392, he, like many

other public men from that region, made his career in the military.  His father had been a soldier

and Marcian first served in the city of Philippopolis in Thrace.  From there, Marcian as a tribune

went with his unit to fight the Persians in 421-2, but he apparently became ill in Lycia and

never saw action in the campaign.  </p>



<p>From this relatively inauspicious beginning, he served as personal assistant (<em>domesticus</em>) to the

emperor's commander-in-chief (<em>magister utriusque militiae</em>), Aspar.  This placed Marcian in the

highest military circles, but certainly did not provide him with any singular distinction.  In the early

430's, he served with Aspar in Africa and was apparently captured by the Vandals.  In one fanciful

story, no doubt a creation of later writers, Marcian supposedly met the Vandal king, Gaiseric, who

predicted that he would one day be emperor.  After his capture, we know no more of his career

before his accession to the throne in 450.</p>





<p>With the death of <a href="theo2.html"><b>Theodosius II</b></a> under somewhat mysterious circumstances, the imperial

succession was thrown open to question for the first time in over 60 years.  <a href="theo2.html"><b>Theodosius</b></a> had left no

available heir:  his one surviving child, <a href="eudox.html"><b>Licinia Eudoxia</b></a>, had married <a href="valeniii.html"><b>Valentinian III</b></a>.  According to

a seventh century source, the emperor on his deathbed willed Marcian to be his heir, but this story

was almost assuredly a product of propaganda after the event.  Whatever the case, Aspar

engineered his candidacy with the agreement of <a href="theo2.html"><b>Theodosius'</b></a> sister, Pulcheria Augusta, who

married the former tribune.  With the support of the last representative of the Theodosian house in

the east and the head general, Marcian received the support of the Senate and the armies.  On

August 25, 450, Pulcheria herself gave him the imperial diadem, an unique event implying that an

Augusta shared in the imperial power.  In return, Marcian swore to respect her virginity and be a

staunch champion of religious orthodoxy.  That Pulcheria's virginity remained intact indicates the

political nature of this marriage.  Quickly thereafter, he had his only daughter, Aelia Marcia

Euphemia, marry the future western emperor, <a href="anthemiu.html"><b>Anthemius</b></a>.</p>





<p><strong>Religious Policies</strong></p>



<p>Shortly after his accession, Marcian called the Fourth Ecumenical Council at Chalcedon, held in

late 451.  Bishops and their representatives wrestled with the religious controversies surrounding

the beliefs of Nestorius, Eutyches and other monophysite thinkers who questioned the nature of

Christ.  The assembled  orthodox clerics condemned monophysitism outright, holding to the belief that

Christ had one nature, both human and divine.  Marcian had pushed to the fore the views of Pope

Leo (from the so-called <i>Tome</i> of Leo), no doubt hoping that the bishop of Rome would in turn

support his reign with <a href="Valeniii.html"><b>Valentinian III</b></a> (Valentinian gave only lukewarm recognition to his imperial

colleague).  Whatever the rationale behind his support, the western--that is, papal--position was

forwarded and declared orthodox by the council.  </p>





<p>Nor was the emperor afraid to back up the council's decision. When Palestinian monks rose in

revolt in 453, Marcian sent troops on a regular campaign to quell the insurrection.  He also

insured the installation of the new archbishop, Proterius, in Alexandria after similar violence in

that city.</p>





<p>The council at Chalcedon was also important because it more clearly outlined the increasing split

between east and west.  Pope Leo's legates had been the only western representatives at a

supposedly ecumenical council, signifying the degree to which the west was distracted by its own

religious and political concerns.  The council had also passed a canon over the objections of Leo

which gave the archbishop at Constantinople official oversight over the whole east.  This would

prove a key sticking point in later years and helped to separate the two halves of Christendom.</p>





<p>In addition to the Fourth Ecumenical Council, Marcian also supported his wife's extensive

building projects until her death in July of 453.  Unsurprisingly, they were all churches and

Pulcheria did much to further the mother of God (<em>theotokos</em>) cult.  </p>





<p><strong>Political and Military Policies</strong></p>



<p>Marcian's reign began with an immediate change in policy toward Attila and the Huns.  In the last years of

<a href="theo2.html"><b>Theodosius II</b></a>, the chamberlain and guardian (<em>spatharius</em>), Chrysaphius, had largely been the

architect of appeasement in regards to the Hunnic confederation, paying out huge indemnities as

safeguards against potential attack.  Shortly after Marcian's coronation, Chrysaphius was either

murdered or executed, and the new emperor refused to pay any more subsidies.  </p>





<p>Marcian's decision had been ill-conceived, but as it turned out, it was enormously successful.  The

senatorial aristocracy, which had been strongly opposed to treating with barbarians, heartily

supported this action.  More importantly, Attila became too absorbed in western imperial politics

to deal with the recalcitrant Marcian, although the Huns may have also thought that the western

court was an easier target to bully and extort money from.  And before Attila could refocus his attention on the

east, he died and his empire disintegrated.  The emperor quickly formed alliances with those

peoples previously under Hunnic domination, especially the Ostrogoths, to thwart their re-emergence. Indeed, the emperor even permitted these peoples to settle as federates in Pannonia,

Thrace and Illyricum.  Marcian's policy also resulted in saving the imperial treasury enormous

sums:  at the end of his reign, Marcian left his successor 100,000 pounds of gold.</p>


<p>Little other military action happened during his tenure, although there were some campaigns

against Saracens in Syria and against the Blemmyes in Egypt.  The lack of any long-term, large-scale wars with the Persians, Huns or others also meant that the emperor was able to amass more

funds than might otherwise have occurred.  But it seems, too, that the emperor tried to avoid

confrontation:  the assassination of <a href="Valeniii.html"><b>Valentinian III</b></a> and the subsequent Vandal sack of Rome in

455 was met with muted silence from the east.  The emperor contented himself with sending an

embassy to Gaiseric requesting the return of the empress, <a href="eudox.html"><b>Eudoxia</b></a>, and her daughters.</p>


<p>Marcian did remain largely beholden to Aspar, however.  Perhaps because of his support, Marcian

made the general a patrician.  The emperor also appointed his son, Ardabur, the commander-in-chief for the East (<em>magister utriusque militiae per Orientem</em>) and perhaps made him a patrician as

well.  It is difficult to tell whether they dictated policy, but it seems that if they did, Aspar and his

son were for the most part careful not to step on the political toes of Constantinople's ruling class. 

Despite the general's power, there was still a strong anti-Germanic sentiment among the

aristocracy.</p>


<p>Towards the end of his reign in 456, Marcian heavily censured the Greens throughout the Eastern

Roman Empire, one of the two circus factions continually at war with one another.  When they

showed their displeasure at the emperor's patronage of the Blues, he forbade the Greens from

holding any administrative or public posts for three years.  Since Chrysaphius had favored the

Greens, these actions may have had a dynastic aspect to them.  </p>





<p><strong>Financial and Legal Reforms</strong></p>



<p>Most of Marcian's financial policies were designed to placate the senatorial aristocracy and in

those policies, he was also very successful.  The one tax upon senatorial wealth, the <em>collatio

glebalis</em>, was abolished, more easily accomplished since the emperor no longer subsidized the

Huns.  Of equal importance to the senatorial elite, Marcian ended many of the financial obligations

owed by holders of the old republican offices.  Praetors and consuls normally had to put on large

public games, the latter also having to distribute wealth to the general public of Constantinople. 

Now only the highest-ranking senators, the <em>illustres</em>, were eligible to serve in these offices and

they were not required to spend the huge sums of money that had been traditionally associated

with holding them.  The financial windfall for the aristocracy was great and since it had previously

gone to public entertainments instead of imperial coffers, the emperor could easily afford such

munificence.</p>





<p>Marcian did try to address other financial issues, too.  Upon his accession, he proclaimed a

remission of all old monies owed to the state.  Again, this probably benefited the wealthier classes,

but it certainly spread to a much broader spectrum of imperial society.  Of equal importance was a

campaign against the sale of governmental offices.  The fact that the emperor <a href="anastasi.html"><b>Anastasius</b></a> and

others also tried to halt this practice demonstrates the endemic nature of the problem. 

Nevertheless, his attempt was a recognition of a corrupt custom that led to other corruptions.</p>



<p>His legal record is much less clear, although a few of his enactments survive.  Perhaps his most

significant was a law rescinding a previous law of the emperor <a href="https://www.salve.edu/~dimaiom/conniei.html"><b>Constantine</b></a>, which had in turn

been an extension of an Augustan law.  Whereas it had been previously illegal for a member of the

senatorial class to marry a freeborn poor woman (<em>humilis</em>), Marcian now permitted such a match

assuming that the lady in question was of good moral character.  It was significant law not only in

itself, but also to a future law of the emperor <a href="justin.html"><b>Justin</b></a> in the 520's, which allowed senators and other

lowborn women (<em>infames</em>) to marry:  that law permitted <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> and <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a> to wed.  Whether

Marcian's decree was in reaction to a specific case, however, is unknown.</p>



<p><strong>Death and Assessment</strong></p>



<p>In January of 457, Marcian died at the age of 65, supposedly of gangrene in the feet.  Legend has

it that he was also on a long religious procession on the eve of his death.  The emperor was buried

in the Church of the Apostles next to his wife, Pulcheria.  Despite the fact that he had married his

daughter to <a href="anthemiu.html"><b>Anthemius</b></a>, she had no Theodosian connection and hence lacked even the legitimacy

that Marcian had gained through marriage. <a href="anthemiu.html"><b> Anthemius</b></a> did not succeed his father-in-law.</p>





<p>Later Byzantine writers looked back at Marcian's reign as something of a golden age.  He had

secured the political and financial security of the east, had established the orthodox line that future

emperors would support, and had achieved a fair amount of political harmony and stability within

the capital city.  These things were all real, but much of his success must also be accorded to luck. 

The Persians and Huns were absorbed with other matters, no great natural disasters had crippled

the resources of the government, and he was fortunate that there was a representative of the house

of <a href="theo2.html"><b>Theodosius</b></a> to validate his position.  It is also clear that he steadfastly remained out of

entanglements with the west.  In that sense, Marcian's rule was the conceptual end of a

universal--and unified--Roman Empire.</p>



<p><strong>Sources and Bibliography</strong></p>



<p>No true comprehensive descriptions of Marcian's life or reign survive.  The <em>Ecclesiastical History</em>

(<em>Historia Ecclesiastica</em>) of Evagrius offers some  important details of his early life, as does the

<em>Chronographia</em> of Theophanes.  The decisions of the Council of Chalcedon can be found in the

official <em>Acta</em> (E. Schwartz <em>et al. </em>eds., <em>Acta Conciliorum Oecumenicorum</em> v. 2 [1932-8]).  For the

rest of his reign, the <em>Chronicon Paschale</em>, the chronicles of Marcellinus <em>comes</em>, the <em>Lexicon </em>of

Suidas, the <em>Chronographia</em> of John Malalas, and the fragmented history of Priscus are all valuable

sources.  John Lydus' <em>Magistracies of the Roman People</em> (<em>De magistratibus populi Romani</em>) also

offers important information about the state's finances.  Several laws survive:  <em>CJ</em>  i:39:2, xii:2:2,

xii:3:2, and several <em>novellae</em>.</p>
