<h3>
<b>Nicephorus I A. D. 802-811</b></h3></center>

<center><b>Matthew Marsh</b>
<br>Sul Ross State University</center>

<p>Nicephorus I can be considered one of the Byzantine Empire's more controversial
emperors, reigning in a period more turbulent than usual. Nicephorus' policies,
which were aimed at strengthening the Byzantine State, were viewed extremely
critically by Theophanes, the main chronicler for the period. Theophanes
objected strongly to Nicephorus' tolerance towards the iconoclasts, his
desire to make the church subordinate to the state once again, and his
financial policies which affected the church. This would lead to Nicephorus
having an unflattering and frequently unfair portrayal in the historical
record of the time. Since Theophanes was the main chronicler working during
this period, and the one whose work is the most intact, his viewpoint has
tended to dominate the historical record, despite the more favorable, but
fragmented accounts in the <i>Chronicle of Monemvasia</i> and the non-Byzantine
sources such as Bar Hebraeus and Michael the Syrian. Additionally, the
<i>Chronicle
of 811</i> offers a more grounded critique of his military abilities and
his final campaign. Early modern historians such as Edward Gibbon, and
even to a degree George Finley, accepted Theophanes' account at face value,
leading to a rather negative view of Nicephorus. In the late nineteenth
century Charles W. C. Oman, in his popular history of the Byzantine Empire
and later in his history of the Dark Ages, gave one of the first balanced
accounts of Nicephorus' reign. However, due to the vast span of history
to be covered, Oman was only able to devote a few paragraphs to his reign.
Beginning with J. B. Bury in his <i>History of the Eastern Roman Empire</i>,
and Charles Diehl with his contribution to the original
<i>Cambridge Medieval
History</i>, other historians have re-examined the evidence and have discovered
instead a farsighted, but flawed ruler who laid the foundation for the
Byzantine Empire's prosperity in the Macedonian period.<b><a href="#N_1_">[[1]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<h3>
Background and Early Career</h3></center>
According to tradition, Nicephorus was descended from one of the last Ghassanid
Kings, Gafna or Djabalah or Cabella depending on what source is used, who
along with his family had fled to Roman-controlled Cappadocia during the
early days of the Moslem conquest of the Levant.<b><a href="#N_2_">[[2]]</a></b>&nbsp;
However, this tradition is only to be found in non-Byzantine sources since
Theophanes only records that the Emperor was a close neighbor of the Athinganoi
in Phrygia and Lycaonia; the chronographer's comments describe Cappadocia,
although they do not answer the question of his ancestry.<b><a href="#N_3_">[[3]]</a></b>&nbsp;
Perhaps one can safely say Nicephorus' ancestors were Arab Christians,
not necessarily royalty, who left Mesopotamia before the Arab conquest
and settled in Cappadocia. From his origins in Cappadocia Nicephorus had
risen in the early days of<b><a href="irene.html"> Irene's </a></b>regency
through the ranks to become the strategos of the Armeniac Theme.<b><a href="#N_4_">[[4]]&nbsp;</a></b>
In this position he had supported <b><a href="irene.html">Irene</a></b>
when<b><a href="irene.html"> Constantine VI</a></b> moved to become sole
ruler of the Empire in A. D. 790, though his troops mutinied and removed
him from command.<b><a href="#N_5_">[[5]]</a></b> Sometime between A. D.
790 and 797 Nicephorus became the Chief Logothete or Finance Minister for
<b><a href="irene.html">Irene. </a></b>In this capacity Nicephorus had overseen
the fiscal administration of the Empire, an experience which would serve
him well during his reign as Emperor.<b><a href="#N_6_">[[6]]</a></b>&nbsp;
At the time of his <i>coup d'état</i> Nicephorus was about fifty
and widowed, as his wife, who was possibly named Procopria, is not named
in the listing of Imperial tombs. Nicephorus had two living children, a
daughter Procopria, and a son Stauracius. Procopria was married to the
future emperor <b><a href="mikeI.html">Michael Rhangabe</a></b> and already
had children of her own when Nicephorus became Emperor. His son <b><a href="stauric.html">Stauracius
</a></b>was evidently only about ten when Nicephorus became Emperor and,
due to his youth, would not play a large role in the government, despite
having been crowned co-Emperor, until the very end of Nicephorus' reign.<b><a href="#N_7_">[[7]]</a></b>
<center>
<h3>
The Empire in A. D. 802</h3></center>
In A. D. 802 the Byzantine Empire, while not permanently damaged, was in
a weaker position than it had been in A. D.780 on the death of <b><a href="constanv.html">Constantine
V.</a></b> The struggle for power between <b><a href="irene.html">Constantine
VI</a></b> and his mother <b><a href="irene.html">Irene</a></b> had led
to greater involvement of the Thematic commanders in the politics of the
Empire, making them more likely to mutiny or revolt. This is particularly
evident in the period from 790-797 when there were no less than four revolts
led by the Thematic commanders. Additionally, the empire's financial position
was not good since <b><a href="irene.html">Irene</a></b> had practically
let the taxes owed by monastic properties lapse during her reign, and given
tax breaks to the merchants to encourage them to support her in Constantinople.
In foreign affairs the Empire had suffered as well. The Bulgars, whom <b><a href="constanv.html">Constantine
V </a></b>had defeated repeatedly during his reign, had regrouped and sharply
defeated the Imperial forces. The Arab Caliphate had repeatedly made raids
into Byzantine Anatolia during <b><a href="irene.html">Irene's </a></b>regency
and, while no major territory had been lost, these raids, coupled with
the defeats inflicted by the Bulgarians, made the Empire seem like it was
weakening and disorganized. To add insult to injury, on Christmas Day in
A. D. 800 the Frankish King Charlemagne was crowned Emperor of the Romans
by Pope Leo III, contributing further to the declining international prestige
of the Empire.<b><a href="#N_8_">[[8]]</a></b>
<center>
<h3>
The
<i>coup d'état</i> against Irene</h3></center>
By A. D. 802 <b><a href="irene.html">Irene's</a></b> hold on power was slipping
rapidly and on the night of October 31 a group of senior patricians, bureaucratic
officials and officers of the tagmata moved to overthrow <b><a href="irene.html">Irene
</a></b>and set up Nicephorus in her place. The conspirators gained entrance
into the palace by convincing the guards that <b><a href="irene.html">Irene</a></b>
had sent them to proclaim Nicephorus Emperor because the patrician Aetius
was going to force <b><a href="irene.html">Irene</a></b> to name his brother
Leo as Emperor in her stead. Once in the palace they sent runners out to
proclaim the ascension of Nicephorus, and they surrounded the monastery
where <b><a href="irene.html">Irene</a></b> was with troops; having arrested
her, they brought her to the Great Palace under guard. With Irene out of
the way, the conspirators then had Nicephorus crowned in the Hagia Sophia
by the Patriarch Tarasius.<b><a href="#N_9_">[[9]]</a></b>
<br>After his coronation Nicephorus met with <b><a href="irene.html">Irene</a></b>,
who recognized Nicephorus as emperor. Nicephorus allowed <b><a href="irene.html">Irene
</a></b>to stay in the Palace of Eleutherius in return for revealing where
she had hidden most of the Imperial treasury. However, even though <b><a href="irene.html">Irene</a></b>
had revealed the location of the treasury, she was too dangerous to be
allowed free reign of the capital. According to some sources <b><a href="irene.html">Irene</a></b>
was involved in a <i>coup d'état </i>attempt against Nicephorus
and, because of this, was exiled to the island of Principo, where she became
the Abbess of the Convent of the Mother of God, which she had founded some
years earlier. She would live there until she died roughly a year later.<b><a href="#N_10_">[[10]]</a></b>
<center>
<h3>
A. D. 802-811: Internal Affairs and Policy</h3></center>
A year after the exiling of <b><a href="irene.html">Irene</a></b>, Nicephorus
had to face the first major challenge of his reign. On July 18th or 19th
the strategos of the Anatoliac theme, Bardanes Turcus, was proclaimed emperor
by his troops and, with the exception of the Armeniac theme, was supported
by the other Asiatic themes. This rebellion would be the first of many
that would trouble Nicephorus throughout his nine-year reign. The fact
that only the Asiatic themes revolted has been seen in part as disgruntlement
that Nicephorus was made Emperor without the approval of the Asiatic armies.
Other issues possibly included the fact that Asiatic themes had not received
their pay or the fact that the Byzantine law concerning the distribution
of booty was not enforced.<b><a href="#N_11_">[[11]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The combined army of the Asiatic themes marched to Chrysopolis, an Asian
suburb of Constantinople, and waited, hoping to provoke a general rising
against Nicephorus.<b><a href="#N_12_">[[12]]&nbsp;</a></b>&nbsp; None
was forthcoming and Bardanes was forced to retreat to Malagina in the Ospician
theme.<b><a href="#N_13_">[[13]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; By mid-August his
rebellion began to wither away as two of his trusted aides, the future
emperors <b><a href="leov.html">Leo the Armenian</a></b> and <b><a href="mikeII.html">Michael
the Amorian</a></b>, deserted to Nicephorus  side.<b><a href="#N_14_">[[14]]&nbsp;</a></b>&nbsp;
Soon afterwards Bardanes himself began negotiations with Nicephorus for
amnesty. On September 8th the rebellion collapsed as Bardanes fled to a
monastery he had founded earlier on the island of Prote, taking advantage
of Nicephorus  offer of amnesty to Bardanes and his followers. Having been
tonsured en route to become a monk, Bardanes gave up all pretensions to
the throne and settled into life of the monastery, though he would lose
his eyesight the next year when a band of Lycaonians landed on the island
and blinded him.<b><a href="#N_15_">[[15]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly
afterwards, during the Christmas of 803, Nicephorus crowned his son, <b><a href="stauric.html">Stauracius</a></b>,
as his co-emperor. Though <b><a href="stauric.html">Stauracius</a></b> was
only thirteen at the time, and played no active role in the government,
his coronation ended any question of the succession and made it harder
for a potential usurper to claim the throne.<b><a href="#N_16_">[[16]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Following the collapse of Bardanes  rebellion Nicephorus had to deal with
foreign relations with the Arab Caliphate. It would be A. D. 805 before
Nicephorus could turn his attention to other matters.
<p>At this time Byzantine control over Greece was limited to the coastal
regions, mountainous areas and a few cities.<b><a href="#N_17_">[[17]]</a></b>&nbsp;
During the reign of <b><a href="irene.html">Irene</a></b> the eunuch Stauracius
conducted a raid through the hinterland of the Hellas theme and into the
Peloponnese which overawed the local Slavic tribes; no attempt, however,
to reconquer the area was undertaken until Nicephorus  reign.<b><a href="#N_18_">[[18]]&nbsp;</a></b>
Under the command of the strategos Sclerus of the Hellas theme the Byzantine
army moved quickly into the interior of the peninsula, crushing what resistance
there was and bringing the local tribes under Imperial control. By the
end of the year, A. D. 805 Sclerus was able to communicate the re-conquest
of the entire region to Nicephorus, who was quite naturally delighted at
the ease of the expedition, but immediately set to work on how to keep
the province in the empire s hands.<b><a href="#N_19_">[[19]]</a></b>&nbsp;
Upon learning of communities within the empire who traced their heritage
back to towns within the Peloponnese, Nicephorus began the process of resettling
Greece with voluntary homesteaders.<b><a href="#N_20_">[[20]]</a></b>
</p><p>However, despite the ease with which the strategos had taken the area,
the Peloponnese still was not subdued. Shortly afterwards, between A. D.
805 and 807, the Slavs in the region near Patras, on the Northern Peloponnese,
revolted and, with the aid of Moslem forces from North Africa, laid siege
to the town. Though the revolt would be put down swiftly, the need for
greater Imperial control over the area was evident.<b><a href="#N_21_">[[21]]</a></b>&nbsp;
To cover this need Nicephorus created the Theme of the Peloponnese from
the Theme of Hellas, as a new administrative unit for military and fiscal
purposes<b><a href="#N_22_">.[[22]]&nbsp;</a></b> To help protect the area
from the sea Nicephorus also created a naval theme out of the Archontate
of Cephalonia, guarding not only the western approaches of Greece but also
the Imperial holdings in Dalmatia and Venice. <b><a href="#N_23_">[[23]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Later, around A. D. 809, two additional themes were created in the Balkans,
Thessalonika and Dyrrhachium. Thessalonika was created to help protect
Byzantine advances into the Balkans and to guard against Moslem raiders,
while Dyrrhachium was to act as a shield against Frankish attempts to assume
control over Imperial territories and against Moslem raiders from the North
African states. The military forces of these themes would be based partially
on land forces and partially upon naval forces.<b><a href="#N_24_">[[24]]</a></b>
</p><p>Events of the next two years would distract Nicephorus and kept him
from focusing solely on Greece. In addition to problems with the Arab Caliphate
, Nicephorus also had to choose a new Patriarch upon the death of the very
popular Patriarch Tarasios in early February 806. Nicephorus  choice was
a learned layman, also named Nicephorus, who represented a moderate wing
of the church that was less likely to try to pursue policy counter to that
of the emperor. Nicephorus  ascension to the Patriarchate was challenged
by the abbots Theodore and Plato, the leaders of the Studites. The Studites
were members of the church who comprised the more hardline ecclesiastical
position, and claimed that it was not proper for someone not in the clergy
to rise so quickly. However, they were in the minority opinion and Emperor
Nicephorus was able to secure the Patriarchal throne for his candidate.
Later, when these two were involved in a dispute over a priest who had
officiated at the second marriage of <b><a href="irene.html">Constantine
VI,</a></b> Emperor Nicephorus took advantage of the situation to convene
a synod to consider the case. The ruling from the synod was in favor of
the priest and in the process he exiled the abbots.<b><a href="#N_25_">[[25]]</a></b>
</p><p>Shortly after picking the new Patriarch, Nicephorus planned to lead
an expedition into Bulgaria in 807. However, after Nicephorus discovered
evidence of a high-level conspiracy involving senior military and political
personnel, he turned the expedition back to Constantinople without reaching
Bulgaria.&nbsp; There, Nicephorus was able to find the main conspirators
and punished them by whipping, confiscating their property and exiling
them.<b><a href="#N_26_">[[26]]&nbsp;</a></b>&nbsp; More serious was the
mutiny of the army at Sardica when Nicephorus attempted to have the troops
rebuild the city.<b><a href="#N_27_">[[27]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The army,
which was composed of the elite tagmata and the thematic army of Thrace,
had not yet been paid and as a result protested strenuously at being ordered
to do heavy labor and proceeded to mutiny against Nicephorus. Nicephorus
stood his ground and was able to end the mutiny peacefully, but after identifying
the principal mutineers had them exiled after being whipped and shorn.<b><a href="#N_28_">[[28]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Both of these events show that dissatisfaction with Nicephorus  policies
was reaching high levels in the Imperial court and in the army.
</p><p>Shortly after the mutiny at Sardica, during the years of 809-810, Nicephorus
enacted possibly his most controversial edicts. Called  the vexations 
by Theophanes, these edicts were concerned with military, economic and
fiscal reform. Many of the edicts were actually aimed at reducing the corruption
and essentially tax-dodging by the clergy and the upper class. Others focused
upon increasing the military and civilian presence in the newly-reclaimed
territories in Greece and Macedonia. The first vexation was a variation
of Nicephorus  earlier policy of voluntary transplanting of Byzantine citizens
to the newly reoccupied lands of Greece. However, this time Nicephorus
transferred soldiers and their families from the great themes of Anatolia
to Greece and Macedonia. By effecting a population transfer on this scale,
W. Treadgold estimates possibly 70,000 combined men, women and children
were moved; Nicephorus was not only protecting his newly conquered territory
militarily, but changing Greece from a primarily Slavic land back to Greek.
This action is also seen by W. Kaegi as a means of removing potentially
rebellious soldiers from the Asiatic themes by stationing them with different
units, cutting down on the possibility of revolt<b><a href="#N_29">[[29]]</a></b>
</p><p>The second and ninth  vexations  are essentially aimed at increasing
conscription among the thematic armies from the peasants who earlier would
not have been able to afford the costs of equipment needed to join the
armed forces. Now the costs were covered by the peasants  wealthier neighbors.
The ninth  vexation  was aimed at the naval themes, wherein the peasant
farmers would owe service in the naval forces rather than the land forces.
The other vexations are aimed at fiscal reform; vexation three increased
taxes and provided for a new census of the Empire, while vexation four
removed all previously extended remissions of taxes (in part or whole)
from the books, forcing monasteries to pay their full amounts again, as
well as through vexation five their back-taxes. Vexations six, seven and
eight, which affected both rich and poor alike, respectively (in order)
extended the scope of the Imperial inheritance tax and extended the length
of time during which anyone who found treasure had to turn said treasure
over to the fisc.<b><a href="#N_30_">[[30]]</a></b>
</p><p>The final vexation seems to have been designed to help boost the native
Byzantine merchant marine and stimulate commerce and trade. In this edict
reputable ship-owning or shipbuilding firms were forced to accept loans
of 12 lbs of gold at 16% from the state. In order for the firms to pay
back the loan they would have to expand their trade, thus increasing the
amount of revenue going into the Imperial fisc.<b><a href="#N_31_">[[31]]
</a></b>These
edicts were designed to strengthen the Byzantine state and, in the more
immediate term, prepare the Empire for war against the Bulgarians. In the
long run they helped to lay the foundation for the prosperity of the Macedonian
period of the Byzantine Empire.

<h3>
A. D. 802-811: Foreign Policy-Arab, Frankish and Bulgarian</h3></center>
Following his successful coup Nicephorus began to change <b><a href="irene.html">Irene s</a></b>
foreign policy with the Arab Caliphate, starting in 803 by refusing to
pay the tribute agreed to by <b><a href="irene.html">Irene</a></b>.[<b><a href="#N_32_">[32]]</a></b>
The first response from the Arab Caliphate was a retaliatory cross-border
raid into Cappadocia in August, during the middle of the rebellion of Bardanes
Turcos. The raid, led by the son of Caliph Harun, besieged two border forts
and was able to procure the release of some 300 Arab prisoners<b><a href="#N_33_">.[[33]]&nbsp;</a></b>&nbsp;
The second response was the invasion, under the command of the Caliph Harun
himself, of Anatolia in the latter part of 803 where he laid siege to Heraclea
[in Cappadocia]. Quickly marshaling his army together, Nicephorus moved
into central Anatolia and after two months of negotiations with the Caliph
was able to arrange a truce in return for tribute.<b><a href="#N_34_">[[34]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The next year, however, A. D. 804, Harun launched a new raid into the Anatoliac
theme, defeating the Byzantine army, which was under Nicephorus s direct
command, at Crasos and nearly captured the Emperor. However, the raiders
withdrew without following up on their victory. In A. D. 805, due to unrest
in one the Caliph s eastern provinces [Khurasan], the Caliph made a new
truce with Nicephorus, which included a prisoner exchange, leaving the
Empire secure for the moment.<b><a href="#N_35_">[[35]]</a></b>
<p>Taking advantage of the Caliph s preoccupation with events in Khurasan,
Nicephorus spent part of the campaigning season of A. D. 805 rebuilding
and strengthening fortresses along the Arab-Byzantine border at Ancyra
[in Galatia], Andrasus and Thebasa.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicephorus then followed
this up with a rapid series of raids into Cilicia. <b><a href="#N_36_">[[36]]&nbsp;</a></b>&nbsp;
The response from the Caliphate was not long in coming. In response to
Nicephorus s activities the year before, in A. D. 806 Caliph Harun launched
a massive razzia into the Empire, taking Heraclea [Cappadocia] while his
subordinates raided through the region, taking several border fortresses
in the process, as far as Ancyra.<b><a href="#N_37_">[[37]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With an Arab army reputably 135,000 strong swarming over the Eastern frontier,
Nicephorus sued for peace and after protracted negotiations was able to
agree to terms with Caliph Harun.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the treaty Nicephorus
agreed to pay 30,000 nomismata immediately, and then pay the same amount
annually, of which 3 nomismata were a head tax for Nicephorus and 3 for
his son <b><a href="stauric.html">Stauracius</a></b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition,
Nicephorus pledged not to rebuild the border fortress that had been taken
by the Arabs during the razzia.&nbsp;&nbsp; In return Harun evacuated his
troops from Byzantine territory.<b><a href="#N_39_">[[38]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
However, shortly after the Caliph s withdrawal Nicephorus quickly broke
the peace and began rebuilding the lost border fortresses, apparently never
sending the tribute again. In A. D. 807 the Caliph sent a force to raid
into Byzantine territory that was defeated at the Cilician Gates; a second
force withdrew inconclusively as the Caliph rebuilt and repopulated Tarsus
as a base to check any Imperial advance into Cilicia. A raid on the island
of Rhodes followed in A. D. 808, but the Admiral in charge of the raid
failed to take the town. The death of Caliph Harun in AD 809 relieved the
pressure on the Eastern front and enabled Nicephorus to focus his attention
on matters in the West.<b><a href="#N_39_">[[39]]</a></b>

<h3>
~Relations with Charlemagne~</h3></center>
In the West Nicephorus had to face a very different set of challenges:
the rising power of the Bulgarian Kingdom and the Frankish Empire of Charlemagne.
Shortly before Nicephorus s <i>coup d état </i>in A. D. 802, envoys
from Charlemagne had arrived in Constantinople. Relations between the two
powers had become severely strained when Charlemagne had been crowned Emperor
of the Romans by the Pope. According to Theophanes part of the negotiations
included trying to arrange a marriage between Charlemagne and <b><a href="irene.html">Irene</a></b>.<b><a href="#N_40_">[[40]]&nbsp;</a></b>&nbsp;
Naturally with the ascension of Nicephorus this part of the negotiations
was out of the question. Nicephorus sent the envoys back in the spring
of A. D. 803 to notify Charlemagne of the change in government and to try
to maintain the current peace between the two powers pending additional
negotiations. The envoys also managed to maintain a diplomatic silence
on the subject of Charlemagne s title.
<p>Charlemagne in return was willing to consider himself at peace with
Nicephorus and the Byzantine Empire, while freely recognizing the Byzantine
claims to Venice and Dalmatia, but still considered himself an Emperor.
When Charlemagne s response made it to Nicephorus the next year, it was
never replied to so that the Empire would not have to recognize Charlemagne
as an emperor, which responding to the letter would have done tacitly.<b><a href="#N_41_">[[41]]&nbsp;</a></b>&nbsp;
Three years later, in A. D. 806, the Dukes of Venice, which was still technically
a Byzantine territory, sent a fleet to force the leaders of the Dalmatian
ducates to follow Venetian policy and paid homage to Charlemagne. This
put Venice and the Dalmatian ducates under the control of the Frankish
Empire.<b><a href="#N_42_">[[42]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite his preoccupation
with events in the east at this time, Nicephorus would not stand idly by
and let Imperial territory be lost in the west and so he sent the Fleet
from the Theme of Cephalonia to retake Venice and the Dalmatian cities.
Under its Admiral, Nicetas, the fleet quickly restored Byzantine control
over the Dalmatian cities, prompting the Venetian Dukes to recant their
allegiance to the Franks and restored the situation in the Adriatic to
the former status quo.<b><a href="#N_43_">[[43]]</a></b>&nbsp; Later, in
A. D. 809 or 810, to strengthen Byzantine control over the Dalmatian coast,
Nicephorus made the Ducates of Dalmatia into the Archontate of Dalmatia,
which had a larger number of troops allotted to them.<b><a href="#N_44_">[[44]]</a></b>
</p><p>In A. D. 810 the Venetian Dukes changed sides yet again, submitting
to Charlemagne s son Pepin who then proceeded to take the city. However,
by late spring of A. D. 810 the fleet of the strategos of Cephalonia arrived
off Dalmatia, prompting Pepin to withdraw to the mainland, where he soon
died. A legate was dispatched first to Venice, where he deposed the turncoat
dukes, before continuing on to Aachen to negotiate peace with Charlemagne.<b><a href="#N_45_">[[45]]&nbsp;</a></b>&nbsp;
Charlemagne proved cordial and recognized Byzantine authority over Venice
and Dalmatia, while at the same time dispatching envoys of his own to negotiate
a permanent peace. Peace in the Adriatic would allow Nicephorus to focus
fully on the Bulgarian Kingdom.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><center>
<h3>
~Relations with Bulgars~</h3></center>
The Bulgars had been a significant aspect of Byzantine foreign policy ever
since the days of Constantine IV, who led an ill-fated expedition against
them in A. D. 680.<b><a href="#N_46_">[[46]]</a></b>&nbsp; Despite the
best efforts of the <b><a href="constanv.html">Emperor Constantine V</a></b>,
the Bulgarian Kingdom remained intact and a potentially dangerous neighbor
to have around.<b><a href="#N_47_">[[47]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly after
the
<i>coup d état</i> of Nicephorus, in A. D. 803, Charlemagne
destroyed what remained of the Avar Kingdom; this opened up much of the
former kingdom to Bulgar expansion.&nbsp; This was something the new Khan,
Krum, took advantage of, moving quickly to unite the two Bulgar kingdoms
into one.<b><a href="#N_48_">[[48]</a></b>]&nbsp; This expansion posed
a threat to the continued Byzantine interests in Thrace and the reclamation
of Greece. Recognizing this, Nicephorus planned an expedition in A. D.
807 that was, it appears, intended to overawe the Bulgarians so that annexation
of the Slavic-held territories could continue. However, the expedition
was derailed when a conspiracy was discovered in the ranks of his army.<b><a href="#N_49_">[[49]]</a></b>
<p>Then, before Nicephorus could put a new expedition together, the Bulgar
Khan Krum struck first. In A. D. 808 the Bulgars launched a surprise attack
on the Byzantine Headquarters on the Strymon River, where the strategos
was distributing the payroll for the Thematic soldiers. Taking the camp
utterly by surprise, the Bulgars killed the Macedonian strategos, along
with most of the men before stealing the payroll (1,100 lbs of gold) and
the baggage. Shortly afterwards in early A. D. 809, the Bulgar Khan Krum
marched an army to the town of Sardica and through treachery managed to
take the town. Krum then killed almost all the soldiers, who numbered around
6,000 strong, along with a large number of townspeople, before withdrawing.<b><a href="#N_50_">[[50]]&nbsp;</a></b>&nbsp;
Nicephorus quickly marshaled an army constructed out of the tagmata and
the thematic army of Thrace and marched into Bulgaria, where he took the
capital of Pliska, plundering and possibly burning it before returning
to Sardica. There Nicephorus planned to have the army rebuild the city
and its fortifications, but a mutiny among the tagmatic soldiers, partially
over pay and in part due to being asked to take part in heavy labor, ended
that plan. After returning to Constantinople, Nicephorus began planning
a massive campaign against Bulgaria and began putting into motion policy
changes (see above under Internal Affairs and Policy) to help effect a
victory against the Bulgars.<b><a href="#N_51_">[[51]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<h3>
A. D. 811: Campaign against the Bulgar Khan Krum and Death</h3></center>
For the next two years,810-811, Nicephorus prepared for a massive campaign,
taking advantage of the quiet on the eastern front from the death of Caliph
Harun to pull a large number of Anatolian thematic troops to Europe for
the campaign. When Nicephorus set out in May of A.D. 811 he had a force
that has been estimated at around 71,000 men. Accompanying the expedition
was Nicephorus  son <b><a href="stauric.html">Stauracius</a></b>, his son-in-law
the future emperor<b><a href="mikeI.html"> Michael I Rhangabe</a></b>, and
a large collection of senior dignitaries from the Imperial court.<b><a href="#N_52_">[[52]]</a></b>&nbsp;
Krum was suitably impressed by the massive size of the force arrayed against
him and sent envoys to Nicephorus to sue for peace. However, whatever the
terms were that Krum offered to the Empire, Nicephorus refused them. Shortly
afterwards Nicephorus moved with speed and struck at the Bulgarian capital
of Pliska again, overwhelming the 12,000-man garrison that Krum had left
behind, and then a Bulgarian relief force of roughly 15,000. Nicephorus
next sacked the city, finding the treasury of the Khan in the process,
which was then distributed amongst the troops, and burned the town to the
ground.<b><a href="#N_53_">[[53]]</a></b>
<p>Desperate, Krum reinforced his remaining armies by arming the Bulgarian
women and recruiting Avar and Slavic mercenaries. Despite these measures,
his army still was not large enough to challenge Nicephorus on even terms,
so instead Krum laid a trap for the Byzantine army in the mountains. On
their return march the Byzantine army was trapped in a small valley by
large wooden palisades erected by Krum s forces at either end. After two
days the Bulgars launched an assault on the emperor s camp, during which
Nicephorus was killed, leaving his remaining bodyguard, tagmatic troops
and Imperial dignitaries to flee the battlefield. Shortly after, the themes
joined the rush to escape as well, turning the battlefield into a rout.
The rout cost the Empire an immense number of soldiers from both the tagmata
and the thematic armies, along with a number of senior level commanders
and dignitaries. Nicephorus s son <b><a href="stauric.html">Stauracius,</a></b>
suffering from a near-mortal wound to the spine, was evacuated to Adrianople,
where a struggle over the succession would develop. For the moment both
the Bulgarians and the Empire paused to regroup from their losses, but
the war was far from over.<b><a href="#N_54_">[[54]]</a></b>
<br>&nbsp;
</p><center>
<h3>
Assessment</h3></center>
In the eight years of his reign Nicephorus faced a large number of problems,
both from within the Empire and from without. While it would be a mistake
to characterize Nicephorus as a great emperor, he was a conscientious and
able ruler who was determined to set the Empire back on course. For the
most part, in terms of internal affairs Nicephorus was more successful.
His economic policy, outlined in the so-called  Vexations,  would help
reassert state control over taxation, recruitment into the armed forces
and the near-independent monastic properties. Nicephorus  reconquest of
Greece and the transfer, both volunteer and forced, of citizens from other
areas of the Empire into several newly created themes was to successfully
reestablish Imperial control in an area that had been lost for roughly
two hundred years. Nicephorus  successful selection of his own patriarch,
despite the pressure from the more hardline members of the clergy, helped
strengthen the control of the State over the church.
<div><p>However, in terms of foreign policy and military matters, Nicephorus
does not have the best record. In simple terms Nicephorus was not a great
general and frequently misgauged the mood of his troops, something that
the many mutinies and put down rebellions of the reign can point towards.
His attempts to push the Imperial border beyond the Tarsus and Anti-Tarsus
mountains only provoked several retaliatory raids from the Abbasid Caliph.
Even though these raids came to nothing and the Empire lost no territory,
they caused considerable hardship for the borderlands and gained nothing
in territory. His avoidance of a definite peace treaty with Charlemagne
because of the appropriation of the title of Emperor for the west in part
led to military skirmishes that possibly could have been avoided. And finally,
the military campaigns against the Bulgars were to prove disastrous for
Nicephorus, leading to his death, the destruction of a large portion of
the armed forces and precipitating a succession crisis due to the injury
of his son. However, his military setbacks would ultimately only have a
short?term impact on the Empire, while the changes to the provincial administration,
and the economic reforms he put into place, would make the State stronger
and give later Emperors a sound foundation upon which to expand the Empire.
