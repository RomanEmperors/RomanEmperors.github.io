<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Valentinian was one of Rome's last great warrior emperors.<a href="#N_1_"><b>[[1]]</b></a>     There was a
power vacuum after the death of <a href="julian.html"><b>Julian</b></a>, last ruler of the Neo-Flavian
line.  His immediate successor <a href="jovian.html"><b>Jovian</b></a> did not really survive long
enough to leave his stamp on late Roman society.  In general terms, Valentinian s
challenge was to hold together an empire that had experienced sixty
years of internal unrest, something which was of  major import. His provincial origins and Nicene Christianity put
him at odds with the senatorial nobility in the west.  Furthermore, he
had to deal with the increasing regionalism of the empire, especially in
Gaul, Britain, and Africa.  </p>
<h3>Early Life</h3>
<p>Valentinian, whose full name was Flavius Valentinianus, was born in A.D. 321 at
Cibalis (modern Vinkovci) in southern Pannonia.<a href="#N_2_"><b>[[2]]</b></a>     His father Gratian
was a soldier renowned for his strength and wrestling skills.  Gratian
had an illustrious career in the army, rising from staff officer to
tribune, to <i>comes Africae</i>, and finally <i>comes Britanniae</i>.  He was
suspected of graft while <i>comes Africae</i>, but nothing was ever proven.
After he retired,<a href="constaii.html"><b> Constantius II</b></a> (337-60) confiscated his estates
because he was suspected of having been a supporter of <a href="magnent.html"><b>Magnentius</b></a>.<a href="#N_3_"><b>[[3]]</b></a>  Gratian s alleged affiliation with
<a href="magnent.html"><b>Magnentius</b></a> apparently did not keep Valentinian or his younger brother
<a href="valens.html"><b>Valens</b></a> from being able to enter the military, but it may have contributed to some
early trouble for Valentinian.  Valentinian
embarked upon a military career, and, like his father, became a
victim of imperial politics.  In 357 he was tribune of cavalry under
<a href="julian.html"><b>Julian</b></a>, <a href="constaii.html"><b>Constantius II's</b></a> Caesar in the west.  In the intrigues
surrounding <a href="julian.html"><b>Julian</b></a> and <a href="constaii.html"><b>Constantius</b></a>, Valentinian and a colleague were
accused of undermining operations, and <a href="constaii.html"><b>Constantius</b></a> dismissed them from
the service.<a href="#N_4_"><b>[[4]]</b></a>  Valentinian was married twice.  His first wife, Severa, died some time after giving birth to
Valentinian s first son <a href="gratian.html"><b>Gratian</b></a> in 359, and Valentinian married Justina,
by whom he had <a href="valenii.html"><b>Valentinian II</b></a>, and two daughters, Galla and Justa.<a href="#N_5_"><b>[[5]]</b></a>  </p>
     <p>When <a href="julian.html"><b>Julian</b></a> died, Valentinian was recalled to military service by
<a href="jovian.html"><b>Jovian</b></a>. Upon his accession, <a href="jovian.html"><b>Jovian</b></a> sent Procopius, a <i>notarius</i>, and
Memoridus to Gaul and Illyricum to install his father-in-law
Lucillianus, in retirement at Sirmium, as <i>magister equitum et peditum</i>.
Lucillianus in turn was to journey to Milan and secure <a href="jovian.html"><b>Jovian s</b></a> power in
Italy and Gaul. <a href="jovian.html"><b> Jovian</b></a> supposedly gave Lucillianus secret instructions
to handpick a select cadre of supporters.<a href="#N_6_"><b>[[6]]</b></a>     Two of these men were
Valentinian and Seniauchus.<a href="#N_7_"><b>[[7]]</b></a>     One of this group s missions was to
displace Jovinus,<a href="julian.html"><b> Julian s</b></a> <i>magister armorum per Gallias</i>, with
Malarichus, a retired soldier and supporter of <a href="jovian.html"><b>Jovian</b></a> living in Italy.
In addition they were to visit as many governors and military commanders
as possible and announce the successful end of the Persian campaign and
<a href="jovian.html"><b>Jovian's</b></a> succession.<a href="#N_8_"><b>[[8]]</b></a>     Malarichus, however, refused his commission,
and Lucillianus traveled on to Rheims where he began examining the
accounts of one of<a href="julian.html"><b> Julian s</b></a> officials.  The official (not named in
extant sources) fled to the
army in Gaul and spread rumors that <a href="julian.html"><b>Julian</b></a> was still alive and that
Lucillianus was a rebel.  In the riot that broke out, Seniauchus and
Lucillianus were killed, and Valentinian barely escaped through the help
of his friend Primitivus.  By this time,<a href="jovian.html"><b> Jovian</b></a> had sent some
additional soldiers who secured peace in Gaul.  As a result Valentinian was promoted
to command of the second Scutarii division.<a href="#N_9_"><b>[[9]]</b></a>  </p>
<h3>Valentinian's Accession</h3>   
  <p><a href="jovian.html"><b>Jovian </b></a>died on 17 February 364, apparently of natural causes, on
the border between Bithynia and Galatia.<a href="#N_10_"><b>[[10]]</b></a>     The army marched on to
Nicaea, the nearest city of any consequence, and a meeting of civil and
military officials was convened to choose a new emperor.  The names of
Aequitius, a tribune of the first Scutarii, and Januarius, a relative of
<a href="jovian.html"><b>Jovian s</b></a> in charge of military supplies in Illyricum, were bandied
about.  Both were rejected, Aequitius as too brutal, Januarius because
he was too far away.  The assembly finally agreed upon Valentinian, and
sent messengers to inform him, as he had been left behind at Ancyra with
his unit.  While awaiting the arrival of Valentinian, Aequitius and Leo,
another Pannonian in charge of distributing supplies to the soldiers of
Dagalaifus,<i> magister equitum</i>, managed to keep the  fickle  (<i>mobilitas</i>)
soldiers from choosing another emperor.<a href="#N_11_"><b>[[11]]</b></a>  </p>
     <p>Valentinian arrived in Nicaea on 24 February 364, the bisextile
day.  This day was used every four years by the Romans to balance the
calendar much as we use the modern leap year day: the <i>sixth day</i>
(counting inclusively) before the first of March was counted twice.
  According to Ammianus, this day was considered an ill-omened day to begin any new proceedings, so
Valentinian put off his official acceptance until the day after the
bisextile.<a href="#N_12_"><b>[[12]]</b></a> Furthermore, the prefect Salutius declared that no
official business could be conducted on the repeated day.  The holiday would have prevented any attempt to
name another emperor before Valentinian.<a href="#N_13_"><b>[[13]]</b></a>  </p>
 <p>    On 26 February 364, Valentinian accepted the office offered to
him.  As he prepared to make his accession speech, the soldiers
threatened to riot, apparently uncertain as to where his loyalties lay.
Valentinian reassured them that the army was his greatest priority.
Furthermore, to prevent a crisis of succession if he should die
prematurely, he agreed to pick a co-Augustus.  According to Ammianus,
the soldiers were astounded by Valentinian s bold demeanor and his
willingness to assume the imperial authority.<a href="#N_14_"><b>[[14]]</b></a>      His decision to
elect a fellow-emperor could also be construed as a move to appease any
opposition among the civilian officials in the eastern portion of the
empire.  By agreeing to appoint a co-ruler, he assured the eastern
officials that someone with imperial authority would remain in the east
to protect their interests.</p>
    <p> After promoting his brother <a href="valens.html"><b>Valens</b></a> to the rank of tribune and
putting him in charge of the royal stables on March 1, Valentinian
selected<a href="valens.html"><b> Valens</b></a> as co-Augustus at Constantinople on 28 March 364, though
this was done over the objections of Dagalaifus.<a href="#N_15_"><b>[[15]]</b></a>     Ammianus makes it
clear, however, that <a href="valens.html"><b>Valens</b></a> was clearly subordinate to his
brother.<a href="#N_16_"><b>[[16]]</b></a>     The remainder of 364 was spent dividing up administrative
duties and military commands.  Valentinian retained the services of
Jovinus and Dagalaifus, and promoted Aequitius to <i>comes Illyricum</i>.  In
addition, he promoted Serenianus, a retired soldier and fellow Pannonian,
to command of the <i>domesticorum scholae</i>.<a href="#N_17_"><b>[[17]]</b></a>     Several sources mention
the division of administrative spheres between the two brothers, but
Ammianus is the most specific.<a href="#N_18_"><b>[[18]]</b></a>     According to Ammianus, <a href="valens.html"><b>Valens</b></a> was
given the Prefecture of the Orient, governed by Salutius, while
Valentinian gained control of the Prefecture of the Gauls and the
Prefecture of Italy, Africa, and Illyricum.  These latter three areas
were put together as one administrative unit under control of the
prefect Mamertinus.  <a href="valens.html"><b>Valens</b></a> resided in Constantinople, while
Valentinian s court was at Milan.<a href="#N_19_"><b>[[19]]</b></a>  </p>
    <h3>Valentinian and the Army</h3>
<p>  One of the first problems that faced Valentinian was an outbreak of
hostilities in Gaul with the Alamanni, a loose confederation of Germanic-speaking peoples living beyond the Rhine.  According to Ammianus, the
Alamanni were upset because Valentinian would not supply them with the
level of tribute that previous emperors had paid them.  In response to
this insult and the ill treatment their envoys received at the hands of
the<i> magister officiorum </i>Ursatius, the Alamanni invaded Gaul in 365.<a href="#N_20_"><b>[[20]]</b></a>  
At the same time <a href="procopis.html"><b>Procopius</b></a> began his revolt against <a href="valens.html"><b>Valens</b></a> in the east.
Valentinian received news of both the Alamannic trouble and <a href="procopis.html"><b>Procopius'</b></a>
revolt on 1 November while on his way to Paris.<a href="#N_21_"><b>[[21]]</b></a>     He had a choice to
make--go east to help his brother or stay in Gaul and fight the
Alamanni.  He initially sent Dagalaifus to fight the Alamanni, while he
himself made preparations to journey east and help <a href="valens.html"><b>Valens</b></a>.  After
receiving counsel from his court and deputations from the leading Gallic
cities begging him to stay and protect Gaul, however, he decided to
remain in Gaul and fight the Alamanni.<a href="#N_22_"><b>[[22]]</b></a>  </p>
   <p>  This move shows two things.  First, that Valentinan subordinated the eastern portion of the empire to
the west.  In addition it shows
that Valentinian was still unsure of his support in Gaul, a very
important part of the west.  There was no better way to win the support
of the Gallic nobility than by performing the traditional imperial duty
of preserving peace by defeating barbarians.  This ideology is amply
illustrated by the coinage issued from Gaul during this period.
Valentinian issued such series as <i>RESTITUTOR REIPUBLICAE</i>, <i>GLORIA
ROMANORUM</i>, and <i>TRIUMFATOR GENT BARB</i> from the mints at Trier, Lyon, and
Arles.<a href="#N_23_"><b>[[23]]</b></a>  </p>
    <p> Valentinian advanced to Rheims and sent two generals, Charietto and
Severianus, against the invaders.  The armies of Charietto and Severianus were
promptly defeated and the generals killed.  Dagalaifus was then sent
against the enemy in 366, but the Alamanni were so scattered about Gaul
that he was ineffective.  Jovinus replaced Dagalaifus late in the
campaigning season, and, after several battles, he pushed the Alamanni out
of Gaul.  He was awarded the consulate of 367 for his efforts.<a href="#N_24_"><b>[[24]]</b></a>  </p>
    <p> Valentinian was distracted from launching a punitive expedition
against the Alamanni at this time by problems in Britain and
northern Gaul.  The Alamanni, however,
were not deterred by their earlier defeat at the hands of Jovinus and they 
returned to Gaul.  The city of Mainz was attacked and plundered by an
Alamannic raiding party in late 367 or early 368.  Valentinian did
succeed in getting Roman agents to arrange the assassination of
Vithicabius, an important Alamannic leader, by his personal bodyguard, but
more serious measures were called for.  Valentinian was determined to
bring the Alamanni under Roman power once and for all, and spent the
winter of 367/8 gathering a huge army for a spring offensive.  He
summoned the <i>comes</i> Sebastianus, who was in charge of the Italian and
Illyrian legions, to join Jovinus and Severus, <i>magister peditum</i>.
Valentinian and his army, accompanied by <a href="gratian.html"><b>Gratian</b></a>, crossed the Main river
in the spring of 368.  They did not encounter any resistance until they
reached Solicinium (Schwetzingen), burning any dwellings or food stores
they found along the way.  A tremendous battle was fought at
Schwetzingen, with the Romans coming out on top, although Valentinian was
nearly killed.  A temporary peace was apparently reached, and
Valentinian and <a href="gratian.html"><b>Gratian</b></a> returned to Trier for the winter.<a href="#N_25_"><b>[[25]]</b></a>  </p>
    <p> During 369, Valentinian  ordered new defensive
works to be constructed and old structures refurbished along the length of the Rhine s
left bank.  In an even bolder move, he ordered the construction of a
fortress across the Rhine, in the mountains near Heidelberg.  The
Alamanni sent envoys to protest, but they were
dismissed out of hand.  As a result, the Alamanni attacked while the fortress was
still under construction, destroyed it, and killed all the soldiers
guarding it.<a href="#N_26_"><b>[[26]]</b></a>  </p>
    <p> In 370, the Saxons renewed their attacks on northern Gaul.
Nannienus, the <i>comes</i> in charge of the troops in northern Gaul, had to
ask Severus to come to his aid.  After several battles, a truce was
called and the Saxons gave the Romans many young men fit for duty in the
Roman military in exchange for free passage back to their homeland.  The
Romans, however, treacherously ambushed the Saxons, killing them
all.<a href="#N_27_"><b>[[27]]</b></a>     At this same time, Valentinian was contemplating another
attack against the Alamanni.  His target was Macrianus, another powerful
Alamannic chieftain.  Rather than directly attack Macrianus, he tried to
persuade the Burgundians to attack: they were another Germanic-speaking people, and bitter enemies of the Alamanni.  
If the Alamanni tried to flee, Valentinian would be waiting for them with his army.
Negotiations, however, with the Burgundians broke down when Valentinian,
in his usual high-handed manner, refused to meet with the Burgundian
envoys and personally assure them of Roman support in the suggested
attack.  Nevertheless, the proposed alliance with the Burgundians did
have the effect of scattering the Alamanni through fear of an imminent
attack from their enemies. This event allowed Theodosius, <i>magister
equitum</i>, to attack via Raetia and take many Alamannic prisoners.  These
captured Alamanni were settled in the Po river valley, where they still
flourished at the time Ammianus wrote his history.<a href="#N_28_"><b>[[28]]</b></a>  </p>
    <p> Valentinian campaigned unsuccessfully for four more years to defeat
Macrianus.  In 372 Macrianus barely escaped capture by Theodosius.  In
the meantime, Valentinian continued to recruit heavily from those
Alamanni friendly to the Roman cause.  He sent the Alamannic king
Fraomarius, along with Alamannic troops commanded by Bitheridius and
Hortarius, to Britain in order to replenish troops there.<a href="#N_29_"><b>[[29]]</b></a>  
Valentinian s Alamannic campaigns, however, were hampered by troubles
first in Africa, and later on the Danube.  In 374 Valentinian was
forced to make peace with Macrianus because the emperor's presence was needed to
counter an invasion of Illyricum by the Quadi and Sarmatians.<a href="#N_30_"><b>[[30]]</b></a>  </p>
<h3>Military Problems in Britain, Gaul, and on the Danube</h3>
    <p>In 367, Valentinian received reports
that a combined force of Picts, Attacotti and Scots had killed
Nectaridus (<i>comes maritimi tractus</i>) and overcome the <i>dux</i> Fullofaudes in
Britain.  As a consequence, Britain was in a state of anarchy.  At the
same time, Frankish and Saxon forces were harrying the coastal areas of
northern Gaul.  Valentinian, alarmed by these reports, set out for
Britain, sending Severus (<i>comes domesticorum</i>) ahead of him to
investigate.  Severus was not able to correct the situation and returned
to the continent, meeting Valentinian at Amiens.  Valentinian then sent
Jovinus to Britain and promoted Severus to <i>magister peditum</i>.  It was at
this time that Valentinian fell ill and a battle for succession broke out between
Severus, a representative of the army, and Rusticus Julianus, <i>magister
memoriae</i> and a representative of the Gallic nobility.  Valentinian, however, recovered and appointed his son <a href="gratian.html"><b>Gratian</b></a> as
co-Augustus to forestall any such conflicts in the future.  Ammianus remarks
 that such an action was unprecedented.<a href="#N_31_"><b>[[31]]</b></a></p>
   <p>  Jovinus quickly returned, saying that he needed more men to take
care of the situation.  Beginning in 368 Valentinian, however, was intent on pressing his
successes against the Alamanni with a campaign into their territory.  Therefore, he assigned the<i> comes </i>Theodosius the
task of recovering Britain while Severus and Jovinus were to accompany
the emperor on his campaign.<a href="#N_32_"><b>[[32]]</b></a>   Theodosius arrived in 368 with the
Batavi, Heruli, Jovii and Victores legions, landing at Richborough, and
proceeded to London.  His initial expeditions restored order to
southern Britain. Later he rallied the remaining troops which
had originally been stationed in Britain.  It was apparent that the
units had lost their cohesiveness when Nectaridius and Fullofaudes had
been defeated.  At this time, Theodosius sent for Civilis to be
installed as the new <i>vicarius</i> of the diocese, and Dulcitius, an
additional general.<a href="#N_33_"><b>[[33]]</b></a></p>
    <p> In 369, Theodosius, relying on the tactics of stealth and ambush,
 set about reconquering the areas north of London.  During this period,
he put down the revolt of Valentinus, the brother-in-law of Maximinus,
at that time a <i>vicarius</i>.  Valentinus had been exiled to Britain for
crimes that Ammianus does not specify and was apparently fomenting a rebellion against the
imperial government.  Theodosius learned of these plans through spies
and quashed the revolt before it got off the ground.  After this,
Theodosius restored destroyed fortifications and even recovered a lost
province which was renamed Valentia.<a href="#N_34_"><b>[[34]]</b></a>   After his return in 369,
Valentinian promoted Theodosius to<i> magister equitum</i> in place of
Jovinus.<a href="#N_35_"><b>[[35]]</b></a></p>
<h3>Revolt of Firmus</h3>
     <p>In 372, the rebellion of <a href="firmus.html"><b>Firmus</b></a> broke out in the African
provinces.  This rebellion was driven by the corruption of the <i>comes</i>
Romanus.   When he took sides in the murderous disputes among the
legitimate and illegitimate children of Nubel, a Moorish prince and
leading Roman client in Africa, resentment of Romanus' peculations and
failure to defend the territory caused some of the provincials to
revolt.  Valentinian was forced to send in Theodosius to restore
imperial control.  Over the next two years Theodosius uncovered Romanus'
crimes, arrested him and his cronies, and defeated <a href="firmus.html"><b>Firmus</b></a>.
<a href="#N_36_"><b>[[36]]</b></a></p>
     <p> In 373 trouble erupted with the Quadi, a group of Germanic-speaking people
living on the Danube.  Like the Alamanni, the Quadi were
outraged that Valentinian was building fortifications in their
territory.  They complained and sent deputations that were ignored by
the <i>magister armorum per Illyricum</i> Aequitius.  It seems, however, that
by 373 the construction of these forts was behind schedule.  Maximinus,
now praetorian prefect of Gaul, arranged with Aequitius to promote his
son Marcellianus to the rank of <i>dux per Valeriam</i> and put him in charge of finishing
the project.  The protests of Quadic leaders continued to delay the
project, and in a fit of frustration, Marcellianus murdered the Quadic
king Gabinius at a banquet ostensibly arranged for peaceful
negotiations.  This roused the Quadi to war, along with their allies the
Sarmatians.  During the fall harvest, they broke across the
Danube and began ravaging the province of Valeria. The marauders could
not penetrate the fortified cities, but they heavily damaged the
unprotected countryside.  Two legions, the Pannonica and Moesiaca, were
sent in, but they failed to coordinate their efforts and were routed by
the Sarmatians.  At the same time, another group of Sarmatians invaded Moesia, but they were driven back by the <i>dux Moesiae</i>
<a href="theo1.html"><b>Theodosius the younger</b></a>, future emperor and son of the <i>magister
equitum</i>.<a href="#N_37_"><b>[[37]]</b></a></p>
    <p> Valentinian did not receive news of these
disasters until mid-to-late 374.  In the spring of 375 he set out from
Trier and came to Carnuntum, which was deserted.  There he was
met by Sarmatian envoys who begged forgiveness for their actions.
Valentinian replied that he would investigate what had happened and act
accordingly.  Valentinian ignored Marcellianus  treacherous actions and
decided to punish the Quadi.  He, accompanied by Sebastianus and Merobaudes, 
 spent the summer months preparing for the campaign and finally crossed 
into Quadic territory at Aquincum (Budapest). After generally pillaging the Quadic lands and carrying out acts of terrorism,
he retired to Savaria (Szombathely) to winter quarters.  For unknown
reasons, he decided to continue campaigning and moved from Savaria to
Brigetio (Komarom-Szony).<a href="#N_38_"><b>[[38]]</b></a>   It was here that he received a
deputation from the Quadi on November 18.  In return for supplying fresh
recruits to the Roman army, the Quadi were to be allowed to leave in
peace.  Before the envoys left, however, they were granted an audience
with Valentinian.  The envoys insisted that the conflict was caused by
the building of Roman forts in their lands, and that furthermore
individual bands of Quadi were not necessarily bound to the rule of the
chiefs who had made treaties with the Romans, and thus might attack at
any time.  The attitude of the envoys so enraged Valentinian that he
suffered a stroke that ended his life.<a href="#N_39_"><b>[[39]]</b></a></p>
  <h3>Roman Society under Valentinian</h3>
<p> Ammianus and Zosimus as well as modern scholars praise Valentinian
for his military accomplishments.<a href="#N_40_"><b>[[40]]</b></a>   He is generally credited with
keeping the Roman empire from crumbling away by  . . . reversing the
generally waning confidence in the army and imperial defense . .
.. <a href="#N_41_"><b>[[41]]</b></a>   Several other aspects of Valentinian's reign also set the
course of Roman history for the next century.  Valentinian deliberately
polarized Roman society, subordinating the civilian population to the
military.  The military order took over the old prestige of the
senatorial nobility.  The imperial court, which was becoming more and
more of a military court, became a vehicle for social mobility.  There
were new ideas of nobility, which was increasingly provincial in
character.  By this it is meant that the imperial court, not the Senate,
was the seat of nobility, and most of these <i>new</i> nobles came from the
provinces.  With the erosion of the <i>old</i> nobility, the stage was set
for the ascendancy of Christianity.  At the same time, the empire was
becoming more and more of a bureaucracy, with the emperor delegating
authority to a chain of officials.  These officials did not always
perform their job well and, as a result, the provincial populations
became increasingly alienated from the imperial government.  They were
crushed under the increasing burden of taxation, and often the emperor,
through his delegates, failed to provide the security for which the
provincials' tribute was paying.<a href="#N_42_"><b>[[42]]</b></a> </p>
<h3>Valentinian, Christianity, and Legislation</h3>
    <p> Unlike his brother <a href="valens.html"><b>Valens</b></a>, Valentinian refused to become embroiled
in the religious controversies of the time.  Ammianus praised
Valentinian for his religious neutrality.<a href="#N_43_"><b>[[43]]</b></a>  Valentinian refused to
get involved in the Arian controversy of the east, dismissing a
deputation of eastern Nicene bishops who appealed to him to control
<a href="valens.html"><b>Valens</b></a>.<a href="#N_44_"><b>[[44]]</b></a>   Valentinian did, however, take a harsh stand against two
of the heretical movements that had grown during the past century in the west.  In 372 he forbade gatherings of Manichees in the
city of Rome.  Such assemblies were to result in the death of the
leaders, the exile of the others, and confiscation of the property of
all involved.<a href="#N_45_"><b>[[45]]</b></a>   In addition he officially condemned Donatist
bishops in Africa in 373.<a href="#N_46_"><b>[[46]]</b></a></p>
    <p> The ecclesiastical sources for this period generally have a
favorable opinion of Valentinian.  Jerome speaks in glowing terms,
saying  Valentinian was an excellent emperor in most cases and similar
in character to Aurelian, save only that certain people interpreted his
excessive strictness and parsimony as cruelty and greed. <a href="#N_47_"><b>[[47]]</b></a>   Socrates
and Orosius took the story of his dismissal from the military by
<a href="constaii.html"><b>Constantius II</b></a> and turned him into a martyr of sorts.  According to
Sozomen, Valentinian was dismissed from the military by <a href="julian.html"><b>Julian</b></a>, instead
of <a href="constaii.html"><b>Constantius II</b></a>, for refusing to perform a pagan ritual at a pagan shrine.<a href="#N_48_"><b>[[48]]</b></a>   
 Less accurately, Theoderet, Sozomen, and Socrates praised
Valentinian for installing Ambrose as bishop of Milan.  Ambrose s
predecessor, Auxentius, had been an Arian.<a href="#N_49_"><b>[[49]]</b></a></p>
    <p> Valentinian, however, was not uniformly friendly towards
Christianity.  For example, he ordered Symmachus,<i> praefectus urbi</i> of Rome in 365, to put to death
and confiscate the property of any Christians who became custodians of
temples.<a href="#N_50_"><b>[[50]]</b></a>   It seems, however, that much of his legislation
concerning Christians was driven by fiscal motives, rather than any real
concern with religious doctrine.  Any Manichees caught under the law
contributed their property to the fisc, and the condemnation of the
Donatists could really be seen as a condemnation of those who inhibited
the collection of taxes from the African provinces.  In other examples,
Valentinian addressed a law to Damasus, Pope of Rome in 370, which
forbade ecclesiastics to marry widows or female wards of the state.
The purpose of this law was to stop churchmen from
obtaining the wealth of such women through inheritance.<a href="#N_51_"><b>[[51]]</b></a>   On the
other hand, Valentinian appears to have given Christians special
privileges.  For example, in 370 he upheld a law of <a href="constaii.html"><b>Constantius II</b></a> that
exempted professed Nicene Christians in the African provinces from
obligatory municipal duties.<a href="#N_52_"><b>[[52]]</b></a>   Similarly, a law was passed in 371
that those in the city of Rome who could prove that they were
ecclesiastics before the accession of Valentinian were exempt from
municipal services.<a href="#N_53_"><b>[[53]]</b></a></p>
<p>     Revenues lost by these measures had to be made up from other sources, and Valentinian
sought them from the senatorial order.  In a law promulgated on 18 October 365
in Paris and reaching Carthage on 18 January 366, Valentinian ordered
Dracontius, <i>vicarius Africae</i>, to send out men to collect taxes from
those African estates which were owned by Roman senators.<a href="#N_54_"><b>[[54]]</b></a>   This law
was in keeping with Valentinian s general hostility to the senatorial
order.</p>
   <p>  Initially, it seemed that Valentinian actively sought to pacify
the pagan aristocracy at Rome by retaining the title <i>pontifex maximus</i>
and by passing legislation confirming toleration of the pagan practice of
divination.<a href="#N_55_"><b>[[55]]</b></a>   In 371, however, he sanctioned a purge of the nobility
by the <i>praefectus annonae</i> Maximinus, whom he temporarily elevated to the
office of urban prefect for this purpose.  Members of the aristocracy were
brought before Maximinus and Valentinian s old friend Leo on charges
 such as using magic, using poison, and
 adultery.<a href="#N_56_"><b>[[56]]</b></a>   Punishments ranged
from exile to death.  Ammianus cites many such cases, including those of the
senators Cethegus, killed for adultery, and Paphius and Cornelius,
prosecuted and executed for using poison.<a href="#N_57_"><b>[[57]]</b></a> 
  The scale of Maximinus  prosecutions was such that even children 
were tried.  One Alypius, whom
Ammianus describes as <i>nobilis adulescens</i>, was exiled for an offense 
Ammianus does not specify (and thus implies was trumped up), while Lollianus,
 son of the ex-prefect Lampadius, was sentenced
to exile for writing a book concerning the destructive use of magic
(<i>noxiarum artium</i>).  Lampadius appealed to Valentinian, who turned the case
over to Phalangius, governor of Baetica, who sentenced Lollianus to
death.<a href="#N_57_"><b>[[57]]</b></a></p>
 <p>    Ammianus makes it clear that actions such as these were part of a
systematic plan by Valentinian to erode the power and prestige of the
senatorial aristocracy.  It was at the request of Maximinus that
Valentinian abrogated the right of persons of senatorial rank to appeal cases
to the emperor, a right that had already been strictly curtailed during
the reign of Ampelius, Maximinus  predecessor as urban prefect.  He did this by treating as treasonous  such acts as adultery, use of
magic, and poisoning.  He also empowered Maximinus to
use torture to extract confessions from the accused.<a href="#N_59_"><b>[[59]]</b></a>    As with 
Lollianus, the appeals that were heard often resulted in a harsher
punishment than the original sentence.</p>
   <p>  Several pieces of extant legislation seem to confirm Ammianus 
allegations that Valentinian was eroding senatorial prestige.  In a law
of 364, Valentinian decreed that the <i>equites</i> now
ranked in prestige only behind the senatorial order.  In addition, these
<i>equites</i> were exempt from the more onerous forms of compulsory service
and senatorial taxes.<a href="#N_60_"><b>[[60]]</b></a>   Furthermore, a second law issued in 367 gave
members of the imperial court the same privileges as senators.  This law
also established that discharged <i>comites</i> and tribunes could become
senators.<a href="#N_61_"><b>[[61]]</b></a></p>
<p>     In July of 372, Valentinian sent several pieces of legislation to
Ampelius, <i>praefectus urbi</i> of Rome, putting members of the imperial court
and the military on equal footing with those who occupied places in the
civil administration.  First, <i>magistri peditum</i> and <i>magistri equitum</i> were
to be of equal social prestige to praetorian prefects.  In addition, quaestors,
<i>magistri officiorum</i>, the <i>comes sacrarum largitionum</i>, the <i>comes rerum
privatarum</i>, <i>comites rei militaris</i>, and <i>magistri equitum</i> outranked
proconsular governors.  Finally, any member of the imperial court
outranked <i>vicarii</i>.<a href="#N_62_"><b>[[62]]</b></a></p>
   <p>  Ammianus also observes that Valentinian s main goal was
to raise the prestige of the military.  Zosimus confirms this by
stating that Valentinian promoted many officers, and modified the system
of tax collection so that the army got its supplies more quickly. Valentinian issued several laws
expressly intended to make the collection of taxes easier.  In 367, Valentinian instructed Probus that tax
payments in kind could now be made in three installments <i>per annum</i> or all
at once.<a href="#N_63_"><b>[[63]]</b></a>  In addition, Valentinian raised the standard exactions.
This increase in taxation alienated the provincials.</p>
    <p> The African provinces illustrate this effect of Valentinian s tax
policies.  When Romanus, as the military representative of the imperial
government, came to power in 363, he began exploiting the provincials in
the African diocese.  When they refused to meet his exorbitant demands,
he left them to the vagaries of such peoples as the Austoriani.  In
addition, when Valentinian sent Palladius, a tribune and <i>notarius</i>, to
investigate, Romanus split the stolen tax revenue with him to prevent
Palladius from reporting his misconduct to Valentinian.<a href="#N_64_"><b>[[64]]</b></a>   As a
result of Romanus  actions, the provincials balked at paying any taxes.
The fact that Valentinian had to resend the law directly to
Dracontius, the vicarius of Africa in 367, confirms that the government
was having a hard time in collecting its tribute.<a href="#N_65_"><b>[[65]]</b></a>
Valentinian was very distressed by the situation, dispatching the
<i>notarius</i> Neoterius, the <i>protector domesticus</i> Masaucio, and Gaudentius,
a tribune of the Scutarii, to Africa in 365.<a href="#N_66_"><b>[[66]]</b></a>   Theodosius took steps
to ameliorate the situation upon his arrival, declaring that the
provincials did not have to supply his army.  He would take any supplies
he needed from the supporters of <a href="firmus.html"><b>Firmus</b></a>.<a href="#N_67_"><b>[[67]]</b></a></p>
     <p>In addition, when Valentinian came to Pannonia in 375, the
provincials took the opportunity to complain bitterly about the
oppression they had suffered under Probus, praetorian prefect for the
region.  According to Ammianus, the taxation was so onerous in Pannonia
that many of the leading nobles fled, were imprisoned for debt, or
killed themselves.<a href="#N_68_"><b>[[68]]</b></a>   There may have been similar unrest in Gaul, for
Ammianus reported that there was an outbreak of civil unrest among the
provincials there in 369, although he gives no details.<a href="#N_69_"><b>[[69]]</b></a>   Scholars
such as Raymond Van Dam see such provincial outbreaks as signs that the
imperial system was devolving to the local level.<a href="#N_70_"><b>[[70]]</b></a></p>
<h3>Assessment of Valentinian's Reign</h3>    
<p> Valentinian's reign affords valuable insights into late Roman
society, civilian as well as military.  First, there
was a growing fracture between the eastern and western portions of the
empire.  Valentinian was the last emperor to really concentrate his
resources on the west.  <a href="valens.html"><b>Valens</b></a> was clearly in an inferior position in
the partnership.  Second, there was a growing polarization of society,
both Christian versus pagan, and civil versus military.  Finally there
was a growing regionalism in the west, driven by heavy taxation and the
inability of Valentinian to fully exercise military authority in all
areas of the west.  All of these trends would continue over the next
century, profoundly reshaping the Roman empire and western Europe.
