<h3>Martina (Second Wife of Heraclius)</h3>
<center><p><b>Lynda Garland</b></p></center>

<p>
<img src="/martina.jpg" alt="Coin of Martina (c) 2000 Chris Connell" height="120" width="130">Martina is on the right, Heraclius Constantine
is on the left. 
</p><p>  Martina was to have the doubtful honour of being one of the most hated rulers of any period in
Byzantium, and of being probably the most detested empress of all time. Her husband, the
emperor <b><a href="heraclis.html">Heraclius</a></b> (610-41), had been married
 before. His marriage to the extremely popular
<b><a href="fabia.html">Fabia-Eudocia</a></b> took place on the same day 
as his coronation, 5 October 610, but she died of
epilepsy in August 612, leaving a son and a daughter.</p>
<p> <a href="fabia.html"><b> Fabia</b></a> was a hard act for any empress to follow. To make matters worse Martina, who was
considerably younger than <a href="heraclis.html"><b>Heraclius</b></a>, was his niece, the daughter of his sister Maria, by her first
marriage to a certain Martinus. This incestuous relationship went against all the rulings of the
church,<b><a href="#N_1_">[[1]]</a></b> and caused violent reactions
 from both clergy and populace, which were to complicate
considerably <a href="heraclis.html"><b>Heraclius'</b></a> reign and those of 
his sons <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Heraclius Constantine (Constantine III)</b></a> and
<a href="heraclon.html"><b>Heraclonas</b></a>.</p>
<center><h3>Uncle and niece</h3></center>
<p>The date at which the marriage and Martina's coronation as Augusta 
took place is disputed:
Theophanes places the marriage shortly after the death of <a href="fabia.html"><b>Eudocia</b></a> 
in 612/13,<b><a href="#N_2_">[[2]]</a></b> though Nicephorus
does not record it until after the Avar attack of 623.<b><a href="#N_3_">[[3]]</a></b> <a href="heraclis.html"><b>Heraclius</b></a>' 
coinage between 615 and 629
has been used to support the argument both ways. The marriage must have occurred before 615/6
if Martina is the female figure who appears on the copper coinage with 
<a href="heraclis.html"><b>Heraclius</b></a> and her stepson
from year six of the reign, though it has been suggested that this figure is <a href="fabia.html"><b>Epiphania-Eudocia,</b></a>
<a href="heraclis.html"><b>Heraclius'</b></a> eldest daughter, who was crowned Augusta as a baby.<b><a href="#N_4_">[[4]]</a></b> This empress 
wears a crown
adorned with pyramids and long pendilia, and her position on the left of 
the coin shows her as
taking rank after the heir, <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Heraclius Constantine</b></a>. 
While it is possible that such coins might have
been issued depicting <a href="fabia.html"><b>Epiphania</b></a> prior to Martina's marriage, it is highly unlikely that coins
representing not Martina but her young step-daughter would continue to
 be issued once Martina
became empress. It is therefore possible to use these coins as evidence for the date of Martina's
marriage and for her concern to underline her own status as being equivalent to that of other
empresses from <a href="sophia.html"><b>Sophia</b></a>, wife of <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin II</b></a>, on. That 
the populace at least thought that the figure on
the coins was Martina is shown by one example from the Dumbarton 
Oaks Collection, where the
empress' image has been obliterated, apparently by hammering.<b><a href="#N_5_">[[5]]</a></b></p>
<p>  Despite his disapproval of the marriage, the Patriarch Sergius performed the ceremony himself
and crowned Martina in the Augustaeum after she was proclaimed Augusta by <a href="heraclis.html"><b>Heraclius</b></a>.
According to Nicephorus, the patriarch attempted to put pressure on<a href="heraclis.html"><b> Heraclius</b></a> by writing to him
and admonishing him to repudiate Martina. In reply, the emperor excused himself: 'What you say
is very well. The obligation you owe me as high priest and friend you have already paid. For the
rest, the responsibility shall lie on me.'<b><a href="#N_6_">[[6]]</a></b> The popular reaction too was markedly unfavourable and
news of the marriage was greeted in the hippodrome with insults even by the Greens, 
<a href="heraclis.html"><b>Heraclius'</b></a>
favoured faction.<b><a href="#N_7_">[[7]]</a></b> Members of the imperial family also voiced their objections, with <a href="heraclis.html"><b>Heraclius'</b></a>
brother (and Martina's uncle) Theodore continually criticising <a href="heraclis.html"><b>Heraclius</b></a> because of this
relationship and saying 'his sin is continually before him'. This insult was a double-edged one, not
only targetting the incestuous marriage but highlighting Martina's unconventional habit of
travelling with <a href="heraclis.html"><b>Heraclius</b></a> and the army.<b><a href="#N_8_">[[8]]</a></b></p>
<p><a href="heraclis.html"><b> Heraclius</b></a> and Martina were clearly a very close couple: seldom apart, they had at least ten
children, though the names and order of these children are questions for debate: they seem to have
included Fabius, Theodosius, Constantine, <a href="heraclon.html"><b> Heraclius (Heraclonas),</b></a> David (Tiberius), Martinus or
Marinus, Augustina, Anastasia and/or Martina, and Febronia. Of these at least two were
handicapped, which was seen as punishment for the illegality of the marriage: Fabius, the eldest,
had a paralysed neck and the second, Theodosius, was a deaf-mute.<b><a href="#N_9_">[[9]]</a></b> Even when pregnant
Martina accompanied <a href="heraclis.html"><b>Heraclius</b></a>, and <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Heraclonas</b></a>, perhaps her fourth child, was born at Lazica in
626 while <a href="heraclis.html"><b>Heraclius</b></a> was on campaign against the Persians, and was with him at Antioch (with a
child), when the news was received of the serious defeat by the Arabs at the river <a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;an_ya636.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=471&quot;)"><b>Yarmuk </b></a>in
August 636.<b><a href="#N_10_">[[10]]</a></b></p>
<center><h3>Martina as empress-consort</h3></center>
<p>  Like many a step-mother Martina was concerned to secure some part of the succession for her
own children, and her relationship with the well-liked <b>Constantine</b>, who had been co-emperor
since 613, was a stormy one: she was after all both his step-mother and his first cousin, which
cannot have made matters any easier. <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Heraclonas</b></a> was the eldest of her children eligible for the
throne (deformity acted as a barrier), and in 632 at the age of six or thereabouts he was
proclaimed Caesar by his half-brother during <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Constantine's</b></a> consulship, a sign that he was next in
line for the throne.<b><a href="#N_11_">[[11]]</a></b></p>
<p>A plot in 637 may have been influenced by her manoeuvres on behalf of her children: the plotters
included <a href="heraclis.html"><b>Heraclius'</b></a> illegitimate son Atalarichus and his nephew Theodore: the noses and hands of
all conspirators were cut off, one of Theodore's legs was also amputated, and they were exiled to
Prinkipo.<b><a href="#N_12_">[[12]]</a></b> One of the consequences was that Martina's son <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Heraclonas (officially Heraclius II)</b></a>
was crowned emperor in July 638, and his younger brother David made Caesar: <a href="heraclis.html"><b>Heraclius</b></a> also
had his daughters Augustina and Anastasia pronounced Augustae.<b><a href="#N_13_">[[13]]</a></b> The situation was
exacerbated because <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Constantine</b></a> may already have been suffering from ill-health, while the elder
of <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Constantine's</b></a> two sons, another Heraclius, was then only seven years of age. The political
situation was therefore tense and Martina's children were clearly in a position to make a move on
the throne in the event of anything happening to <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Constantine</b></a>.</p>
<center><h3>Mother and Empress</h3></center>
<p>  Early in 641 <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Heraclius</b></a> made a will, not leaving the empire to <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Constantine</b></a> his eldest son as his
undisputed successor, but providing for his sons <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Constantine</b></a> and <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Heraclonas</b></a> (Constantine III and
Heraclius II) to be emperors of equal rank. Martina was to be honoured by them as 'mother and
empress'.<b><a href="#N_14_">[[14]]</a></b> <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Constantine</b></a> at this time was twenty-eight years of age with two sons of his own, and
yet had his fifteen-year old half-brother associated with him, while Martina was clearly to have
some authority in government, not just as a regent figure but as a ruler in her own right.
 <a href="heraclis.html"><b>Heraclius</b></a> was within his rights in nominating two of his sons as co-rulers, but the decision was
not a popular one, the situation being complicated by the terminal illness suffered by <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Constantine</b></a>.
In the event of <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Constantine's</b></a> death the throne was now to pass to his half-brother by Martina, and
not his own two sons. As a result, strife within the capital, based on the factions of the two
emperors and popular hatred of Martina, continued to grow. </p>
<p><a href="heraclis.html"><b>Heraclius</b></a> died on 11 February 641 of dropsy. The incestuous nature of his marriage was still not
forgotten, and Nicephorus considers <a href="heraclis.html"><b>Heraclius'</b></a> final illness (in which his private parts turned
around and discharged the urine in his face, unless he placed a board against his abdomen) as
punishment for his transgression in marrying his niece.<b><a href="#N_15_">[[15]]</a></b> After his three-day lying-in-state and
burial in the Church of the Holy Apostles, his will was made public by Martina herself in an
unheard-of show of authority by an empress.  She summoned the patriarch Pyrrhus, the senate and
other dignitaries and called an assembly of the people in the hippodrome to show them the
testament of <a href="heraclis.html"><b>Heraclius</b></a> and the provisions for herself and <a href="heraclis.html"><b>Heraclius'</b></a> sons. This took place in the
absence of <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Constantine</b></a> and <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Heraclonas</b></a>, for the populace's first reaction was to insist that they be
brought out. She proceded to demand, as empress, first place in the empire (in other words to
assume authority herself); the crowd in contrast made their wishes for an emperor, <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Constantine</b></a> in
particular as senior emperor, very plain: 'You have the honour due to the mother of the
 emperors, but they that of our emperors and
lords.... Nor can you, O Lady, receive barbarians or other foreign emissaries who come 
to the
palace or converse with them. May God forbid that the Roman State should come to such a pass!'
And they came down from their seats acclaiming the emperors. When Martina had heard these
things, she withdrew to her palace.<b><a href="#N_16_">[[16]]</a></b></p>
<p>This objection to her participation in government was in direct opposition to Martina's own
plans, and she was clearly unhappy at this turn in events, though not without a further agenda.
 <a href="heraclis.html"><b>Heraclius</b></a> had apparently before his death given Martina a private 
sum of money, left in the care
of the patriarch Pyrrhus for her protection in case<a href="heraclon.html"><b> Constantine</b></a> should evict her from the palace.
This money <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Constantine</b></a> now forced Pyrrhus to disgorge, perhaps because the empire was in such
dire financial straits. His supporters feared action against him on the part of Martina and
<a href="heraclon.html"><b>Heraclonas</b></a>, and the treasurer Philagrius advised him to write to the army, informing them that he
was dying and asking for their assistance in protecting the rights of his children. He also sent a
vast sum of money, more than two million <i>solidi</i> (gold coins), to Valentinus, an adjutant of
Philagrius, to distribute to the soldiers to persuade them to secure the succession for his sons after
his death.<b><a href="#N_17_">[[17]]</a></b></p>
<p>As expected, <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Constantine</b></a> was soon to die, after only ruling for 103 days, according to
Nicephorus. His death, probably from tuberculosis,<b><a href="#N_18_">[[18]]</a></b> perhaps took place on 24 May 641.<b><a href="#N_19_">[[19]]</a></b> The
belief that Martina had poisoned him was rampant, and was later officially propagated by
Constantine's son <a href="constan2.html"><b>Heraclius</b></a> (who ruled as <a href="constan2.html"><b>Constans II</b></a>). The patriarch Pyrrhus is often mentioned
as her accomplice. Theophanes, for example, states: 'when Heraclius had died and his son
Constantine became emperor, Pyrrhus along with Martina killed him by poison.'<b><a href="#N_20_">[[20]]</a></b> It is unclear
why Pyrrhus would have been involved, unless because he felt that <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Constantine</b></a> was not properly
supportive of monotheletism, a doctrine propounded (unsuccessfully) by <a href="heraclis.html"><b>Heraclius</b></a> in an attempt
to heal the breach between orthodox and monophysites: Pyrrhus, appointed by <a href="heraclis.html"><b>Heraclius</b></a> on
Sergius' death in 638, was, like Martina, a fervent monothelete.</p>
<center><h3>Martina's regency</h3></center>
<p><a href="heraclon.html"><b>Heraclonas</b></a>, aged fifteen years, then succeeded to the throne, though the <i>de facto</i> ruler was of
course his mother Martina.<b><a href="#N_21_">[[21]]</a></b> John of Nikiu records that the entire clergy was opposed to the new
regime, declaring, 'it is not fitting that one derived from a reprobate seed should sit on the
imperial throne: rather it is the sons of Constantine, who was the son of Eudocia, that should bear
sway over the empire.'<b><a href="#N_22_">[[22]]</a></b> Donatives were given to the army to ensure its loyalty,<b><a href="#N_23_">[[23]]</a></b> and unpopular
punitive measures taken against <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Constantine's</b></a> supporters, including the treasurer Philagrius, who
was tonsured (made a monk) and exiled. The monothelete ecclesiastical policy was also revived,
and Cyrus the monothelete bishop of Alexandria was recalled from exile and sent back to
Egypt.<b><a href="#N_24_">[[24]]</a></b></p>
<p> Martina's unpopularity -- with the clergy, the factions, the populace, the senate, and the army
-- now reached an all-time low. Valentinus Arshakuni, a general of Armenian descent and
Philagrius' adjutant, who had been appointed commander-in-chief of the East by <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Constantine</b></a>, now
fired the soldiery against Martina and her regime.<b><a href="#N_25_">[[25]]</a></b> Following <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Constantine's</b></a> instructions he
distributed the money sent by Philagrius and prevailed on the troops throughout the provinces to
act against Martina and her sons and ignore the empress' orders, as well as orchestrating a march
on Constantinople.<b><a href="#N_26_">[[26]]</a></b> Martina and <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Heraclonas</b></a> held the capital securely, but Valentinus advanced
as far as Chalcedon, where he remained, supposedly in order to assist the interests of <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Constantine's</b></a>
children, though there were concerns that he had designs on the throne on his own account.<b><a href="#N_27_">[[27]]</a></b> In
September 641, due to pressure caused by the army's presence, the young <a href="constan2.html"><b>Heraclius</b></a>,
<a href="heraclon.html"><b>Constantine's</b></a> son, now aged ten, was crowned in St Sophia by <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Heraclonas</b></a> and renamed
Constantine by the populace (as emperor he was known as Constans).<b><a href="#N_28_">[[28]]</a> </b>Rioting, however,
continued in the city and that same evening the mob, with 'Jews and other unbelievers', broke into
the sanctuary of St Sophia and attempted to assault the patriarch Pyrrhus, unpopular because of
his support of Martina. Pyrrhus resigned his office on the following day, 29 September 641,
according to Nicephorus, and left for Carthage.<b><a href="#N_29_">[[29]]</a></b> In an attempt to defuse the situation further,
<a href="heraclon.html"><b>Heraclonas</b></a> and Martina came to an agreement with Valentinus, and appointed him <u>comes
excubitorum</u>, promising he would not be called to account for the money received from
<a href="heraclon.html"><b>Constantine</b></a>. In addition his soldiers would be rewarded with gold. At the same time Martina's
younger son David was crowned as third co-emperor (lessening <a href="constan2.html"><b>Constantine/Constans'</b></a> status as
co-emperor and heir) and renamed Tiberius.<b><a href="#N_30_">[[30]]</a></b></p>
<center><h3>Downfall</h3></center>
<p> Shortly afterwards the people of the capital revolted against <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Heraclonas</b></a> and Martina. The senate
seems to have played an important role in events but the rebellion may also have been sparked off
by further trouble with the army, and been directed by Valentinus. John of Nikiu's account is not
entirely reliable, but he tells us that the hatred between the two emperors (by which he presumably
means their factions) continued to grow and that Satan sowed dissension between <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Heraclonas</b></a> and
the army, which must have continued to consider itself a champion of the rights of <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Constantine's</b></a>
children. The troops in Cappadocia committed atrocities, and produced a letter supposedly sent by
Martina and Pyrrhus to David the 'Matarguem' (perhaps a logothete) to make 'a vigorous war,
and to take Martina to be his wife, and to put down the sons of Constantine'. This letter, though
possibly a forgery, was used as a catalyst for further trouble and John tells us that as a
consequence all the soldiers and people in the capital rose up and a large force marched to the
capital, captured the palace and had Martina and her three sons -- <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Heraclonas</b></a>, David and
Martinus -- 'escorted forth with insolence'. They were stripped of the imperial crown, their noses
cut off (so that they could not attempt to regain the throne) and sent in exile to Rhodes; the
youngest son, presumably Martinus, was castrated, but Theodosius, the second son, was left
unharmed because he was a deaf-mute. According to Theophanes, <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Heraclonas'</b></a> nose was cut off
and Martina's tongue. The seventh-century Armenian source, Sebeos, states that Martina's tongue
was cut out and then she and her two sons were killed.<b><a href="#N_31_">[[31]]</a></b> Whatever the details, it was the end of
Martina's involvement in political life, and she seems to have spent the rest of her life in exile.</p>
<p>The young emperor, <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Constantine's</b></a> son and <a href="heraclis.html"><b>Heraclius'</b></a> grandson, was now known as <a href="constan2.html"><b>Constans </b></a>(a
diminutive of Constantine) and reigned as Constans II (641-68). Constans did not assume real
power until about 650 and <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Heraclonas'</b></a> and Martina's downfall was obviously orchestrated by
those who assumed power on behalf of this branch of <a href="heraclis.html"><b>Heraclius'</b></a> family, most notably Valentinus,
who appears to have tried to acquire the throne for himself and who married his daughter <a href="faustaii.html"><b>Fausta</b></a>
to the young emperor. Certainly he played a part in removing supporters of Martina from their
positions,<b><a href="#N_32_">[[32]]</a></b> and many of the policies of her six-month period of rule were reversed.</p>
<h3>Views of Martina</h3>
<p>Later opinions of Martina and her government were invariably hostile. Theophanes quotes a
speech supposedly made to the senate by <a href="constan2.html"><b>Constans</b></a> on his accession in 641/2 in which he thanks
the senators for their part in overthrowing his uncle and Martina, and condemns Martina's past
actions: </p>
<p> 'My father Constantine, who begot me, reigned for a considerable time in the lifetime of his
father... and, after his death, for a very short time; for the envy of his stepmother Martina both cut
off his fair hopes and deprived him of life, and this on account of Heraclonas, her illicit offspring
by Heraclius. Your godly decision rightly cast her out from the imperial dignity along with her
child lest the Roman Empire appeared to be ruled in an unlawful manner.'<b><a href="#N_33_">[[33]]</a></b></p>
<p>Empress-regents henceforth play a very understated role in government, until the time of the
empress <a href="irene.html"><b>Irene</b></a> in 780. Whether <a href="constan2.html"><b>Constans'</b></a> mother, <a href="gegoria.html"><b>Gregoria</b></a>, widow of <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Constantine III</b></a>, played a
part in overseeing the first years of her young son's rule is a moot point. Presumably she did --
although her influence is never mentioned. And yet she was a family member in her own right, as
the daughter of <a href="heraclis.html"><b>Heraclius'</b></a> cousin Niketas, and thus had married her own second cousin.<b><a href="#N_34_">[[34]]</a></b>  
Doubtless she had learnt from Martina the dangers which could attend popular perceptions of an
intriguing empress-mother and kept her head down.</p>
<p>Martina's marriage to her uncle and her ambition for her family had inspired implacable
resentment among the people of Constantinople. Her attempt to sideline <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Constantine III</b></a>, who had
been co-emperor since 613, and take over the reins of government in her own right on <a href="heraclis.html"><b>Heraclius'</b></a>
death, as <a href="heraclis.html"><b>Heraclius</b></a> had himself laid down in his will, was thwarted by concerted popular
opposition. She was perfectly within her rights to rule on behalf of her underage son <a href="heraclon.html"><b>Heraclonas</b></a>,
but to achieve his accession she was widely believed to have deliberately poisoned her stepson.
She was probably seen as one of those persons responsible for removing God's favour from the
empire, which was so clearly evidenced in the sweeping Arab victories from 636 onwards. Hated
and feared by her contemporaries, Martina's career was to affect perceptions of empress-regents
and their role for a considerable period. </p>
