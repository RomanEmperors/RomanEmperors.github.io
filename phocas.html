<h3>
<b>Phocas (602-610 A.D.)</b></h3></center>

<center><b>Kevin H. Crow</b>
<br><b>Western Kentucky University</b></center>

<p>Phocas was, and to a certain extent remains, one of the most maligned
of all Byzantine emperors. Reasoning that "speaking of suffering is itself
suffering," the Byzantine historian George of Pisidia thought it better
to avoid mentioning Phocas' name whenever possible.<b><a href="#N_1_">[[1]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
On those occasions when he did refer to Phocas, George of Pisidia used
such unflattering titles as "the terrestrial leviathan" and "the Gorgon-faced."<b><a href="#N_2_">[[2]]
</a></b>The Byzantine author Theophlact Simocatta was just as unkind. Among
other things Theophlact called Phocas a barbarian half-breed, a Cyclops
and a Centaur.<b><a href="#N_3_">[[3]]</a></b>&nbsp; Theophlact and George
of Pisidia both claimed that Phocas was the origin of all of the calamities
that continued to plague the empire in their own day.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this
respect the two historians were not unique. Later generations of Byzantine
authors also viewed Phocas in a negative manner. The ninth-century historian
Theophanes and his contemporary the Patriarch Nicephorus continued to trace
the origins of the empire's decline back to Phocas, as did the tenth-century
Leo the Grammarian and the eleventh-century George Cedrenus.<b><a href="#N_4_">[[4]]</a></b>
</p><p>For the most part, moderns have been as unkind in their treatment of
Phocas as their Byzantine predecessors. Prominent scholars such as J. B.
Bury, A. Pernice and R. Sprinter not only defend Byzantine authors' assessments
of the emperor, but add their own invectives against Phocas as well - referring
to him as "a shapeless monster" and concluding that he was "the most perverse
and ferocious tyrant that ever donned the imperial diadem."<b><a href="#N_5_">[[5]]</a></b>Others
have blamed Phocas for everything from the institutional breakdown of the
empire to indirectly causing the Moslem conquests.<b><a href="#N_6_">[[6]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Before one can make a valid assessment of Phocas's reign, however, it is
necessary to understand both the state of the empire when Phocas came to
power and the motivations of those who recorded the events of his reign.&nbsp;
By the time of his death in 565, <b><a href="justinia.html">Justinian</a></b>
had come closer than any other Byzantine emperor to reconstituting the
old Roman Empire. He had reestablished imperial authority in Italy, Africa,
and part of Spain. The empire and its subjects, however, benefited far
less than <b><a href="justinia.html">Justinian</a></b> had hoped from these
conquests. Hindsight, in fact, reveals that the ambitious emperor had dangerously
overestimated the empire's capabilities.
</p><p>During the thirty-seven years separating his reign from that of Phocas,
it became clear that, in return for momentary glory, <b><a href="justinia.html">Justinian</a></b>
had bestowed upon his successors the arduous burden of managing an over-extended
empire whose resources he had drained and whose institutions and infrastructure
proved too weak to meet the task at hand. Though <b><a href="justinia.html">Justinian's</a></b>
immediate successor <b><a href="justinii.html">Justin II </a></b>(565-78)
realized that his predecessor had stretched the empire's finances to the
limit, he refused to concede any of the territories that <b><a href="justinia.html">Justinian</a></b>
had conquered.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, <b><a href="justinii.html">Justin</a></b>
attempted to cut costs by refusing to pay subsidies to the Avars - a troublesome
people whom <b><a href="justinia.html">Justinian</a></b> had found easier
to pay off than to fight. While <b><a href="justinii.html">Justin's</a></b>
policy towards the Avars had no immediate consequences, in the long run
it proved disastrous. Cut off from Byzantine funds, the Avars in search
of new sources of wealth made an alliance with the Lombards, who themselves
had been traditional allies of the Byzantines. The two peoples then proceeded
to attack the Gepids - a people whose lands bordered Byzantine territory
- and seize control of their lands. Having enriched themselves at the expense
of the Gepids, the Avars became a powerful force on the Danube. Soon the
Avars would begin an inconclusive war with the Byzatines and would remain
a dangerous foe for many years to come.
</p><p>The Balkans, however, was not the only frontier that proved to be a
problem for <b><a href="justinii.html">Justin</a></b>. Very early in his
reign, virtually every region that <b><a href="justinia.html">Justinian</a></b>
had brought under imperial control came under attack. The Visigoths began
attacking Byzantine territories in Spain, the Lombards began attacking
Byzantine lands in Italy, and the Moors began attacking Byzantine lands
in Africa. <b><a href="justinii.html">Justin</a></b> neither significantly
reinforced these areas under attack nor withdrew from them. Instead, <b><a href="justinii.html">Justin</a></b>,
like his predecessor, sought to expand the empire in a new direction. After
listening to appeals from Armenians under Persian rule who were plotting
a rebellion and consulting with tribes who were already raiding northern
Persia, <b><a href="justinii.html">Justin</a></b> decided to invade Persian
territory in 572. By late 573 the Persians had not only defeated the invading
Byzantine force, but had also launched a formidable counterattack and soon
took the key Byzantine stronghold at Dara. This defeat proved too much
for <b><a href="justinii.html">Justin</a></b> and reportedly drove him insane.
</p><p><b><a href="justinii.html">Justin's</a></b> successors proved no more
adept at coping with the problems plaguing the empire. Though <b><a href="justinii.html">Justin</a></b>
had miscalculated the effects that a war against Persia would have on the
empire, he had at least proved to be a better administer of the imperial
treasury than <b><a href="justinia.html">Justinian</a></b>. Thus, while
Justin's successor, <b><a href="ticonii.html">Tiberius</a></b> (578-582),
inherited an empire plagued by enemies on all fronts, at least his predecessor
had left him an empire whose treasury was not as over-extended as its frontiers.
<b><a href="ticonii.html">Tiberius</a></b>
at once employed the ample resources of the empire to pay off the Avars
and prevent the Lombards from consolidating their power by inducing some
of their dukes to block the election of a new king. Even after achieving
these goals, <b><a href="ticonii.html">Tiberius</a></b> failed to restore
total peace in the empire's European territories; for the Slavs had begun
to raid Illyricum and before his reign ended they had invaded Greece and
reached the city of Athens. Nevertheless, having achieved a temporary truce
with the Avars and the Lombards, <b><a href="ticonii.html">Tiberius</a></b>
could concentrate on fighting the Persians. <b><a href="ticonii.html">Tiberius's</a></b>
able general, the count of the Excubitors, <b><a href="mauricius.html">Maurice</a></b>,
defeated the Persians and forced them to retreat to Dara. <b><a href="mauricius.html">Maurice</a></b>,
however, was unable to follow up this victory because he had to rush back
to Constantinople where <b><a href="ticonii.html">Tiberius</a></b> lay mortally
ill. Not having a son to whom to leave the empire, <b><a href="ticonii.html">Tiberius</a></b>
had <b><a href="mauricius.html">Maurice</a></b> (582-602) crowned Augustus
the day before his death.
</p><p><b><a href="ticonii.html">Tiberius</a></b>, like his predecessor, had
neglected to address the problems that had plagued the empire for decades
by reforming its institutions and infrastructure. Instead he had opted
to achieve temporary relief by paying off key enemies. <b><a href="mauricius.html">Maurice</a></b>,
therefore, inherited an empire not much securer, and much less poorer than
the one <b><a href="ticonii.html">Tiberius </a></b>had inherited from<b><a href="justinii.html">
Justin</a></b>. <b><a href="mauricius.html">Maurice</a></b> quickly realized
that in order to insure the empire's security he would have to deal with
three major threats - the Persians along the eastern frontier, the Lombards
in Italy, and the Slavs in the Balkans. In addition, by spring 583 the
Avars were demanding an increase in the subsidy that the Byzantines had
paid them during the reign of Tiberius. Thus, <b><a href="mauricius.html">Maurice</a></b>
found himself facing the dilemma of having to fight at least three (and
possibly four) major wars, but having the financial and manpower resources
to fight only one.
<br>Understanding his financial bind and fearing that giving in to the
Avars' insistence for a larger subsidy might encourage further extortion,
<b><a href="mauricius.html">Maurice</a></b>
at first refused to acquiesce to their demands. Unfortunately, this only
prompted the Avars to invade the empire and after losing a few cities to
them <b><a href="mauricius.html">Maurice
</a></b>agreed to increase the
subsidy by the amount that the Avars had demanded.
</p><p><b><a href="mauricius.html">Maurice's</a></b> attempts to cut costs in
other ways proved even more dangerous. Having temporarily bought off the
Avars,<b><a href="mauricius.html"> Maurice</a></b> was able to transfer
enough soldiers to the east to swing the war against the Persians in his
favor. However, when the emperor sought to cut costs by supplying his troops
directly with arms instead of giving them the usual generous arms allowance
- effectively cutting their pay by a fourth - the army rebelled. The army's
discipline was eventually restored when the troops finally received their
full pay. This episode provided <b><a href="mauricius.html">Maurice</a></b>
with a key lesson concerning the importance of maintaining the favor of
the army. Unfortunately it was a lesson that <b><a href="mauricius.html">Maurice</a></b>
would fail to remember.
</p><p>In the meantime fortune shifted in favor of <b><a href="mauricius.html">Maurice</a></b>.
A Persian general named Varahran, who had been humiliated by the Persian
King Hormisdas, marched against his former lord and defeated an army sent
to stop him. Hearing of this defeat, the Persian nobility overthrew Hormisdas
and replaced him with his son Chosroes II. In turn Chosroes was driven
out of Persia by Varahran, who seized the crown for himself. Chosroes pleaded
with <b><a href="mauricius.html">Maurice</a></b> to help him regain his
crown. In return for his aid Chosroes offered to surrender to the Byzantines
most of Persian Armenia and to return the cities of Dara and Martyopolis.
Although the Balkans were still occupied by Slavs and the threat of the
Avars remained, <b><a href="mauricius.html">Maurice</a></b> agreed to help
Chosroes regain his crown. The venture proved to be a great success for
<b><a href="mauricius.html">Maurice</a></b>.
Chosroes was returned to power, the Byzantines received the territories
promised them and peace was secured on the eastern frontier.
</p><p>Fresh from his victory along the eastern frontier <b><a href="mauricius.html">Maurice</a></b>
sought to pacify other troublesome areas of the empire and decided to move
first against the Slavs in the Balkans. As usual, however, the emperor
quickly found himself short on the resources needed to conduct war. Realizing
that he could not afford to economize on rations, he once again attempted
to cut the pay of his soldiers. In the end, in order to prevent another
mutiny, the emperor was forced to increase the pay of the army. Faced with
this added expense, <b><a href="mauriciua.html">Maurice </a></b>realized
that he could only fight one war at a time and chose not to reinforce other
areas of the empire until the Balkans were secure. Byzantine forces in
Africa, facing a renewed threat from the Moors, and Byzantine forces in
Italy, facing a renewed threat from the Lombards, were therefore left to
fend for themselves.&nbsp; Even after <b><a href="mauricius.html">Maurice's</a></b>
generals had achieved victory over the Slavs the Balkans were not completely
pacified. While Byzantine forces were dispersed over the Balkans mopping
up remaining pockets of Slav resistance, the Avars once again invaded the
region. Unable to concentrate their forces quickly enough to mount an effective
defense, the Byzantines were quickly pushed back most of the way to Constantinople.
Fortunately for the Byzantines, plague soon broke out among the Avars and
its devastating effects, along with <b><a href="mauricius.html">Maurice's</a></b>
promise to raise the tribute the empire paid to them, convinced the Avar
Kagan to make peace with the Byzantines.
</p><p>Although <b><a href="mauricius.html">Maurice </a></b>managed to raise
the tribute promised to the Avars, the task proved difficult because the
plague had not only broken out among the Avars but in Constantinople, Anatolia,
Italy, Africa and other regions of the empire as well. Despite the added
financial burdens that the plague had placed on the empire, he decided
to strike back at the Avars while they were still suffering from the plague.
The campaign against the Avars proved to be successful. Finally, <b><a href="mauricius.html">Maurice</a></b>
had managed to push the empire's enemies across the Danube. The cost of
this operation, however, had been enormous. And in order to keep the Avars
and Slavs from crossing the Danube again it proved necessary to maintain
a large force along its banks. This added expense was one that he found
difficult to afford. In addition, in 602 a famine broke out in Constatinople
and set off rioting throughout the city. This calamity served as a graphic
reminder that the empire's resources had been stretched to the breaking
point. In order to economize <b><a href="mauricius.html">Maurice</a></b>
once again attempted to cut military expenses. The emperor decided that
in order to save on rations and ration allowances he would order the soldiers
along the Danube to cross the river, where they were to winter in Slavic
territory and live off the land. This decision proved fatal for Maurice<b><a href="#N_7_">.[[7]]</a></b>The
army mutinied and within a short time its representative, a junior officer
by named Phocas, replaced Maurice as emperor.
</p><p>In some ways it is not surprising that Byzantine historians portray
Phocas as a villain. He had been, after all, a usurper with no legitimate
dynastic claim to the throne. The same of course could be said of his successor
<b><a href="heraclis.html">Heraclius.</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The difference between the two being that <b><a href="heraclis.html">Heraclius</a></b>
was able to hold on to power and establish a new dynasty, while Phocas
was not. Historians are rarely kind to losers. The two most notable authors
of <b><a href="heraclis.html">Heraclius's </a></b>reign, Theophylact Simocatta
and George of Pisidia, make very little mention of Phocas. As noted previously,
when they did make mention of him the two authors always employed the harshest
tools of literary invective. After all, the greater the villain that they
could make out of Phocas, the easier it became for these authors to portray
their own patron as savior and hero. For Theophylact, George of Pisidia
and subsequent Greek authors, Phocas became the primary source for all
of the calamities that befell the Byzantine Empire in the years following
his reign. Greek authors, however, offered virtually no explanation other
than moral for how Phocas brought about such calamities. Certainly the
most cited source for Phocas's reign, the ninth-century <i>Chronicle</i>
of Theophanes, treats Phocas in this manner. As one recent scholar demonstrates,
in his treatment of Phocas, Theophanes took great care to re-work his own
sources in order "to create drama and express moral causation.<b><a href="#N_8_">[[8]]</a></b>
</p><p>Fortunately for modern scholars, the invective histories of various
Greek authors are not the only sources for Phocas's reign that remain.
Early in Phocas's reign Pope Gregory I and the future Patriarch of Jerusalem,
Sophronius, heaped praise after praise on the usurper. And the saintly
status of these authors insured that their works would survive <b><a href="heraclis.html">Heraclius's</a></b><i>damnatio
memoriae</i> of Phocas. In addition there also remain a number of Syriac
writings that make mention of important events surrounding Phocas's reign.
Unlike their Greek counterparts, the authors of these Syriac sources tended
to belong to various "non-orthodox" sects, including Monophysite and Nestorian
Christians.<b><a href="#N_9_">[[9]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Not surprisingly,
these Syrian authors provide moderns with details lacking in the Greek
sources.
</p><p>Phocas did not begin his career as a villain. Even his bitterest critics
like Theophylact grudgingly admit that the mob cheered his triumphal entry
into Constantinople following his successful coup.<b><a href="#N_10_">[[10]]</a></b>
Pope Gregory I praised the new emperor as an instrument of God who lifted
the "yoke of tribulation" <b><a href="mauricius.html">(Maurice)</a></b>
from the necks of the empire's citizens.<b><a href="#N_11_">[[11]]</a></b>
Such adulation, however, was not to last; for Phocas soon found himself
plagued with the same sorts of crises that had brought down his predecessor
and was forced to rely, either by necessity or lack of creativity, on the
same weak institutions that had already proven inadequate for the tasks
at hand.&nbsp; The problems resulting from overextension that Byzantine
rulers faced along the frontiers of their empire have been addressed above
in ample detail. In order to appreciate fully the difficulties faced by
Phocas it is now necessary to examine the intrinsic weaknesses of the institutions
on which the new emperor depended in order to maintain his, and the empire's,
security.
</p><p>In the past a number of prominent scholars have suggested that the senatorial
elite in Constantinople was similar in composition and power to its counterpart
in the West - i.e. it was a powerful land-owning aristocracy capable of
offering key challenges to imperial authority.<b><a href="#N_12_">[[12]]</a></b>
Recent scholarship has demonstrated that this was far from true. The wealth
of the landed aristocracy in the east never came near to their counter-parts
in the west and their estates never dominated the economy of the eastern
Mediterranean as those of their Roman counterparts had in the west.<b><a href="#N_13_">[[13]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To the contrary, throughout the period small plots held and worked by free
peasants continued to play a key role in the economy of the region.<b><a href="#N_14_">[[14]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Far from being a major power broker in imperial politics, the elite of
Constantinople was primarily made up of appointees of the emperor, heavily
(if not totally) dependent on his patronage, and, therefore, unlikely to
offer any real independent political opposition to him. This system of
imperial patronage was in truth a spoils system in which loyalty counted
more than capability. Since, in the realm of politics, blood is often thicker
than water, it comes as no surprise that relatives of the emperor benefited
the most from imperial patronage - receiving appointments to key positions
in the imperial bureaucracy. In sixth and early seventh century Byzantium,
the safety of the dynasty at Constantinople counted for more than an efficient
bureaucracy or a secure frontier.
</p><p>Insuring a loyal aristocracy at Constantinople was not the only measure
that Phocas and his sixth century predecessors took in order to insure
their security. For some time one of the most volatile of the Constantinopolitan
political groups had been the <i>demes</i>. Drawn from various quarters
of Constantinople and representing the interests of the social classes
from these respective areas, the demes were a force that Byzantine emperors
both utilized and feared.<b><a href="#N_15_">[[15]]</a></b> Desiring to
prevent another incident like the Nika revolt that occurred during <b><a href="justinia.html">Justinian's</a></b>
reign, late sixth century Byzantine emperors made use of demarchs - administrators
that they appointed over each deme to oversee their activities and provide
some measure of control. Thus, having established a fair degree of control
over the Constantinopolitan aristocracy and masses, sixth century emperors,
surrounded by the immense walls encircling the capital, became lulled into
a false sense of security.
</p><p>While <b><a href="justinia.html">Justinian's</a></b> successors had been
able to maintain a firm grip on the capital, their hold on the provinces
proved far less secure. Many in the provinces, because of the heavy taxes
it imposed and the imposition of billeting troops, despised the central
government. Religious disputes provided an even greater source of conflict
between provincials and the central government. Since the secular bureaucracy
had largely collapsed by the end of the sixth century, the central government
increasingly came to rely on the hierarchy of the Orthodox clergy to administer
the provinces. However, conflict between the Chalcedonian officials sent
from Constantinople and Monophysite majorities in the Syrian countryside
and throughout Egypt was always tense and occasionally resulted in violence.<b><a href="#N_16_">[[16]]</a></b>
The final years of <b><a href="mauricius.html">Maurice's</a></b> reign in
particular were marked by severe persecutions of Monophysites throughout
Syria and Egypt. This tactic in turn aroused intense anger against the
central government and the Chalcedonian clergy who enforced imperial policy.
Thus, the empire that Phocas seized from <b><a href="mauricius.html">Maurice</a></b>
was one whose authority in the provinces was represented by an unpopular
minority and enforced by military power.
</p><p>With the situation in the provinces already shaky when he came to power,
Phocas was quickly faced with a major threat along the eastern frontier
of the empire. Relations between Rome and Persia had remained good since
Maurice had helped Chosroes regain his crown. Since that time the Byzantines
had concentrated on reasserting their control of the Balkans, while Chosroes
had been preoccupied with suppressing a revolt in the eastern portion of
his empire. While the Byzantines had probably viewed Chosroes' return of
thier property and surrender of areas that had already rejected Persian
control as a moderate price to pay in return for their services in restoring
his crown, the Persian king himself most likely viewed these concessions
as a major blow to his dignity. By 602 the problems that Chosroes faced
in the east had been resolved and, with the overthrow of Maurice in November
of that same year, the Persian king now had an honorable pretext for attacking
the Byzantines. Presenting himself as the avenger of <b><a href="mauricius.html">Maurice's</a></b>
murder, Chosroes seized the opportunity to recover the areas that he had
earlier ceded to <b><a href="mauricius.html">Maurice</a></b> and in 603
launched an invasion against the Byzantines - beginning a war that would
last for over two decades and critically weaken both empires.
</p><p>As noted previously, Byzantine historians tended to be one-sided in
their treatment of Phocas. It should come as no surprise then that among
the many misdeeds attributed to Phocas was that he had been responsible
for subsequent losses to the Persians. A careful examination of the sources,
particularly Syrian and other provincial sources, however, reveals that
for the first few years of the war the Byzantines proved fairly effective
fighting against the Persians.<b><a href="#N_17_">[[17]]</a></b> In 609,
however, the war turned decisively in the Persians' favor when Phocas was
forced to withdraw most of the army from the frontier in order to deal
with a dangerous rebellion that had spread from the province of Africa
to Egypt.&nbsp; As a usurper with no dynastic ties to previous rulers,
Phocas's claim to the emperorship had always been shaky. Phocas immediately
sought to silence those who might voice concerns over his lack of dynastic
ties by requiring the previous emperor's father-in-law to renounce his
own claim to the throne. In effect, this move served as nothing less than
a formal renunciation of the principle of dynastic succession. Having countered
those who might question his lack of an imperial lineage, Phocas next moved
to legitimize his accession by portraying it as something that had been
divinely ordained. While previous Byzantine emperors had also justified
their acquisition of power as being in keeping with Divine will, few had
stressed this means of legitimizing their rule to the extent that Phocas
did.<b><a href="#N_18_">[[18]]&nbsp; </a></b>Phocas sought to advertise
his piety by contrasting his own reputation for orthodoxy with <b><a href="mauricius.html">Maurice's</a></b>
reputation for heterodoxy. In keeping with this strategy, upon taking power
Phocas publicly swore an oath of orthodoxy administered by the Patriarch
Cyriacus. To further demonstrate his piety, Phocas moved his Patriarchal
coronation to a church - something that would become a permanent fixture
in Byzantine ceremony.
</p><p>Ironically, Phocas's success in overthrowing his predecessor and establishing
himself as emperor despite his lack of dynastic ties prompted other ambitious
men with access to military forces to attempt the same against him. The
man who would eventually prove successful at replacing Phocas as emperor
was <b><a href="heraclis.html">Heraclius. Heraclius's</a></b> father - whose
name was also Heraclius - was the exarch (governor-general) of Africa.
Together the father and son, as consuls, staged a rebellion against Phocas
in 608. No doubt encouraged by the commitment of the imperial army against
the Persians, a rebel army invaded Egypt in the summer of 608. Having paved
the way for this invasion by bribing local garrison commanders and obtaining
the support of<b><a href="mauricius.html"> Maurice's </a></b>loyalists who
had been displaced by Phocas's appointees, <b><a href="heraclis.html">Heracliu</a></b>s
was confident that his supporters could achieve a quick victory in Egypt
and gain control of its riches and navy.&nbsp; In the end <b><a href="heraclis.html">Heraclius'
r</a></b>ebellion would expose the institutional weaknesses that had existed
in the Byzantine Empire for decades. Like his predecessors, Phocas relied
on safe, but largely incompetent, family members to man his bureaucracy
and oversee his armies. Similarly, successful generals were often relieved
and provincial administration was left in the hands of the dependable,
but unpopular and administratively ineffectual, Chalcedonian ecclesiastical
hierarchy.
</p><p>Shortly after <b><a href="heraclis.html">Heraclius's</a></b> forces entered
Egypt, riots broke out in cities throughout Egypt, Syria and Palestine.
Although sparked by news that a rebel army had marched into Egypt, these
riots do not appear to have been prearranged by <b><a href="heraclis.html">Heraclius's</a></b>
supporters. Instead, they resulted from the animosities that had festered
in the provinces for some time and which imperial authorities had foolishly
chosen to ignore.&nbsp; Understanding the gravity of the situation in Egypt,
yet caught in the same institutional bind that had faced his predecessor,
Phocas was forced to take a dangerous gamble. In order to crush the forces
that had risen against him, Phocas decided to withdraw his soldiers fighting



the Persians and send them against the rebels in Egypt. Not wishing to
leave the frontier completely vulnerable, Phocas's general Bonosus was
forced, for lack of options, to entrust the defense of the frontier to
one of the least reliable forces in the empire - the demes. Unlike in Constantinople,
where emperors had long ago reigned in these troublesome bodies by carefully
overseeing their administration, the imperial government had only recently
begun to institute reforms in the provincial demes. Thus, the demes that
Bonosus entrusted with the defense of the frontier were themselves hotbeds
of discontent, where deep animosities occasionally led to factional fighting.
</p><p>Once Bonosus reached Egypt a long, violent struggle ensued. The combatants
endured long sieges, fought pitched battles and atrocities were committed
by both sides<b>.</b><a href="#N_19_">[[19]]</a><b> </b>Locals used the
war as an excuse to settle long-held vendettas against their enemies as
rival factions sought to gain advantage by supporting one side or the other.
Egypt, however, was not the only region to succumb to factional fighting.
Deme violence broke out in Palestine as soon as Bonosus left the region
on his way to Egypt.&nbsp; The civil war in Egypt eventually came to an
end when <b><a href="heraclis.html">Heraclius's</a></b> supporters achieved
victory. The end of this struggle, however, came too late for the Byzantines
to salvage the situation along their frontier with Persia.&nbsp;&nbsp;
In 609, with the defense of their eastern borders entrusted to the unreliable
demes, Persian armies captured all of the Byzantines' key fortresses along
their frontier and drove the Byzantines from Armenia. Yet even these defeats
paled in comparison to the losses that the Byzantines would suffer in subsequent
years.&nbsp; While forces loyal to him were achieving victory in Egypt,
<b><a href="heraclis.html">Heraclius </a></b>made his way to Constantinople.
Hearing of the arrival of the usurper's fleet, Phocas quickly acted to
defend the city. Ironically, lacking any other options, Phocas relied on
the same sorts of forces to mount a defense of the capital as <b><a href="mauricius.html">Maurice</a></b>
had in 602. The Excubitors formed the heart of this force and were supported
by the demes.
</p><p>Like <b><a href="mauricius.html">Maurice</a></b>, Phocas had awarded
command of the Excubitors to an individual whom he thought he could trust
- his own son-in-law, Priscus. Priscus, who had himself come to power under
<b><a href="mauricius.html">Maurice</a></b>, however, was a true political
opportunist. Aware that Egypt had fallen to <b><a href="heraclis.html">Heraclius</a></b>
and witnessing the advance of the usurper's fleet, Priscus decided to betray
his father-in-law and switch his allegiance to <b><a href="heraclis.html">Heraclius</a></b>.
Without the support of the Excubitors, Phocas had virtually no chance to
save either his throne or his life. The deme known as the greens, whose
loyalty to Phocas had always been questionable, also threw its support
to the usurper and the other deme, the blues, proved as ineffectual as
ever as a military force.&nbsp; Deserted by his supporters, Phocas was
seized by the Excubitors, who brought him before <b><a href="heraclis.html">Heraclius</a></b>.
After cursing the fallen emperor, his self-appointed successor kicked Phocas
and beheaded him on the spot. Phocas's right arm and hand were then cut
off and his corpse was disemboweled, thrown into a skiff and burned<b>.<a href="#N_20_">[[20]]</a>
</b>Thus ended the career of the man who had shattered a record of stable
imperial succession that had lasted for nearly three hundred years and
who had brought to an end a line of rulers that dated back to <b><a href="connie.html">Constantine</a></b>.
</p><p>Phocas's usurpation certainly struck a blow to the principle of orderly
succession. Though Phocas's reign would eventually end in failure, the
importance of the innovations that he made to imperial imagery is demonstrated
by the fact that his own successor was quick to adopt the same strategies
that Phocas had to legitimize his own seizing of power. Like Phocas, <b><a href="heraclis.html">Heraclius</a></b>
would require one who had dynastic ties to his predecessor - Phocas's son-in-law,
Priscus - to renounce his own claim to the throne. And like Phocas, he
would portray his accession as a form of divine appointment.&nbsp; One
noted scholar recently ended his study of Maurice by citing a passage from
a Byzantine source claiming that the emperor's achievements could only
be appreciated in retrospect, when compared with the misfortunes of his
successor.<b><a href="#N_21_">[[21]]</a></b>
</p><p>Ironically, the same could be said of Phocas's reign. While left unchallenged,
Phocas proved capable of meeting a renewed threat from the Persians. <b><a href="heraclis.html">Heraclius's</a></b>
revolt, however, would mark a crucial turning point in Byzantine history.
Lasting over two years and costing thousands of lives, the revolt sapped
Byzantine manpower and finances and left the frontiers largely undefended.
This revolt would result in the loss of Syria, Palestine and Egypt to the
Persians. Although <b><a href="heraclis.html">Heraclius</a></b> would eventually
recover these areas, he would be able to hold on to them for only a brief
period of time. Soon these areas would be lost to a new force from the
east - the Muslims. Perhaps only when the Byzantines failed to successfully
meet this new challenge did they fully comprehend the damage that they
had sustained during the tumultuous events of the previous decades.<span class="text-2xl"></span>
