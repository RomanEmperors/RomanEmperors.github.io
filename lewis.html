<p>Dec 8, 2000

</p><p>Classical Studies are everywhere is under siege, and Cambridge is no 
exception.  The siege takes the form of the changing expectations that 
the University Instructor must hold for the incoming freshmen, and has 
its strongest focus on the special skills required for classical 
studies: ancient languages.  One might expect that the major problem 
would be college recruits who have no training in Greek and Latin, as 
is often the case in the USA.  This is to some extent true, although
it is somewhat alleviated at Cambridge and Oxford by the preponderance 
of students from privately funded schools that teach classical 
languages.  Most of the students still come with at least some Latin 
skills: in British terms, "A" level Latin is still the norm.  To deal 
with the growing number of students from less than first-class schools 
who have not received such training, as well as to widen the range of 
students able to attend first-rank universities, the Faculty of 
Classics has put in place intensive language courses.  The alternative 
is the unpalatable idea of offering degrees without the language 
requirement.  

</p><p>But the lack of basic language training is not the only problem at 
Cambridge and Oxford.  A more pervasive problem is often in the lack of 
basic historical skills.  Students may not know the century in which 
the Peloponnesian War, or the establishment of the Roman Principate, 
occurred.   Thus they need to catch up in these basic historical facts 
while attempting to advance their 2 or 3 years of language training 
into comprehensive reading of multiple classical texts.

</p><p>In the Cambridge system, the student is hard-pressed in several 
directions.  He must attend to a series of lectures and the writing of 
weekly essays on topics relating to those lectures.  The essays are 
reviewed by tutors, who meet with students alone or in groups of two or 
three.  The students focus on these essays, their principle means of
preparing for their written exams, and this focus sets limits on the 
amount of time available for language work.

</p><p>The students must also read an average of 12 set texts in their 
first year.  This is a mountain of reading and a lot of studying, 
especially when only one part of a wider curriculum.  For these reasons 
efficiency in reading is of prime importance.  One challenge to 
information technologies was to develop a tool that can facilitate the 
students' reading and help them to progress to a level at which they 
can truly use these languages. 

</p><p>A second task is to assist the student in finding and understanding 
the information required for the essays, and to prepare her for exams.  
This can be found in the programs such as Perseus, in which the student 
can contextualize historical information with language work and can 
come to see a particular historical period or event in a wider context 
of social history.

</p><p>Third, it is vital to bring these tools to the student in the dorm 
room at the college, and to do so in a way that is itself not 
time-consuming to set up.  The Faculty of Classics is a semi-autonomous 
institution at the University (the "Faculty" is the "Department"), at 
which students from the various colleges hear classical lectures, use 
the library and meet with the tutors.  But the students are themselves 
centered around the colleges, which are also semi-autonomous and which 
set many of their own rules and requirements.  It is unrealistic to 
expect the student to do the majority of language work at the Faculty 
itself.  It is a fact of life that much of this work must be done in 
the evening.  It is vital to bring the information to the student's 
room, and to have it available 24 hours a day.

</p><p>These requirements are important to the pedagogical method that the 
instructors use.  But Cambridge is also a leading research institution, 
and information technologies have important benefits for the 
researcher.  The need to augment information on hand for researchers, 
as well as for the talented final-year undergraduate who wants to 
deepen his penetration into the Ancient World, is increasing.  This 
means that industry-standard research tools must also be available in
every department office and in every dorm room.  But in addition to 
these standard tools, the Faculty is committed to making available 
certain resources that are unique to Cambridge.  In both pedagogical 
and research functions the same IT infrastructure and the same IT 
strategy is required. 

</p><p>My first task is to highlight the IT infrastructure investment that 
has been made by the Faculty. Staffing includes a full-time computer 
officer, who maintains hardware and software as well as writing 
special-purpose databases and programs.  Plans have been made for a 
second officer.  A graduate student classicist has been hired as a 
part-time Web Advisor to act as a liaison between the technical 
officers and classical scholars.  The primary task of the Web Advisor 
is to evaluate and upgrade the Web resources and make them more easily 
accessible by students and non-professionals as well as scholars.

</p><p>The Faculty's IT infrastructure includes some 100 networked IMac and 
PC computers, connected through two switched ethernet hubs to 4 
servers, including a CD server.  Transmission speed is 100-megabyte at 
the machine and 1-gigabyte between the hubs.  The Faculty network 
connects to the colleges and other university departments at 
100-megabyte speed.  Within the Faculty, and in its immediate 
connection to the outside world, the technology is in place to show 
movies and to do other functions requiring fast transmission rates.  
This often exceeds the speed of the ISPs that serve other universities.
At the present moment it exceeds the transmission speed of the network
connecting British educational institutions.

</p><p>The Classics Faculty also maintains three web servers, one each for 
the Classics Faculty and administration, the Museum of Classical Art 
and Archaeology, and for the Classics Library.  Each of the servers is 
maintained by a staff member in that particular field.  One of the 
tasks delegated to the Web Advisor is to evaluate and maintain the 
"links" gateway to resources outside the Faculty.</p>

<p>One vital tool is the CD server.  This is the central hub of 
information storage, and brings a range of CD resources to computers of 
all types through the network in a manner that is extremely fast and 
transparent to the user.  This allows instantaneous access to important 
language and bibliographic resources without relying on web links 
outside the Faculty.  The CD server is the central point of information 
storage for Latin and Greek text searching, for platform-independent
Perseus, and for the database of Classical Bibliography.  The server is 
a Windows NT Terminal Edition with Citrix mainframe.  The strength of 
this is to deliver PC applications to all platforms, Mac, PC and Unix, 
meaning that PC format CDs are available to the Mac library machines.  
The entire network is backed up on tape every evening.</p>

<p>The cross-platform capability is essential to the Faculty's desire 
to bring this information to all types of machines, located in some 100 
colleges and university departments.  The Faculty is now working on 
Unicode Fonts for all college access requirements.  The problem of 
Greek fonts is now solvable by individual students through download 
from the net, but the Faculty's long-range solution for the University 
will be the Unicode fonts. </p>

<p>One benefit to having the information CD resident is speed.  When 
using Perseus, for example, cross-referencing and dictionary look-ups 
are seemingly instantaneous.  For information not in the central server, 
the student has access to the library CD collection, which runs from the 
Biblioteca Iuris Antiqua to Barrrington's Atlas, the OCD and the Leuven 
Database of Ancient Books, to dozens of others.</p>

<p>To facilitate the production of written work, each graduate student, 
and each member of staff, has password-protected mainframe space for 
storage of personal research.  It is a great advantage to be able to 
use any computer in the building to access your research work or 
dissertation.  This initiative is one of the most important direct 
benefits to the graduate student provided by the server system, and one 
of the most gratefully received.  The student can now view the world's
classical resources as a footnote to his dissertation, and his file as 
one of many on this giant database.</p>

<p>The efforts described here are internal to the Faculty of Classics 
and its building.  The central Computer Services department of the 
University brings a further depth of services, including classes in a 
variety of subjects related to information technologies, free to all 
associated with the University.  Some 100 libraries in Cambridge, 
including the main University Library with millions of volumes, can be 
accessed from any computer via telnet or web connection, and from 
outside the university via the web.  Email and web services are 
available throughout the university.  It is through these central 
services that the Faculty's initiatives are brought into the college 
room.  The Faculty is fortunate to be able to fund its own efforts in 
addition to the networking resources made available by the University.</p>

<p>Now I turn from this infrastructure to certain specific pedagogical 
initiatives being taken by the Faculty.  I begin with language 
resources. Some 25  hard copies each of the full Liddell and Scott Greek 
Lexicon  and the Lewis and Short Latin Lexicon are on the tables in the 
Classics Faculty Library.  Greek TLG and Latin Teubner searches of text 
databases are also available at any Faculty computer from the CD server. 
But for the undergraduate something more is needed, something that 
facilitates the reading of the set texts quickly but without too much 
hand-holding.  </p>

<p>The requirement here is not for an in-depth look at etymological 
data, but for a faster ability to find the core meaning of a particular 
word and its basic forms.  This tool should be accessible anywhere 
inside the University, should not require extensive installation on any 
particular machine, should be specific to the particular set texts 
required of undergraduates but not so customized that adding new texts 
is a major project.  It should be fast, easy, no-frills, and easily
expandable.</p>

<p>In co-operation with a private entrepreneur the Faculty has 
developed a package that combines the text of Cicero's orations 
<em>In Catilinam</em> 1 and 2 with a text analyzer and an Oxford Pocket 
Latin Dictionary.   From any machine within the Faculty domain name a 
student can punch up an icon and download a 172 K file that includes 
the dictionary, analyzer (written in Java) and the text. The 172 K 
zipped file size means that the download is fast, and given that it is 
downloaded the operation is immediate.</p>

<p>The student can work through the text, highlighting problem words.  
The analyzer brings up the word forms related to these problems.  
Because this is meant to be a fast and flexible tool for learning, 
there is no attempt, and no desire to attempt, to make the analyzer 
specific to each word. If one punches up the Latin <em>duces</em> one 
sees every <em>duc</em>- form with the parts of speech and basic
meanings attached.  </p>

<p>This means that the analyzer is not customized for each text, and 
can be easily linked to further texts.  Because there are some words 
not in the Oxford Pocket Dictionary the analyzer's dictionary has been 
enhanced as required by the text, resulting in an improved digital 
dictionary. Pedagogically, however, the student is forced to know the 
word forms and tables associated with the parts of speech in order to 
interpret what the analyzer brings up.  This is a tool, not a means to
bypassing the essential process of learning the language.  Plans now 
are to progress to the 12 set texts required of all undergraduates.</p>

<p>I turn now from the analyzer to certain other research resources 
that are unique to the Faculty of Classics.   The first of these is the 
catalog of casts in the Museum of Greek and Roman Art and Archaeology.  
The Museum, in the Classics Building, is dedicated naturally lit 
gallery with 636 full-size casts of Greek and Roman Art.  The museum 
guide is available on the web, and plans are underway to bring graphic 
photos of every cast onto the web.</p>

<p>The museum is also expanding the information available by cataloging 
on-line its shard collection. This is a collection of pottery and 
pottery fragments, many inscribed or decorated, that may be accessed by 
specialists through the web.  The intent is to make these pieces 
available to scholars world-wide, searchable by text, location, 
description and other criteria.</p>

<p>A further unique resource is the Faculty's collection of some 4000 
soft-paper etchings of Greek and Roman inscriptions.  These were 
collected over the past century by various scholars, often for their 
own use and then donated to the university.  It is intended that this 
so-called "squeeze" collection be made available on the web, linked to 
a Filemaker database.  This initiative should be considered a step 
towards a general, comprehensive database of Greek and Roman 
inscriptions visually accessible by researchers and searchable by 
types, locations and key-words.</p>

<p>In the end we come full circle, and must re-ask the central question.  
What have we really accomplished for the student, and for the 
researcher?  This, I submit, is one question, not two.  At this 
conference a controversy has developed, centered on whether academic 
specialists should be spending their time developing web pages and 
similar electronic resources.  Wouldn't researchers' time be better 
spent doing pure research, leaving the organization of a web page to
a computer specialist?  Should the university administration even allow 
the professor to do so, or should the institution insist on a more 
profitable use of the researcher's time?</p>

<p>I think this suggestion is misguided.  The premise at work is that 
research and pedagogy are distinct activities, with no connection to 
one another, and that the act of preparing a presentation of material 
is somehow of a different, presumably lower, order than "pure" research.  
This is misguided because it fails to recognize that research, and the 
thinking required to produce meaningful results from the research, 
<em>is</em> as much a process of organizing material as is a 
pedagogical presentation.</p>

<p>Research is not just collecting disparate facts and putting them 
into lists.  Nor is it an act of creating an arbitrary organization 
that has no relationship to reality.  The pragmatist concept of truth 
notwithstanding, the researcher's mind is not a flux of 
undifferentiated chaos.  Research rather includes the discovery of 
relationships between the facts, including causal connections and the 
hierarchical orderings.  Research and pedagogy are both processes of 
organizing material according to these relationships.  In this sense 
the researcher is as much a student as a person who sits in a 
classroom, and the process of research is self-teaching just as 
pedagogy is teaching someone else.</p>

<p>The activity involved in organizing an academic paper is a process 
of translating the multi-dimensional relationships between facts into a 
linear argument.  The interleaving of web pages is a similar process, 
albeit one that frees the writer from the constraints of strict linear 
presentation and allows multiple options in the direction that the 
reader can take.  The reader may alter his own sequence of grasping the 
material as his own context of knowledge requires.  This grants to the
writer new ways of organizing material, which requires thinking.  
Although it may seem inefficient for a professor to do a web site 
himself, and even though greater technical support would often be
beneficial, the professor has not lost anything by going through the 
process of creating this organization.  He now better understands the 
new tool which is the web, and better understands the thinking behind a 
well-organized electronic presentation.  If academics are to be able to 
guide the programmers toward the development of tools that can truly 
assist specialized fields of study, academics will have to understand 
programmers.</p>

<p>I think the greatest benefits of information technologies to the 
student are yet unfulfilled, since the initiatives remain ongoing.  Of 
course the increased accessibility of information is a means of
empowering the self-motivated student to step beyond the boundaries of 
the degree requirements and to become a person who truly researches 
issues in classical antiquity.  I think that the text analyzer at 
Cambridge will allow more comprehension over a given amount of time for 
the student reader.  I remain unconvinced that there can ever be a 
shortcut to the basic process of observing a piece of historical 
evidence, or a line of ancient text, and understanding the meaning of 
that evidence.   But if the initiatives taken here reduce the time 
spent on matters not directly related to this primary task, then they 
are a success.  Despite the birthing pains associated with all new
methods, this is certainly the case.</p>
