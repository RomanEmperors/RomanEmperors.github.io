<b>Manuel II PALAIOLOGOS (1391-1425 A.D.)</b></h3></center>

<center><b>Wilhelm Baum</b>
<br>Univeristät Graz, Austria</center>

<p>Manuel II(1391-1425) was the second-to-last emperor of the East-Roman
(Byzantine) Empire.<b><a href="#Note_1">[[1]]</a></b> His second son and
successor <b><a href="drag.html">Constantine XI</a></b> died
in 1453 during the conquest of the imperial capital by the Ottoman Sultan
Mehmed II. The emperor was from the house of the Palaiologoi, whose founder
<b><a href="mike8.html">Michael VIII</a></b> in 1261 had driven
the Crusaders from the imperial capital, which they had conquered in 1204.
In the course of the fourteenth century the Ottoman Turkish empire had
become the major rival of the empire, which, now shrunken to a minor state,
had been almost completely expelled from Asia Minor. <b><a href="johnV.html">Emperor
John V</a></b> (1341-1391) had to deal not only with the plague but also
with the crossing of the Hellespont by the Turks, who first conquered Thrace
and Macedonia and, in 1389, in the battle of Kossovo destroyed and conquered
the Serbian Empire. In 1365/6 he undertook a voyage to Hungary to seek
support there; his son Manuel accompanied him on it. In 1370/71 the emperor
undertook a new voyage to Europe, to seek support there; Manuel freed him
in 1371 under humiliating circumstances from debtor's prison in Venice.
The rapid decline of the empire showed itself also in the deterioration
of art and coinage; Byzantine gold solidi for centuries had been the leading
currency of the eastern Mediterranean. Now the gold currency of the Venetians
took its place -- that is, the currency of the state in the Christian world
which had most profited from the decline of Byzantium through the attack
on Constantinople in 1203/04, which the Greeks even today have not forgotten,
and had annexed portions of the Peloponnesus as well as Crete. Emperor
Manuel II had as a rule only silver and bronze coins struck; only a few
gold nomismata are preserved.<b><a href="#Note_2">[[2]]</a></b> The papacy
and the catholic powers tried repeatedly to force Byzantium into subjection
to Roman sovereignty, but these compulsory "unions" lasted only briefly,
since the people did not join in carrying them out and they resulted in
no effective help.
</p><p><b><a href="johnV.html">John V</a></b>, Manuel's father, was
a weak and unsuccessful ruler. He was twice deposed, the first time by
his son <b><a href="andy4.html">Andronicus IV</a></b> and then
by his grandson <b><a href="johnVII.html">John VII</a></b>. The
decline of the empire was hastened by the civil wars; in 1346 the influential
John Cantacuzenus had himself crowned emperor <b><a href="john6.html">John
VI</a></b>, but had to abdicate in 1354. He lived almost thirty more years
yet as a monk, and composed a series of historically interesting works.
Helena Cantacuzena, the daughter of this short-reigned emperor, became
the spouse of <b><a href="johnV.html">John V</a></b> and mother
of Manuel II, who was born in 1350 and in 1373 was raised by his father
to the rank of co-emperor.<b><a href="#Note_3">[[3]]</a></b> Manuel's teacher
was the learned Demetrius Cydones, to whom he addressed twenty preserved
letters. In 1359 Constantinople was besieged by the Turks for the first
time. In collaboration with Sultan Murad II (1362-89) John's son <b><a href="andy4.html">Andronicus
IV</a></b> staged a coup in 1376 against his father and brother, who were
incarcerated in the prison of the Anemas tower of the Blachernai palace,
where <b><a href="andy4.html">Andronicus</a></b> himself had
previously been imprisoned. In 1379 father and son succeeded in fleeing
to Murad, whom they promised higher tribute than hitherto and military
help, if they were restored. <b><a href="#Note _4">[[4]]</a></b> Thus Byzantium
had become a client state of the Turks, and was obligated to paying tribute
and to military alliance. The decline manifested itself also in the fact
that after the Turks' great military successes Manuel found himself compelled
to confiscate half of the property of the monasteries for the benefit of
the soldiers. He hoped to be able to reverse this if times improved. But
subsequently he imposed high taxes on the lands remaining to the monks.<b><a href="#Note_5">[[5]]</a></b>
</p><p>After the establishment of the Turks in Macedonia and the decline of
the Serbian Empire, the Byzantine Empire appeared definitely headed for
destruction. The population of the imperial capital had shrunk to between
forty and fifty thousand. The only gain in power which <b><a href="johnV.html">John
V</a></b> achieved was to regain the Despotate of the Morea in the Peloponnesus,
which had been administered for decades by the Cantacuzeni. He appointed
his third son Theodore to govern it. From 1383 to 1387, Manuel operated
as independent emperor in Thessaloniki, the second city of the empire in
size, but already encircled by the Turks; it had been besieged by the Turks
since 1383.<b><a href="#Note_6">[[6]]</a></b> On the occasion of the Turks'
ultimatum at the start of the siege, the crown prince, as viceroy, directed
a speech to the city's inhabitants, summoning them to resist<b><a href="#Note_7">.[[7]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Manuel left Thessaloniki shortly before it was conquered in April 1387,
and fled to Lesbos. From 1387 to 1389 he was in Lemnos, one of the few
Aegean islands to remain in the emperor's hands.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1386 even
Mount Athos came under the rule of the Turks. For Sultan Bayazid I (1389-1402)
the conquest of Constantinople was the logical conclusion of a process
which his father had initiated. He skilfully played the pretenders to the
Byzantine throne off against each other, and backed <b><a href="johnVII.html">John
VII's</a></b> (<b><a href="andy4.html">Andronicus IV</a></b>'
s son) seizure of power in April 1390<b><a href="#Note_8">.[[8]]</a></b>
Thereupon Manuel returned from Lemnos to Constantinople, forced his way
into the city on September 17, 1390, expelled his nephew <b><a href="johnVII.html">John
VII</a></b>, and reestablished his father as emperor. While his father
was able to rule for a last time, Manuel had to reside at the sultan's
court and as an obedient vassal accept any humiliation.<b><a href="#Note_9">[[9]]</a></b>
There he met again with his nephew <b><a href="johnVII.html">John
VII, </a></b>who had fled to the same place, and now both of them had to
support the Turks, who raised the tribute. When <b><a href="johnV.html">John
V</a></b> wanted to strengthen the walls, the sultan threatened to blind
Manuel, and forced him to put an end to the fortification works. When <b><a href="johnV.html">John
V</a></b> died in February 1391, after a reign of a half century, the possessions
of the Byzantine Empire consisted only of the capital, some cities on the
Sea of Marmora, some Aegean islands, and the Morea, which made up less
than half of the Peloponnesus. "Byzantium survived only thanks to its walls
and because the sultan at the moment had other aims of conquest before
his eyes."<b><a href="#Note_10">[[10]]</a></b>
</p><p>After his father's death, Manuel fled from the sultan's camp and hastened
to Constantinople, in order to forestall his nephew's plans. After his
return, he married (on the tenth of February, 1392)&nbsp;<a name="Note_H"></a>Helena
Dragasch, the daughter of the Serbian prince Constantine of Serres. In
the national museum in Sofia there is preserved an icon which empress Helena
had brought along for her father who fell in battle against the Turks in
1395.<b><a href="#Note_11">[[11]]</a></b> Both of them were crowned by
the patriarch Antonius IV. The emperor wished in this way to give expression
to the fact that he was still the highest ranking of all Christian rulers.
The emperor, however, was again humiliated by the sultan in the same year,
in that he had to command a Turkish fleet. The archimandrite Ignatius of
Smolensk has left us a description of the coronation. The pompous ceremony
was supposed to strengthen the people's morale and demonstrate self-confidence.
The patriarch prevailed upon the Metropolitan of Russia, Cyprian, that
in the liturgy the Byzantine emperor should be mentioned first. This incurred
the wrath of the Grand Prince of Moscow, Vasili I. the Grand Prince coined
the sentence: "Church have we one, but emperor have we none." Byzantium
however held on to the dogma to the bitter end that its ruler was the only
legitimate emperor and hence was the head of the civilized world. Nonetheless
Antonius stressed in 1393 in his well-known missive to the Grand Prince
that precisely because of the Turks' stranglehold the exceptional position
of the emperor in the Christian world had to be emphasized. "The emperor
occupies in the church that place which no other secular ruler can occupy.
Many other emperors in the course of history have advanced religion, summoned
ecumenical councils, confirmed the canons, fought against heresies, set
up primacies (i.e., rankings of patriarchal seats) as well as provinces
and dioceses. All this justifies their value and their place in the church....
patriarchs, metropolitans, and bishops therefore everywhere respect the
name of the emperor... For Christians there is no church without emperor.Emperor
and Church are closely connected. The Christians battle against the heretics
and the most orthodox emperor is at the same time defender of the church."
<b><a href="#Note_12">[[12]]</a></b>The
emperor and the patriarch each sent an "apokrisarios" (envoy) to Russia,
who should both represent the same position, so that it might be clear
to the Grand Prince that emperor and church constituted a unity.<b><a href="#Note_13">[[13]]</a></b>
</p><p>Bayazit was beside himself with rage when faced with the new emperor's
successes. He pointed out to him that he had no power outside the "city"
and began systematically to tie the empire off from the Balkans. Manuel
had to consent to a treaty in which it was specified that a quarter for
Turkish merchants should be set up with its own Kadi (a Moslem learned
man and magistrate)<b><a href="#Note_14">.[[14]]</a></b>&nbsp; At first
Manuel succeeded in taking advantage of the sultan's involvements to reestablish
control over Thessaloniki and parts of Macedonia.<b><a href="#Note_15">[[15]]</a></b>
The sultan knew that help could come only from Hungary and in 1393 conquered
Thessaly and Bulgaria and began the siege of Constantinople, the longest
in the city's history, which was to last from 1394 to 1402. In the city
hunger and despair prevailed. In 1395 the sultan built the fortress of
Anadolu Hisar on the Turkish side of the Bosporus. Bulgaria became the
first Ottoman Turkish province in Europe. The sultan wished to show who
was boss, and in the winter of 1393/94 summoned Manuel, his nephew <b><a href="johnVii.html">John
VII</a></b>, and Theodore, Despot of the Morea, as well as Prince Stefan
Lazarevic of Serbia to Serres, where he at first wanted to kill them all.
Some Byzantine officers were blinded. Finally they were able to return
home; only Theodore was to take part in the conquest of Europe. He succeeded
in escaping, however, and hastened to Mistras, in order to organize the
defense of the Morea. The events in Serres confirmed Manuel's opinion that
the Turks were not amenable to any kind of reasoning. Later demands by
the
sultan to appear before him were declined by the emperor.
</p><p>Now Manuel sought military aid against the Turks, first from Pope Boniface
IX and King Sigismund of Hungary. <b><a href="#Note_16">[[16]]</a></b>
Sphrantzes, the historian in the emperor's service, repors that the initiative
originated with King Sigismund: Dukas on the other hand mentions that the
emperor wrote to the Pope and the kings of Hungary and France in this matter.<b><a href="#Note_17">[[17]</a></b>]
Relief from the West was the only hope for Byzantium. At the end of 1395
Manuel sent his envoy Manuel Philanthropenus to King Sigismund; at the
beginning of 1396 he concluded a treaty with him in which he obligated
himself to equip ten ships at his own expense and three at the king's expense
for the crusade.<b><a href="#Note _18">[[18]]</a></b> The crusade of the
Hungarian king Sigismund of Luxemburg ended on September 25, 1396 in the
battle of Nicopolis in a complete fiasco.<b><a href="#Note_19">[[19]</a></b>]
According to the panegyric of Isidore of Monemvasia the Hungarian king
fled on imperial galleys across the Black Sea to Constantinople, where
he met with Manuel and then returned to Hungary. Manuel sent a manuscript
message to the Venetian council, putting Byzantium in the hands of the
Signorie. But Venice, which already in the fourteenth century viewed Byzantium
as a "lost outpost," abandoned Byzantium to its fate. It was ready "to
use Byzantium as a pawn, to surrender it as a concession to the Turks,"
if it could thereby be assured of controlling the southern Aegean.<b><a href="#Note_20">[[20]]</a></b>
This first test of strength between the Ottomans and western Europe hardly
brought Byzantium any respite. In vain Manuel sent appeals for help to
the Pope, the Doge of Venice, and the kings of France, England, and Aragon,
as well as the Grand Prince of Moscow.<b><a href="#Note_21">[[21]]</a></b>
A rumor circulated that <b><a href="johnVII.html">John VII</a></b>
had made an offer to the French king to sell him his claim to the Byzantine
throne. The siege of Constantinople dragged on. In return for the construction
of a mosque and the appointment of a Kadi it was lifted.<b><a href="#Note_22">[[22]]</a></b>
Before the end of 1399 Manuel turned even to the Mongolian ruler Tamerlane
for help against the Ottomans.<b><a href="#Note_23">[[23]]</a></b> The
French marshal Boucicaut, who had taken part in the battle of Nicopolis,
in 1399 broke through the Turkish blockade of the Dardenelles with 1200
soldiers and arrived in Constantinople to the rejoicing of the populace.
He persuaded the emperor to accompany him on his return trip to Europe.
</p><p>The emperor's trip to Europe, to the centers of political power, caused
considerable excitement. The weak Holy Roman king Wenceslas was not among
the personalities whom the emperor wanted to visit. On December 10, 1399
the emperor embarked on a voyage to Venice, Padua, Vicenza, Pavia, Paris
and London to get help.<b><a href="johnVII.html"> John VII</a></b>,
regent of Selymbria, had lost the sultan's favor, because he had not betrayed
the capital into Turkish hands. Presumably Boucicaut arranged his reconciliation
with Manuel. At all events the emperor did not quite trust his nephew,
since he left his family behind with his brother in Mistras. Patriarch
Matthew I supported <b><a href="johnVII.html">John VII</a></b>
as regent of the empire, primarily during the siege of Constantinople in
1401. The emperor's first stop was in Italy. Pope Boniface XII on May 27,
1400 ordered the payment of a "crusade-tithe" for emperor Manuel against
the "perfidious Bayazit." For him this was a means of strengthening his
prestige vis-a-vis the pope of Avignon.<b><a href="#Note_24">[[24]]</a></b>
Giangaleazzo Visconti took advantage of the opportunity to bring as a teacher
to Pavia and Milan, in 1400, the Byzantine scholar Manuel Chrysoloras,
who had been on diplomatic missions in Venice in 1394/95 and 1396, and
had begun his activity as a humanistic teacher in Florence in 1397. Charles
VI of France received the emperor with great pomp in Paris in June 1400
and similarly Henry IV in December 1400 in London. The western Roman king,
Wenceslas, son of Charles IV, was as little engaged against the Turks as
his father had been. The emperor employed Constantinopolitan relics and
holy objects to win over the princes of Europe. He included even Spain
in his plans of union.<b><a href="#Note_25">[[25]]&nbsp;</a></b> In the
Aragonese archives there are still some few letters preserved in which
military support is to be purchased with relics. In Milan he made the acquaintance
of Peter Philagris, a Greek, who later became pope as Alexander V. Manuel's
travels brought him just as little success as the previous ones which his
father had undertaken. The highly educated emperor gained much sympathy
in Europe. Unlike his father he offered neither a personal "conversion"
nor a union with the Papacy. John VII kept his position at home. In 1400
he received the news that the Mongols had invaded Asia Minor. For Byzantium
they were welcome allies against the Turks. During his absence Manuel II
had appointed his nephew <b><a href="johnVII.html">John VII</a></b>
co-regent. While the emperor was still in Paris, news arrived of Bayazit's
overwhelming defeat in the battle of Ankara (1402), which afforded Byzantium
a chance to catch its breath. Tamerlane (died 1405), the ruler of Samarkand,
had defeated the rising Ottoman Empire and held it in check until his death.
The emperor did not return home from Europe until 1403, and had failed
to secure either financial or political help.
</p><p>The first result of the battle of Ankara was that the siege of Constantinople
was lifted. Demetrius Chrysoloras, John Kananos, and Joseph Bryennios saw
in the good outcome of the siege new proofs of the protection of the city
by the mother of God. On this occasion Manuel composed a dramatic piece,
an imaginative construct of what Timur (=Tamerlane) might say to a person
in so humiliating a situation as the sultan now found himself in. This
sultan, who so long as things went well for him, made great proud speeches
and was intolerable with his threats, actually now was trundled around
in a cage.<b><a href="#Note_26">[[26]]</a></b> The emperor remained entirely
within the limits of rhetorical routine with this piece of literature which
was popular in Byzantium. His viceroy sent presents to the victorious Timur,
who reacted with the demand that the tribute which had hitherto been paid
to the Ottomans be paid henceforth to him.<b><a href="#Note_27">[[27]]</a></b>
</p><p>The Anatolian possessions of the Turks were now under the control of
Tamerlane. Bayazit's eldest son, Suleiman, met with <b><a href="johnVII.html">John
VII</a></b> in August, 1402. In February 1403 he concluded a peace treaty
on the Gallipoli peninsula in which he gave back Thessaloniki, the Chalkidiki
with Athos, and the islands Skiathos, Skopelos, and Skyros as well as a
strip of the Black Sea coast. The European possessions of the Turks in
"Rumeli" with their capital at Adrianople were in turn recognized by Byzantium.
Byzantium no longer owed tribute to the Turks, and Suleiman swore to become
a vassal of the emperor.<b><a href="#Note_28">[[28]</a></b>] Here it was
decided who the Turkish barons were, who should surrender Thessaloniki
to the Byzantines. This was the Byzantine empire's last political success.
Manuel found out about it only in the following month in Venice. It appears
that during a stop-over in Gallipoli in June 1403 he confirmed <b><a href="johnVII.html">John
VII's</a></b> treaty with the Turks, but with one stipulation: <b><a href="johnVII.html">John
VII</a></b> had to transfer his base to Thessaloniki, where he remained
until his death in 1407. <b><a href="#Note_29">[[29]]</a></b>
</p><p>The treaty of Gallipoli was, as we have said, the last significant political
success of the Byzantine empire. Paying tribute was a thing of the past:
between 1379 and 1402 Byzantium had paid 690,000 hyperpyra (or 345,000
ducats) to the Ottomans. The treaty of Gallipoli provided Byzantium an
additional short chance to catch its breath. At first Manuel held on to
the idea of winning over the Christian states of Europe to a crusade, but
nevertheless accepted the treaty. In accordance with Byzantine custom Suleiman
is specifically addressed as "son" in a letter from Manuel in 1404.<b><a href="#Note_30">[[30]]</a></b>
He refrained from any aggressive moves against Byzantium. Among the Ottomans,
the disagreements among Bayazit' s sons continued. When Musa put pressure
on Byzantium, Manuel II called upon Mehmet for help. He used the opportunity
to bring the Ottoman empire together under single control. Musa is said
even to have offered the emperor the Turkish provinces in Europe. The final
winner was Mehmet I (reigned 1413-21), with Manuel's support, who maintained
peace with Byzantium, even after the collapse of Tamerlane's empire. In
1412/13 Manuel supported him in the war against his brother Musa. In 1413
Mehmet confirmed the peace treaty of Gallipoli with Byzantium, which regained
further territories on the Black Sea<b><a href="#Note_31">.[[31]</a></b>]
In 1408 Manuel's son Andronicus became Despot of Thessaloniki. With an
eye to restoring the city walls the emperor, the patriarch, and finally
Joseph Bryennius delivered speeches in which it was emphasized that God
would not desert the city, unless the Byzantines themselves just sat there
with their hands folded.
</p><p>The relaxation of the situation could be seen in the fact that Manuel
for the first time could leave the capital and travel to Thessaloniki (in
1407) and to the Peloponnesus (1414/16), where he supported his nephew
Theodore II as Despot of the Morea. When en route through Macedonia he
found among the suffragan bishops of Thessaloniki an ideal candidate for
bishop of Walachia - the area was already under Turkish influence <b>-</b>,
he sent him to Constantinople and instructed the patriarch to ordain him.
This led to conflict between emperor and patriarch, who wanted to gain
for the church more independence from the state in view of the political
situation. When the patriarch Matthew died the emperor wanted to assure
himself of the church's obedience; so he called a synod, at which the rights
of the emperor in the church, and the new patriarch, Joseph I were both
confirmed. The Byzantine panegyrist John the Replete (Chortasmenos) composed
an encomium on the emperor when he returned. The situation of the surrounded
empire was for the moment consolidated -- without any help from the West.
In 142l Manuel crowned his son <b><a href="johnVIII.html">John</a></b>
as co-emperor.
</p><p>Manuel knew that Byzantium was lost without the West. Therefore he sought
political support in Europe. The "Autokrator" of Byzantium could not get
very far with the conciliar movement, which wanted to limit the Pope's
position in the West. For the Byzantines a general council on the model
proposed by the "conciliarists" of the early fifteenth century was not
the correct means for reform and for reunification in the faith. On Christmas
1409 Manuel congratulated Alexander V (chosen pope by the council of Pisa)
on his election and reminded him how they had met in 1400 in Milan. He
expressed hope for a union of churches and sent the diplomat John Chrysoloras
to him.<b><a href="#Note_32">[[32]]</a></b> (He had already sent his uncle
Manuel<b><a href="#Note_33">[[33]]</a></b> to France to collect money appropriated
for the crusade.<b><a href="#Note_34">[[34]]</a></b>&nbsp; At the beginning
of the year 1410 Manuel proposed to the Venetians that they join together
in separating the Turks in Europe from those in Asia. The most serene republic,
however, rejected the idea, since the sultan's power was already too great.
<b><a href="#Note_35">[[35]]</a></b>
</p><p>The emperor of the West had very little contact with the emperor of
the East in the late middle ages. Manuel remained in touch by letter with
Sigismund of Luxemburg (reigned 1410-37) who had in the meantime been elected
to the Holy Roman throne. In 1411 an embassy led by Manuel Chrysoloras
met with Sigismund to discuss a projected union with him. Now Sigismund
proclaimed a crusade to the emperor.<b><a href="#Note_36">[[36]]</a></b>
The Holy Roman and Byzantine empires, he said, were a single state; after
the fashion of the ancient emperors one could seek helpers in both parts
of it and share responsibilities. He wanted to break through from Hungary
to the Peloponnesus -- a utopian plan, which Sigismund never could have
brought to pass. He also requested his imperial brother to propose a time
and place for a council.<b><a href="#Note_37">[[37]]</a></b> The emperor,
who preferred to concentrate on foreign relations, seems primarily also
to have underestimated the economic position of the Turks. Economic problems
were of little interest to the theologically educated emperor.
</p><p>In 1412, in his second letter, Sigismund informed the emperor of the
resumption of the war with Venice and reminded him of how much sorrow the
republic of St. Mark had inflicted on Byzantium since 1204. Byzantium should
let trade with Venice become paralyzed -- an illusory plan in view of the
military situation of the empire. But there was no longer any talk of a
Crusade.<b><a href="#Note_38">[[38]]</a></b> In June 1414 there were negotiations
at Trino between Sigismund and the pope, in which the participation of
Byzatium in the council was considered. For that reason Manuel had sent
John Chrysoloras to Sigismund as envoy.<b><a href="#Note_39">[[39]] </a></b>In
the summer of 1414 the king answered Manuel's epistle in a third preserved
letter, and made known his intention of helping Byzantium after the end
of the Council of Konstanz. He reported about the summoning of the council,
to which the emperor should send Manuel Chrysaloras. <b><a href="#Note_40">[[40]]</a></b>
The former Byzantine possessions, whose recovery by the Crusaders might
be expected, should revert to Byzantium.<b> </b>His offer that he was ready
to step aside and hand sovereignty over to Manuel, if that brought about
a reunification of the churches, admittedly must not have been meant seriously.
Likewise in this letter there was no talk of a crusade. Sigismund named
Manuel Chrysaloras and his nephew John counts palatine and received them
among his courtiers. In 1416 Manuel mediated between Sigismund and the
Republic of Venice, but without result. At the beginning of the year 1420
Manuel tried once more futilely, through his envoy John Eudaimonoioannes,
to negotiate peace between Sigismund and Venice.<b><a href="#Note_41">[[41]]</a></b>
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>At the Council of Konstanz, which took place with Sigismund's authoritative
participation and was supposed to end the strife among the three popes,
the Byzantine ambassadors Nicholas Eudaimonoioannes, his son Andronicus,
and Joseph Bladynteros, who had arrived in Konstanz on March 3, 1415, presented
a plan for union and sought support against the Turks.<b><a href="#Note_42">[[42]]</a></b>
They called for an ecumenical council in Constantinople at the Pope's expense.
Manuel Chrysoloras had come to Konstanz with the envoys, perhaps without
official mandate.<b><a href="#Note_43"> [[43]] </a></b>He died, however,
in mid-April 1415 in Konstanz. The envoys exceeded their<b> </b>mandate,
however, with the result that the agreement which they brought with them
to Constantinople found no acceptance there. In February 1416 the "bringing
back of the Greeks" was dropped from the agenda of the council. Manuel
was more interested in political progress."The emperor viewed the union,
or better the threat of a union, as a way of putting political pressure
on the Turks, but did not promise himself success from any council, since
he realized that at such a synod, the fighting would be with open vizors,
and two very different church systems would collide<b> </b>: the old "Constantinian"
and the western papal; a failed union council however would have the fatal
consequence of depriving the emperor of one of the effective threats against
the Ottomans."<b><a href="#Note_44">[[44]] </a></b>He was no longer concerned
with the union of churches.<b><a href="#Note_46">[[45]]</a></b> In March
1416 Manuel sent a new embassy to Konstanz, to advise on the subjects of
church union and measures of aid, but as a result of Sigismund's absence
the negotiations were postponed until after his return from Spain.<b><a href="#Note_46">[[46]]</a></b>
The envoys finally presented the -- unfortunately now lost -- thirty-six
articles of the emperor and the patriarch. However they rejected negotiations
so long as the Latin church was without a pope. A pope was always an easier
partner for the emperor than a "democratic" council. After the election
of Pope Martin V new negotiations were started between the Roman king Sigismund
and pope which had as a result the initiation of dynastic connections between
the emperor's sons and Italian princely houses. Before February 1419 Manuel
sent his envoy John Bladynteros to Pope Martin V, whom he informed that
the council would have to meet in Constantinople.<b><a href="#Note_47">[[47]]</a></b>
The Council of Konstanz shows that the conciliar idea found little response
in the eastern church.
</p><p>The treaty of November 1419 between Venice and the Turks, freed the
Turks' hands to proceed against Byzantium and Hungary. They now besieged
the Hungarian Black-Sea harbor Kilia. When Mehmet I in 1421 requested permission
to travel from Europe to Asia via Constantinople, Manuel rejected the plan
of murdering him and personally accompanied him. Up to his death in 142l
he kept the peace with Byzantium. The war party in Byzantium, to which
<b><a href="johnVIII.html">John
VIII</a></b> belonged, rebuked Manuel for not having murdered Mehmet at
a favorable opportunity, and injected itself into the quarrel for the succession
among the Turks. In the summer of 1421 there was a new treaty between the
pretender Mustafa and Byzantium, which received some territories in the
Chalkidike and on the Black Sea and promised military aid to the sultan.<b><a href="#Note_48">[[48]]</a></b>
Murat II, one of Bayazit's sons, wanted to renew the peace treaty with
Byzantium and even hand over Kallipolis (Gallipoli), according to the historian
Chalkokondyles.
</p><p>But things turned out otherwise; Byzantium again bet on the wrong pretender.
In Constantinople there was now generational conflict. Manuel wanted to
maintain the peace; but his son <b><a href="johnVIII.html">John</a></b>
bet on the war party, supported Mutafa, and lost. "Do what you please.
For I, my son, am old and close to death. The empire, however, and all
that pertains to it, have I relinquished to you," Sphrantzes reports Manuel
as saying.<b><a href="#Note_49">[[49]]</a></b> Also Chalkokondyles mentions
the conflict, as<b><a href="johnVIII.html"> John </a></b>tossed
his father's warning to the winds. Mustafa crossed the Bosporus on Genoese
ships, but was beaten by his brother Murat at the beginning of the year
1422. Manuel withdrew from the plague into the cloister of Peribletos as
a monk.
</p><p>After the death of Mehmet I, his brother Murat II (reigned 1421-51)
resumed the aggressive policy of Bayazit. The collusion of<b><a href="johnVIII.html">
John </a></b>with the Turkish pretender Mustafa provided the sultan with
the pretext to impose a complete blockade on Constantinople. In 1421 Manuel
II, now aged seventy-one, gave over a great part of his power to his eldest
son. <b><a href="johnVIII.html">John VIII</a></b>, on the other
hand, though his marriage with Sophia of Montserrat and the espousal of
his brother Theodorus II to Cleopa Malatesta, tried in the same year to
win new allies in Italy. From June to September 1422 Constantinople was
besieged for the third time by the Turks. The fortifications of the city
nonetheless held up to the Turkish pressure. The historian John Kananos
reports how the elderly and seriously ill emperor, who could no longer
mount his horse, was represented by his son on campaign. At the end of
September the defeated Mustafa, whose guardian Manuel II had been, came
to Constantinople and confirmed the treaty of Gallipoli. On October 1,
1422, Manuel II suffered a stroke that resulted in paralysis. He handed
the government over to his son <b><a href="johnVIII.html">John
VIII</a></b>.<b><a href="#Note_50">[[50]]</a></b> Andronicus, Manuel's
youngest son went to Genoese-controlled Pera, and from there he betook
himself to the Ottoman encampment, as pretender to the throne, on the model
of <b><a href="johnVII.html">John VII.</a><a href="#Note_51">[[51]]</a></b>
Another son, Demetrius, left the capital and went to Hungary. In 1423 Thesaloniki
was lost once more, irretrievably; the despot Andronicus sold it to the
Venetians.<b><a href="#Note_52">[[52]] </a></b>In 1430 the Turks conquered
the important harbor city for good. In 1424 Murat concluded a new treaty
with Byzantium, which again became tribute-paying. In 1423 <b><a href="johnVIII.html">John</a></b>
traveled by way of Venice and Milan to Ofen (Budapest), in order to negotiate
with Sigismund of Luxemburg about support for Byzantium.<b><a href="#Note_53">[[53]]
</a></b>This
put Sigismund into an awkward situation, as he was at the same time negotiating
an armistice in regard to his quarrel with the Hussites. So no help could
be expected from him, either. In 1419 the theologian Joseph Bryennius delivered
several addresses in the emperor's presence, establishing him as carrier-out
of the Testaments, and later turning against the papacy's efforts at union.
</p><p>The old emperor admonished his son not to give up any fundamental Byzantine
positions in negotiating union with the papacy. He dissuaded him from stirring
the western powers up for a new crusade, as this would lead to a new confrontation
with the Turks. When Pope Martin V sent the Franciscan Antonio di Masa
to Constantinople, the emperor was already seriously ill and his son busy
with defensive measures The patriarch answered the pope's questions and
articulated the old Byzantine concepts and reservations vis a vis the papacy.
The emperor informed the pope in November 1422 that the council absolutely
had to take place in Constantinople<b><a href="#Note_54">[[54]]</a></b>.
The important matter was speedy help against the Turks; then one could
worry about union.<b><a href="#Note_55">[[55]]</a></b> On his deathbed
Manuel recommended to his son, admittedly to keep the Latins hoping for
the prospect of union, so as to obtain military help, but at the same time
to demand a council, so as to drag things out and not to run the risk of
a church union without popular support. It was clear to him that two quite
different chuch systems stood facing each other. Only in the west was there
a lively debate between conciliarism and the pope's primacy; for the orthodox
church this was a closed question. Likewise the historian George Sphrantzes
emphasizes this skepticism on the part of the emperor, who was concerned
only with a purely political solution to the conflict and wanted to set
aside pope and council.<b><a href="#Note_56">[[56]]</a></b> The aged emperor
was worried about his son's ambition, and warned him against irritating
the sultan. According to Sphrantzes one day when<b><a href="johnVIII.html">
John</a></b> left his father's bedside with a grim expression, he is supposed
to have said that in another age his son would perhaps have been a great
ruler. But now that the empire needed a good administrator in view of the
external situation, <b><a href="johnVIII.html">John</a></b> would
possibly deliver the fatal blow to the empire. Sultan Murat feared nothing
so much as the hanky-panky about church union, in which he saw the prerequisite
for western military aid to Byzantium.<b><a href="#Note_57">[[57]]</a></b>
On July 21 1425, the old emperor died in Constantinople, after dictating
his will to Sphrantzes. He was buried in the monastic church of the Pantokrator.
Bessarion of Trapezus, later to be famous, pronounced the eulogy. Manuel's
grave was later destroyed by the Turks, just like all the other graves
of the house of the Palaiologoi.
</p><p>Manuel's writings have been preserved for posterity in spite of the
conquest and destruction of Constantinople. Of particular interest is his
attitude toward Islam. After his enthronement in March 1391 Manuel II still
had to perform military service for the sultan in Asia Minor from June
1391 to January 1392 as a vassal of the Turks<b><a href="#Note_58">.[[58]]</a></b>
As part of it he not only had to support the sultan against the Selcuks,
but as an especial humiliation he had to aid his mortal enemy with the
conquest of Philadelphia, the last Byzantine hold-out in in Asia Minor,
particularly since his father had had to tear down the new fortification
in Constantinople shortly before his death. The emperor, who on the coins
still bore the title King and Autokrator, was as a vassal of course subject
to the sultan's orders on campaign -- the sultan who amused himself at
banquets, while the emperor discussed Islam with the Kadi.<b> </b>From
October to December of 1391, the emperor enjoyed the hospitality of the
Mudarri (=Kadi) at Ankara and his two sons. A moslem born to Christian
parents acted as interpreter between the emperor and the Kadi. The result
of this was the "Twenty-six Dialogues with a Persian," which are dedicated
to his brother Theodore I. Presumably the emperor took notes at the time
of the conversations. <b><a href="#Note_59">[[59]]</a></b> Apart from the
emperor's writings there is no independent proof for the conversations'
ever taking place. They must represent a mixture of fact and fiction. At
the end the Kadi declared himelf ready to come to Constantinople and continue
the conversation with Manuel. With this work, which<b><i> </i></b>must
have come into being between the end of the campaign and the break with
Bayazit (1392-94) and which by 1399 had received its final editing, Manuel
made an important contribution to the knowledge of Islam on the part of
the Christians.<b><a href="#Note_60">[[60]]</a></b> The twenty-six dialogues
are preserved in four manuscripts, of which Ambros. L74 sup. (487) dates
to the fifteenth century.<b><a href="#Note_61">[[61]]</a></b>
</p><p>The theological quarrel of the Byzantines with Islam has a long tradition.
<b><a href="#Note_62">[[62]]</a></b>
John of Damascus, Theophanes the Confessor, Nicetas Choniates, Bartholomew
of Edessa and Demetrius Kydones made important contributions to it. <b><a href="#Note_63">[[63]]</a></b>
The emperor relied on the Apology of Christianity against Islam by his
maternal grandfather,
<b><a href="johnVI.html">John VI Cantacuzenus.</a><a href="#Note_64">[[64]]</a></b>
That in turn rested on the "Confutatio Alchorani" by the Dominican friar
Ricoldo of Montecroce (died 1320), which Demetrius Kydones had translated
into Greek.<b><a href="#Note_65">[[65]] </a></b>Grandfather and grandson
thus remained entirely within the framework of traditional Byzantine anti-Islamic
polemics. It is noteworthy that the emperor does not use the concept of
Sarakenoi (Saracens), customary in Byzantine terminology. <b><a href="#Note_66">[[66]]</a></b>
</p><p>Even the Turks were impressed by Manuel' s courage and demeanor. He
was also an extremely well educated man, who kept in touch with the important
intellectuals Demetrius Kydones and the last Byzantine philosopher Georgios
Gemistios Plethon.<b><a href="#Note_67">[[67]]</a></b>&nbsp; Like all important
Byzantine emperors, Manuel was also involved in the politics of the state
church. He concerned himself with the reform of the monasteries, and transferred
to the University of Constantinople any money which could be freed up.
About 1400 he gave the university its final shape. Higher education was
assigned to one of four chief directors. It was now referred to as "Katholikon
Mouseion." The emperor concentrated its buildings around the monastery
of St. John the Baptist in Petra, where there was a distinguished library,
which was made available to the students. The emperor transferred the patriarchal
academy to the Studios-Monastery in Constantinople (today Imrahor Camii),
where there was likewise a good library. Joseph Bryennios who was himself
a Studite monk, became its director. Bryennios, who taught exegesis at
the patriarchal academy, at the university covered the field of philosophy.
Numerous Italians visited the university, where Bessarion and George Scholarios
studied.<b><a href="#Note_68">[[68]]</a></b>
</p><p>The emperor's authoritarian line in the politics of the state church
is remarkable.<b><a href="#Note_69">[[69]</a></b>] Although both he and
Bryennios abjured Latin theology, they supported Latin studies. Whatever
happened, he did not want to give up his position of influence in the church.
As early as 1398 there were disputes at the synod concerning the emperor's
authoritarian procedures. In 1415 the metropolitan Matthew of Medela declared
that the emperor had been tyrannizing the church for the preceding twelve
years or so. The quarrel grew until in 1409 Matthew and other critics were
deposed and interned. The grand logothete Syropoulos reports concerning
the confirmation of his father's imperial prerogatives at the synod of
1416 for the church, "For me, who admire this remarkable emperor in all
things and consider myself incapable of praising him adequately, there
is this one thing, which I cannot agree with, because it is unworthy of
his virtue and his wisdom, as of a contrite heart -- that he has enslaved
God's church."<b><a href="#Note_70">[[70]]</a></b> Syropoulos also reports
that Manuel insisted on the right to convene a council. Patriarch Euthymios
gave thought to a reform of the relationships between state and church,
but his death gave the emperor a chance to have the earlier agreements
confirmed by the synod.<b><a href="#Note_71">[[71]]</a></b>
</p><p>Even as emperor Manuel remained a man of letters. Sometimes he complained
that his political obligations kept him from developing his artistic and
intellectual inclinations. After the death of his brother Theodore I of
Mistras in 1407, the emperor composed a funeral oration on his brother,<b><a href="#Note_72">[[72]]
</a></b>which
was directed to the humanist Manuel Chrysoloras, who composed a "position
paper" in response, in which he promised himself salvation of the empire
through reform of the school and educational system<b><a href="#Note_73">.[[73]]</a></b>
The Paris manuscript Cod. Gr.3041 was in Manuel's possession and contains
corrections in his own hand to his tractate on education, as well as a
large number of letters. The first part of the manuscript consists of a
corpus of sixty-three letters, among them twenty to his teacher Demetrius
Kydones, eight to Demetrius Chrysoloras and five to his brother, the humanist
Manuel Chrysoloras, who came to Florence in 1396 in order to teach Greek
there and in 1415 represented the Byzantine Empire at the council of Konstanz
and made particularly significant contributions to the early humanistic
efforts in Italy.<b><a href="#Note_74">[[74]]</a></b> Chrysoloras, acting
on Manuel's behalf, presented to the monastery of St. Denis a manuscript
with works attributed to Dionysius (=Denis) the Areopagite, containing
pictures of Manuel and his family, as well as of Chrysoloras (Musée
du Louvre, Ivoires A53, fol. 1.) One letter is addressed to the Italian
humanist Guarino. Further the manuscript contains a series of tractates,
such as a discourse on the Louvre's tapestries, <b><a href="#Note_75">[[75]]</a></b>
which he had been able to study when he visited Paris, a psalm on the death
of Bayazit, a tractate on marriage,<b><a href="#Note_76">[[76]] </a></b>and
a discourse on the siege of Thessaloniki. Of Manuel's lament on the metropolitan
Gabriel of Thessaloniki, who died between 1416 and 1419, only a few references
are preserved.<a href="#Note_77">[[77]]</a>
</p><p>Seven "<i>Orationes ethico-politica</i>e," addressed to<b><a href="johnVIII.html">
John VIII</a></b> belong to the category of "Mirrors for Princes,"<b> </b>(i.e.,
a sort of instruction book for medieval crown princes)<b> </b>as does an
address to loyal subjects<b><a href="#Note_78">.[[78]] </a></b>About the
same time he was writing the "Mirror for Princes" for his successor, in
a hundred chapters which are connected by acrostics.<b><a href="#Note_79">[[79]]</a></b>In
this piece the author employs all the old worn clichees and commonplaces.
Even Isocrates is cited, a rare event in Byzantine literature. Compared
with earlier "Mirrors for Princes" the heavy use of theological pronouncements
is striking<b><a href="#Note_80">.[[80]]</a></b> In total contrast to his
own practical action, the emperor stresses the fact that one should not
oppose oneself to the church's teachings. He likewise emphasizes that even
a ruler owes obedience to the church. God accepts gifts through the hands
of the poor. Manuel stresses free will and treats original sin and grace
through baptism. Men are slaves to sin. Manuel advises his son frequently
to examine his conscience. Man's goal lies in the hereafter. To the four
cardinal virtues he adds love (agape) and moderation (metriotes) and encourages
ascetic temperance. In the relation of state and church he emphasizes the
church's eternity, and warns against any confrontation with it. He compares
life to a sea voyage. As lawgiver and judge the emperor should emulate
the Judge of All, who should be for the emperor model, guideline, and law.
Just as in the sixty-eight preserved letters between 1383 and 1417 few
specific, day-to-day news items are to be found, so also in his theoretical
writings the emperor distances himself from every-day reality. The work
thus belongs to the genre of the customary medieval Byzantine "Mirrors
for Princes." It is preserved in Vienna manuscript gr. 89, from the estate
of Cardinal Bessarion of Trapezus, which also contains a bunch of other
writings by the emperor. The emperor's writings permit an excellent glimpse
into the mental world of the later Palaiologian period in the last decades
before the conquest of the empire by the Turks. Because of the partial
edition of the emperor's works in Migne's "Patrologia Graeca" (vol. 156),
they became a topic of discussion again in the nineteenth century. The
great monograph by John W. Barker in 1969 established a lasting monument
to this important emperor.
