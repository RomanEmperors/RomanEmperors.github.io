<p><strong>Introduction and Sources</strong></p>
<p>"During a happy period of more than fourscore years, the public administration was conducted by
the virtue and abilities of Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, and the two Antonines. It is the design of this
and of the two succeeding chapters to describe the prosperous condition of their empire, and
afterwards, from the death of Marcus Antoninus, to deduce the most important circumstances of
its decline and fall, a revolution which will ever be remembered and is still felt by the nations of
the earth." <b><a href="#N_1_">[[1]]</a></b></p>
<p>This is perhaps the most important and best known of all Edward Gibbon's famous <em>dicta</em> about his
vast subject, and particularly that period which he admired the most. It was a concatenation of
chance and events which brought to the first position of the principate five men, each very
different from the others, who each, in his own way, brought integrity and a sense of public duty
to his tasks. <a href="nerva.html"><b>Nerva's</b></a> tenure was brief, as many no doubt had expected and hoped it would be, and
perhaps his greatest achievement was to choose Trajan as his adoptive son and intended
successor. It was a splendid choice. Trajan was one of Rome's most admirable figures, a man who
merited the renown which he enjoyed in his lifetime and in subsequent generations.</p>
<p>The sources for the man and his principate are disappointingly skimpy. There is no
contemporaneous historian who can illuminate the period. Tacitus speaks only occasionally of
Trajan, there is no biography by Suetonius, nor even one by the author of the late and largely
fraudulent <em>Historia Augusta</em>. (However, a modern version of what such a life might have been like
has been composed by A. Birley, entirely based upon ancient evidence. It is very useful.) Pliny the
Younger tells us the most, in his <em>Panegyricus</em>, his long address of thanks to the emperor upon
assuming the consulship in late 100, and in his letters. Pliny was a wordy and congenial man, who
reveals a great deal about his senatorial peers and their relations with the emperor, above all, of
course, his own. The most important part is the tenth book of his <em>Epistulae</em>, which contains the
correspondence between him, while serving in Bithynia, and the emperor, to whom he referred all
manner of problems, important as well as trivial. Best known are the pair (96,97) dealing with the
Christians and what was to be done with them. These would be extraordinarily valuable if we
could be sure that the imperial replies stemmed directly from Trajan, but that is more than one can
claim.  The imperial chancellery had developed greatly in previous decades and might pen these
communications after only the most general directions from the emperor. The letters are
nonetheless unique in the insight they offer into the emperor's mind. <a href="#N_2_"><b>[[2]]</b></a></p>
<p>Cassius Dio, who wrote in the decade of the 230s, wrote a long imperial history which has
survived only in abbreviated form in book LXVIII for the Trajanic period. <a href="#N_3_"><b>[[3]]</b></a> The rhetorician Dio
of Prusa, a contemporary of the emperor, offers little of value. Fourth-century epitomators,
Aurelius Victor and Eutropius, offer some useful material. Inscriptions, coins, papyri, and legal
texts are of major importance. Since Trajan was a builder of many significant projects,
archaeology contributes mightily to our understanding of the man.</p>
<p><strong>Early Life and Career</strong></p>
<p>The <em>patria </em>of the Ulpii was Italica, in Spanish Baetica <a href="#N_4_"><b>[[4]]</b></a>, where their ancestors had settled late in
the third century B.C. Trajan's father was the first member of the family to pursue a senatorial
career; it proved to be a very successful one. Born probably about the year 30, he perhaps
commanded a legion under Corbulo in the early sixties and then was legate of <em>legio X Fretensis</em>
under<a href="vespasia.html"><b> Vespasian</b></a>, governor of Judaea. Success in the Jewish War was rewarded by the
governorship of an unknown province and then a consulate in 70. He was thereafter adlected by
the emperor <em>in patricios</em> and sent to govern Baetica. Then followed the governorship of one of the
major military provinces, Syria, where he prevented a Parthian threat of invasion, and in 79/80 he
was <em>proconsul</em> of Asia, one of the two provinces (the other was Africa) which capped a senatorial
career.   His public service now effectively over, he lived on in honor and distinction, in all likelihood
seeing his son emperor.  He probably died before 100. He was deified in 113 and his titulature
read <em>divus Traianus pater</em>. Since his son was also the adoptive son of Nerva, the emperor had
officially two fathers, a unique circumstance. <a href="#N_5_"><b>[[5]]</b></a></p>
<p>The son was born in Italica on September 18, 53; his mother was Marcia, who had given birth to a
daughter, Ulpia Marciana, five years before the birth of the son. In the mid seventies, he was a
legionary legate under his father in Syria. He then married a lady from Nemausus (Nimes) in Gallia
Narbonensis, Pompeia Plotina, was quaestor about 78 and praetor about 84. In 86, he became one
of the child <a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian's</b></a> guardians. He was then appointed legate of <em>legio VII Gemina</em> in Hispania
Tarraconensis, from which he marched at <a href="domitian.html"><b>Domitian's</b></a> orders in 89 to crush the uprising of
<a href="domitian.htm#Note_X"><b>Antonius Saturninus</b></a> along the Rhine. He next fought in Domitian's war against the Germans
along Rhine and Danube and was rewarded with an ordinary consulship in 91. Soon followed the
governorship of Moesia inferior and then that of Germania superior, with his headquarters at
Moguntiacum (Mainz), whither <a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian</b></a> brought him the news in autumn 97 that he had been
adopted by the emperor <a href="nerva.html"><b>Nerva</b></a>, as co-ruler and intended successor. Already recipient of the title
<em>imperator</em> and possessor of the tribunician power, when Nerva died on January 27, 98, Trajan
became emperor in a smooth transition of power which marked the next three quarters of a
century.</p>
<p><strong>Early Years through the Dacian Wars</strong></p>
<p>Trajan did not return immediately to Rome. He chose to stay in his German province and settle
affairs on that frontier. He showed that he approved <a href="domitian.html"><b>Domitian's</b></a> arrangements, with the
establishment of two provinces, their large military garrisons, and the beginnings of the <em>limes</em>. <a href="#N_6_"><b>[[6]]</b></a>
Those who might have wished for a renewed war of conquest against the Germans were
disappointed. The historian Tacitus may well have been one of these. <a href="#N_7_"><b>[[7]]</b></a></p>
<p>Trajan then visited the crucial Danube provinces of Pannonia and Moesia, where the Dacian king
Decebalus had caused much difficulty for the Romans and had inflicted a heavy defeat upon a
Roman army about a decade before. <a href="domitian.html"><b>Domitian</b></a> had established a <em>modus vivendi</em> with Decebalus,
essentially buying his good behavior, but the latter had then continued his activities hostile to
Rome. Trajan clearly thought that this corner of empire would require his personal attention and a
lasting and satisfactory solution. <a href="#N_8_"><b>[[8]]</b></a></p>
<p>Trajan spent the year 100 in Rome, seeing to the honors and deification of his predecessor,
establishing good and sensitive relations with the senate, in sharp contrast with <a href="domitian.html"><b>Domitian's </b></a>"war
against the senate." <a href="#N_9_"><b>[[9]]</b></a> Yet his policies essentially continued <a href="domitian.html"><b>Domitian's</b></a>; he was no less master of
the state and the ultimate authority over individuals, but his good nature and respect for those
who had until recently been his peers if not his superiors won him great favor. <a href="#N_10_"><b>[[10]]</b></a> He was called
<em>optimus </em>by the people and that word began to appear among his titulature, although it had not
been decreed by the senate. Yet his thoughts were ever on the Danube. Preparations for a great
campaign were under way, particularly with transfers of legions and their attendant auxiliaries
from Germany and Britain and other provinces and the establishment of two new ones, <em>II Traiana</em>
and <em>XXX Ulpia</em>, which brought the total muster to 30, the highest number yet reached in the
empire's history.</p>
<p>In 101 the emperor took the field. The war was one which required all his military abilities and all
the engineering and discipline for which the Roman army was renowned. Trajan was fortunate to
have Apollodorus of Damascus in his service, who built a roadway through the Iron Gates by
cantilevering it from the sheer face of the rock so that the army seemingly marched on water. He
was also to build a great bridge across the Danube, with 60 stone piers (traces of this bridge still
survive). When Trajan was ready to move he moved with great speed, probably driving into the
heart of Dacian territory with two columns, until, in 102, Decebalus chose to capitulate. He
prostrated himself before Trajan and swore obedience; he was to become a client king. Trajan
returned to Rome and added the title <em>Dacicus</em> to his titulature.</p>
<p>Decebalus, however, once left to his own devices, undertook to challenge Rome again, by raids
across the Danube into Roman territory and by attempting to stir up some of the tribes north of
the river against her. Trajan took the field again in 106, intending this time to finish the job of
Decebalus' subjugation. It was a brutal struggle, with some of the characteristics of a war of
extirpation, until the Dacian king, driven from his capital of Sarmizegethusa and hunted like an
animal, chose to commit suicide rather than to be paraded in a Roman triumph and then be put to
death.</p>
<p>The war was over. It had taxed Roman resources, with 11 legions involved, but the rewards were
great. Trajan celebrated a great triumph, which lasted 123 days and entertained the populace with
a vast display of gladiators and animals. The land was established as a province, the first on the
north side of the Danube. Much of the native population which had survived warfare was killed or
enslaved, their place taken by immigrants from other parts of the empire. The vast wealth of
Dacian mines came to Rome as war booty, enabling Trajan to support an extensive building
program almost everywhere, but above all in Italy and in Rome. In the capital, Apollodorus
designed and built in the huge forum already under construction a sculpted column, precisely 100
Roman feet high, with 23 spiral bands filled with 2500 figures, which depicted, like a scroll being
unwound, the history of both Dacian wars. It was, and still is, one of the great achievements of
imperial "propaganda." <a href="#N_11_"><b>[[11]]</b></a> In southern Dacia, at Adamklissi, a large <em>tropaeum</em> was built on a
hill, visible from a great distance, as a tangible statement of Rome's domination. Its effect was
similar to that of <a href="auggie.html"><b>Augustus'</b></a> monument at La Turbie above Monaco; both were constant reminders
for the inhabitants who gazed at it that they had once been free and were now subjects of a greater
power. <a href="#N_12_"><b>[[12]]</b></a></p>
<p><strong>Administration and Social Policy</strong></p>
<p>The chief feature of Trajan's administration was his good relations with the senate, which allowed
him to accomplish whatever he wished without general opposition. His <em>auctoritas</em> was more
important than his <em>imperium</em>. At the very beginning of Trajan's reign, the historian Tacitus, in the
biography of his father-in-law Agricola, spoke of the newly won compatibility of one-man rule and
individual liberty established by <a href="nerva.html"><b>Nerva</b></a> and expanded by Trajan (<em>Agr</em>. 3.1, <em>primo statim beatissimi
saeculi ortu Nerva Caesar res olim dissociabiles miscuerit, principatum ac libertatem, augeatque
cotidie felicitatem temporum Nerva Traianus, .</em>) [13]  At the end of the work, Tacitus
comments, when speaking of Agricola's death, that he had forecast the principate of Trajan but
had died too soon to see it (<em>Agr.</em> 44.5, <em>ei non licuit durare in hanc beatissimi saeculi lucem ac
principem Traianum videre, quod augurio votisque apud nostras aures ominabatur</em>, .) Whether
one believes that principate and liberty had truly been made compatible or not, this evidently was
the belief of the aristocracy of Rome. Trajan, by character and actions, contributed to this belief,
and he undertook to reward his associates with high office and significant promotions. During his
principate, he himself held only 6 consulates, while arranging for third consulates for several of his
friends.<a href="vespasia.html"><b> Vespasian</b></a> had been consul 9 times, <a href="titus.html"><b>Titus</b></a> 8, <a href="domitian.html"><b>Domitian</b></a> 17! In the history of the empire
there were only 12 or 13 <em>privati</em> who reached the eminence of third consulates. Agrippa had been
the first, <a href="vitell.html"><b>L. Vitellius</b></a> the second. Under Trajan there were 3: Sex. Iulius Frontinus (100), T.
Vestricius Spurinna (100), and L. Licinius Sura (107). There were also 10 who held second
consulships: L. Iulius Ursus Servianus (102), M.' Laberius Maximus (103), Q. Glitius Atilius
Agricola (103), P. Metilius Sabinus Nepos (103?), Sex. Attius Suburanus Aemilianus (104), Ti.
Iulius Candidus Marius Celsus (105), C. Antius A. Iulius Quadratus (105), Q. Sosius Senecio
(107), A. Cornelius Palma Frontonianus (109), and L. Publilius Celsus (113). These men were
essentially his close associates from pre-imperial days and his prime military commanders in the
Dacian wars.</p>
<p>One major administrative innovation can be credited to Trajan. This was the introduction of
<em>curatores</em> who, as representatives of the central government, assumed financial control of local
communities, both in Italy and the provinces. Pliny in Bithynia is the best known of these imperial
officials. The inexorable shift from freedmen to equestrians in the imperial ministries continued, to
culminate under Hadrian, <a href="#N_14_"><b>[[14]]</b></a> and he devoted much attention and considerable state resources to
the expansion of the alimentary system, which purposed to support orphans throughout Italy. <a href="#N_15_"><b>[[15]]</b></a>
The splendid arch at Beneventum represents Trajan as a civilian emperor, with scenes of ordinary
life and numerous children depicted, which underscored the prosperity of Italy. <a href="#N_16_"><b>[[16]]</b></a></p>
<p>The satirist Juvenal, a contemporary of the emperor, in one of his best known judgments, laments
that the citizen of Rome, once master of the world, is now content only with "bread and circuses."</p>

<p>Nam qui dabat olim / imperium, fasces, legiones, omnia, nunc se / continet, atque duas tantum res anxius optat, / panem et circenses.  (X 78-81)</p>

<p>Trajan certainly took advantage of that mood, indeed exacerbated it, by improving the reliabilty of
the grain supply (the harbor at Ostia and the distribution system as exemplified in the Mercati in
Rome). <a href="#N_17_"><b>[[17]</b></a>] Fronto did not entirely approve, if indeed he approved at all. <a href="#N_18_"><b>[[18]]</b></a> The plebs esteemed
the emperor for the glory he had brought Rome, for the great wealth he had won which he turned
to public uses, and for his personality and manner.  Though emperor, he prided himself upon being
<em>civilis</em>, a term which indicated comportment suitable for a Roman citizen. <a href="#N_19_"><b>[[19]]</b></a></p>
<p>There was only one major addition to the Rome's empire other than Dacia in the first decade and
a half of Trajan's reign. This was the province of Arabia, which followed upon the absorption of
the Nabataean kingdom (105-106). <a href="#N_20_"><b>[[20]]</b></a></p>
<p><strong>Building Projects</strong></p>
<p>Trajan had significant effect upon the infrastructure of both Rome and Italy. His greatest
monument in the city, if the single word "monument" can effectively describe the complex, was
the forum which bore his name, much the largest, and the last, of the series known as the "imperial
fora." Excavation for a new forum had already begun under <a href="domitian.html"><b>Domitian</b></a>, but it was Apollodorus
who designed and built the whole. Enormous in its extent, the Basilica Ulpia was the centerpiece,
the largest wood roofed building in the Roman world. In the open courtyard before it was an
equestrian statue of Trajan, behind it was the column; there were libraries, one for Latin scrolls,
the other for Greek, on each side. A significant omission was a temple; this circumstance was later
rectified by <a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian</b></a>, who built a large temple to the deified Trajan and Plotina.</p>
<p>The column was both a history in stone and the intended mausoleum for the emperor, whose ashes
were indeed placed in the column base. An inscription over the doorway, somewhat cryptic because part of the
text has disappeared, reads as follows:</p>
<p>Senatus populusque Romanus imp. Caesari divi Nervae f. Nervae Traiano Aug. Germ. Dacico
pontif. Maximo trib. pot. XVII imp. VI p.p. ad declarandum quantae altitudinis mons et locus
tant[is oper]ibus sit egestus</p>

<p>(Smallwood 378)</p>
<p>On the north side of the forum, built into the slopes of the Quirinal hill, were the Markets of
Trajan, which served as a shopping mall and the headquarters of the <em>annona</em>, the agency
responsible for the receipt and distribution of grain. <a href="#N_21_"><b>[[21]]</b></a></p>
<p>On the Esquiline hill was constructed the first of the huge imperial baths, using a large part of
<a href="nero.html"><b>Nero's</b></a> <em>Domus Aurea</em> as its foundations. On the other side of the river a new aqueduct was
constructed, which drew its water from Lake Bracciano and ran some 60 kilometers to the heights
of the Janiculum Hill. It was dedicated in 109. A section of its channel survives in the basement of
the American Academy in Rome. <a href="#N_22_"><b>[[22]]</b></a></p>
<p>The arch in Beneventum is the most significant monument elsewhere in Italy. It was dedicated in
114, to mark the beginning of the new Via Traiana, which offered an easier route to Brundisium
than that of the ancient Via Appia. <a href="#N_23_"><b>[[23]]</b></a></p>
<p>Trajan devoted much attention to the construction and improvement of harbors. His new
hexagonal harbor at Ostia at last made that port the most significant in Italy, supplanting Puteoli,
so that henceforth the grain ships docked there and their cargo was shipped by barge up the Tiber
to Rome. Terracina benefited as well from harbor improvements, and the Via Appia now ran
directly through the city along a new route, with some 130 Roman feet of sheer cliff being cut
away so that the highway could bend along the coast. Ancona on the Adriatic Sea became the
major harbor on that coast for central Italy in 114-115, and Trajan's activity was commemorated
by an arch. The inscription reports that the senate and people dedicated it to the <em>providentissimo
principi</em> <em>quod accessum Italiae hoc etiam addito ex pecunia sua portu tutiorem navigantibus
reddiderit</em> (Smallwood 387). Centumcellae, the modern Civitavecchia, also profited from a new
harbor. The emperor enjoyed staying there, and on at least one occasion summoned his <em>consilium</em>
there. <a href="#N_24_"><b>[[24]]</b></a></p>
<p>Elsewhere in the empire the great bridge at Alcantara in Spain, spanning the Tagus River, still in
use, <a href="#N_25_"><b>[[25]]</b></a> testifies to the significant attention the emperor gave to the improvement of
communication throughout his entire domain.</p>
<p><strong>Family Relations; the Women</strong></p>
<p>After the death of his father, Trajan had no close male relatives. His life was as closely linked with
his wife and female relations as that of any of his predecessors; these women played enormously
important roles in the empire's public life, and received honors perhaps unparalleled. His wife,
Pompeia Plotina, is reported to have said, when she entered the imperial palace in Rome for the
first time, that she hoped she would leave it the same person she was when she entered. <a href="#N_26_"><b>[[26]]</b></a> She
received the title <em>Augusta</em> no later than 105. She survived Trajan, dying probably in 121, and was
honored by <a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian</b></a> with a temple, which she shared with her husband, in the great forum which
the latter had built.</p>
<p>His sister Marciana, five years his elder, and he shared a close affection. She received the title
<em>Augusta</em>, along with Plotina, in 105 and was deified in 112 upon her death. Her daughter Matidia
became <em>Augusta</em> upon her mother's death, and in her turn was deified in 119. Both women
received substantial monuments in the Campus Martius, there being basilicas of each and a temple
of <em>divae Matidiae.</em> <a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian</b></a> was responsible for these buildings, which were located near the later
temple of the deified Hadrian, not far from the column of <a href="marcaur.html"><b>Marcus Aurelius</b></a>. <a href="#N_27_"><b>[[27]]</b></a></p>
<p>Matidia's daughter, Sabina, was married to <a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian</b></a> in the year 100. The union survived almost to
the end of Hadrian's subsequent principate, in spite of the mutual loathing that they had for each
other. Sabina was Trajan's great niece, and thereby furnished <a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian</b></a> a crucial link to Trajan.</p>
<p>The women played public roles as significant as any of their predecessors. They traveled with the
emperor on public business and were involved in major decisions. They were honored throughout
the empire, on monuments as well as in inscriptions. Plotina, Marciana, and Matidia, for example,
were all honored on the arch at Ancona along with Trajan. <a href="#N_28_"><b>[[28]]</b></a></p>
<p><strong>The Parthian War</strong></p>
<p>In 113, Trajan began preparations for a decisive war against Parthia. He had been a "civilian"
emperor for seven years, since his victory over the Dacians, and may well have yearned for a last,
great military achievement, which would rival that of Alexander the Great. Yet there was a
significant cause for war in the <em>Realpolitik</em> of Roman-Parthian relations, since the Parthians had
placed a candidate of their choice upon the throne of Armenia without consultation and approval
of Rome. When Trajan departed Rome for Antioch, in a leisurely tour of the eastern empire while
his army was being mustered, he probably intended to destroy at last Parthia's capabilities to rival
Rome's power and to reduce her to the status of a province (or provinces). It was a great
enterprise, marked by initial success but ultimate disappointment and failure.</p>
<p>In 114 he attacked the enemy through Armenia and then, over three more years, turned east and
south, passing through Mesopotamia and taking Babylon and the capital of Ctesiphon. He then is
said to have reached the Persian Gulf and to have lamented that he was too old to go further in
Alexander's footsteps. In early 116 he received the title <em>Parthicus</em>.</p>
<p>The territories, however, which had been handily won, were much more difficult to hold.
Uprisings among the conquered peoples, and particularly among the Jews in Palestine and the
Diaspora, caused him to gradually resign Roman rule over these newly-established provinces as he
returned westward. The revolts were brutally suppressed. In mid 117, Trajan, now a sick man,
was slowly returning to Italy, having left <a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian</b></a> in command in the east, when he died in Selinus
of Cilicia on August 9, having designated <a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian</b></a> as his successor while on his death bed. Rumor
had it that Plotina and Matidia were responsible for the choice, made when the emperor was
already dead. Be that as it may, there was no realistic rival to <a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian</b></a>, linked by blood and
marriage to Trajan and now in command of the empire's largest military forces. <a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian</b></a> received
notification of his designation on August 11, and that day marked his <em>dies imperii</em>. Among
<a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian's</b></a> first acts was to give up all of Trajan's eastern conquests.  <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Trajan's honors and reputation</strong></p>
<p><a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian</b></a> saw to it that Trajan received all customary honors: the late emperor was declared a
<em>divus</em>, his victories were commemorated in a great triumph, and his ashes were placed in the base
of his column. Trajan's reputation remained unimpaired, in spite of the ultimate failure of his last
campaigns. Early in his principate, he had unofficially been honored with the title <em>optimus</em>, "the
best," which long described him even before it became, in 114, part of his official titulature. His
correspondence with Pliny enables posterity to gain an intimate sense of the emperor in action. His
concern for justice and the well-being of his subjects is underscored by his comment to Pliny,
when faced with the question of the Christians, that they were not to be sought out, "nor is it
appropriate to our age." <a href="#N_29_"><b>[[29]]</b></a> At the onset of his principate, Tacitus called Trajan's accession the
beginning of a <em>beatissimum saeculum</em>, <a href="#N_30_"><b>[[30]]</b></a> and so it remained in the public mind. Admired by the
people, respected by the senatorial aristocracy, he faced no internal difficulties, with no rival nor
opposition. His powers were as extensive as <a href="domitian.html"><b>Domitian's</b></a> had been, but his use and display of these
powers were very different from those of his predecessor, who had claimed to be <em>deus et dominus</em>.
Not claiming to be a god, he was recognized in the official iconography of sculpture as Jupiter's
viceregent on earth, so depicted on the attic reliefs of the Beneventan arch. <a href="#N_31_"><b>[[31]]</b></a> The passage of
time increased Trajan's aura rather than diminished it. In the late fourth century, when the Roman
Empire had dramatically changed in character from what it had been in Trajan's time, each new
emperor was hailed with the prayer, <em>felicior Augusto, melior Traiano</em>, "may he be luckier than
Augustus and better than Trajan." <a href="#N_32_"><b>[[32]]</b></a> That reputation has essentially survived into the present
day. <strong></strong></p>
