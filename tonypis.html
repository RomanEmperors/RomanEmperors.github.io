<div><p><img src="/tonypis.gif" alt="Coin of Antoninus Pius"></p></div><p>                  <strong>Introduction</strong></p>







<p>The long reign of the emperor Antoninus Pius is often described as a



period of peace and quiet before the storm which followed and



plagued his successor, <a href="marcaur.html"><b>Marcus Aurelius</b></a>. In addition to the relative



peacefulness, this emperor set the tone for a low-keyed imperial



administration which differed markedly from those of his two



immediate predecessors, <a href="trajan.html"><b>Trajan</b></a> and 



<a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian</b></a>. Antoninus managed to



govern the empire capably and yet with such a gentle hand that he



earned the respect, acclaim, and love of his subjects.</p>







<p>     <strong>Early Life</strong></p>







<p>The future emperor was born T. Aurelius Fulvus Boionius Arrius



Antoninus on September 19, A.D. 86 at Lanuvium, an old Latin city



southeast of Rome.<a href="#N_1_"><b>[[1]]</b></a> His father's family 



had originally migrated to



Rome from Nemausus (Nîmes) in Narbonese Gaul, but his paternal



grandfather, T. Aurelius Fulvus, had served twice as Roman consul



and also as city prefect and his father, Aurelius Fulvus, also held the



consulship. The future emperor's mother was Arria Fadilla and her



father, Arrius Antoninus, had also been consul twice.<a href="#N_2_"><b>[[2]]</b></a> Young



Antoninus was raised at Lorium, on the via Aurelia, where he later



built a palace<a href="#N_3_"><b>[[3]]</b></a></p>







<p>                <strong>Career Under Hadrian</strong></p>







<p> Very little is known about Antoninus' life before he became



emperor. The brief  biography in the <i>Scriptores



Historiae Augustae</i> credited to Julius Capitolinus refers to his services as <i>quaestor</i>,



 <i>praetor,</i> and



<i>consul</i> and P. von Rohden's entry in <i>Pauly-Wissowa</i> dates his tenure



of these offices to A.D. 112, 117, and 120 respectively.<a href="#N_4_"><b>[[4]]</b></a> At some



point between A.D. 110 and 115, Antoninus married Annia Galeria



Faustina, the daughter of M. Annius Verus.<a href="#N_5_"><b>[[5]]</b></a> Hadrian later



appointed Antoninus as one of his consular administrators of Italy



and between A.D. 130 and 135 Antoninus served as proconsul of



Asia.<a href="#N_6_"><b>[[6]]</b></a></p>







<p>Antoninus had achieved a distinguished career under 



<a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian</b></a>. and



could have retired from imperial service with great pride, but events



in A.D. 138 changed Antoninus' future quite radically.  Early in the



year, the death of Aelius Verus, whom <a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian</b></a>



 had previously



adopted and named Caesar, opened a new path. <a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian</b></a> met with



the Senate and announced his decision to adopt Antoninus as his son



and heir and to share both proconsular and tribunician power with



him.<a href="#N_7_"><b>[[7]]</b></a> After giving this offer careful thought, Antoninus accepted



and agreed in return to adopt as his heirs his wife's nephew, M.



Antoninus, the future <a href="marcaur.html"><b>Marcus Aurelius</b></a>,



 and <a href="lverus.html"><b>L. Verus</b></a>, the son of



Aelius Verus.<a href="#N_8_"><b>[[8]]</b></a> </p>







<p><strong>Imperial Reign</strong></p>







<p>When <a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian</b></a> died in the following



 summer, Antoninus oversaw the



conveyance of his body from Baiae to Rome for interment in the



new imperial tomb (now Castel Sant' Angelo). To honor his



adoptive father, Antoninus set up a magnificent shield, established a



priesthood, and, against serious opposition in the Senate, requested



and bargained for senatorial confirmation of 



<a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian's</b></a> deification.<a href="#N_9_"><b>[[9]]</b></a>



Antoninus' devotion to <a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian's</b></a> memory is one of the reasons cited



for the Senate's bestowal upon the new emperor of the name



"<i>pius</i>".<a href="#N_10_"><b>[[10]]</b></a> After initially refusing



 the Senate's recognition of



Antoninus as "<i>pater patriae</i>", the new emperor accepted the honor



with thanks.<a href="#N_11_"><b>[[11]]</b></a> He declined, however, the



 Senate's decree



authorizing the renaming of the months of September and October



after the new emperor and empress.<a href="#N_12_"><b>[[12]]</b></a> The Senate did honor the



new empress with the title of "Augusta".<a href="#N_13_"><b>[[13]]</b></a> 



On her death only a few



years later in A.D. 141, the Senate deified Faustina and voted her a



temple and priestesses.<a href="#N_14_"><b>[[14]]</b></a> In memory of his



 wife, Antoninus also



instituted an alimentary program, similar to those of his immediate



predecessors, which combined loans to Italian farmers with funds,



generated by interest on those loans, set aside for the care of



orphaned girls. On coins these orphans are designated as <i>puellae



Faustinianae</i>.<a href="#N_15_"><b>[[15]]</b></a></p>







<p>Antoninus returned all of Italy's share of the <i>aurum coronarium</i>,



 the



money raised in honor of his accession, and one-half of that



contributed from the provinces.<a href="#N_16_"><b>[[16]]</b></a> His economic policy in general



was relatively conservative and avoided luxurious waste while



supporting public works of practical application.<a href="#N_17_"><b>[[17]]</b></a> His procurators



were told to keep provincial tribute reasonable and they were held



accountable for exceeding fixed bounds. The provinces in general



prospered under his administration and the use of informers was



ended.<a href="#N_18_"><b>[[18]]</b></a> Julius Capitolinus summarizes the



 excellence of Antoninus'



administration when he says: "With such care did he govern all



peoples under him that he looked after all things and all men as if



they were his own." <a href="#N_19_"><b>[[19]]</b></a> In spite of his 



caution in raising imperial



revenues, however, Antoninus provided regular gifts of money to



the people and to the soldiers and produced spectacular public



games with a great variety of animals on display.<a href="#N_20_"><b>[[20]]</b></a> The emperor



also used his own funds to distribute oil, grain, and wine free in a



time of famine and helped relieve the devastation caused in Rome by



fire, flood, and a collapse of stands in the Circus Maximus and by



fires and earthquakes in the provinces.<a href="#N_21_"><b>[[21]]</b></a></p>







<p>Although the reigns of his two immediate predecessors, <a href="trajan.html"><b>Trajan</b></a> and



<a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian</b></a>, had seen prolific building 



activity in Rome and throughout



the empire, Antoninus chose to be less lavish in his public works



projects. He felt an obligation to complete work begun or promised



by <a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian</b></a>. Antoninus completed the 



Mausoleum of Hadrian along



the Tiber and built the temples of the Divine Hadrian in the Campus



Martius and of Faustina in the Forum.<a href="#N_22_"><b>[[22]]</b></a> He also restored  the oldest



bridge in Rome, the <i>Pons Sublicius</i>, the Graecostadium, and the



Colosseum. He may even have put some finishing touches on the



Pantheon because Julius Capitolinus mentions restoration of  a



<i>templum Agrippae</i>, but the text may be corrupt and the temple of



the Divine Augustus, the restoration of which is recorded on some



of Antoninus' coins, may be the intended reference here.<a href="#N_23_"><b>[[23]]</b></a> 



 Outside



Rome, Antoninus repaired several roads and renovated ports in



Alexandria, Caieta, and Terracina, a bath at Ostia, an aqueduct at



Antium, and the temples in his birthplace, Lanuvium.



<a href="#N_24_"><b>[[24)]]</b></a></p>







<p>Although some sources suggest that Antoninus went in person to



Egypt and Syria to put down a revolt of peoples along the Red Sea,



Julius Capitolinus says that Antoninus made his home in Rome



where he could receive messages from all parts of the empire equally



quickly . He also states that to avoid burdening the provinces with



the expenses of housing an emperor and his associates Antoninus



took expeditions out of Rome only to his estates in Campania.



<a href="#N_25_"><b>[[25]]</b></a> If



correct, these actions marked a decided break with the visibility of



his two predecessors in the provinces and recreated a more Rome-



and Italy-centered empire. Wilhelm Weber commented on this



policy: "As if, perhaps, in criticism of Hadrian's conception of his



task, he sat like a beneficent spider at the centre of his web, power



radiating steadily from him to the farthest bounds of the empire and



as steadily returning to him again. For the last time in Imperial



history the Emperor was wholly one with Rome and its



centralization."<a href="#N_26_"><b>[[26]]</b></a>   </p>







<p>During his third consulship (A.D. 140-144), Antoninus issued a



series of unusual coins and medallions which featured entirely new



or modified religious/mythological images.<a href="#N_27_"><b>[[27]]</b></a> Jocelyn Toynbee



correctly pointed out that these types were issued to prepare for the



celebration of Rome's nine hundredth birthday in A.D. 147/148 and



she also discussed two images which represent the emperor's



reaction against <a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian's</b></a> "cosmopolitanism" and his attempt to



restore Rome and Italy to a superior position over the provinces.<a href="#N_28_"><b>[[28]]</b></a>



This unusual series, issued especially in bronze, commemorated



Rome's connection to her distant roots from Trojans, Latins, and



Sabines and honored gods who had protected the city in the past.



Themes associated with Aeneas, Romulus, Numa Pompilius, and



<a href="auggie.html"><b>Augustus</b></a> by implication tied in Antoninus



 as successor to these four



model Roman leaders. Although the death of Faustina may have



motivated Antoninus' display of public piety to some degree on these



coins and medallions, the series also set the tone for the games and



rituals of the birthday celebration in 147/148, renewed religious



values, and restored Rome's proper relationship with protective gods



who had brought the city past success both in war and in peace.<a href="#N_29_"><b>[[29]]</b></a>



Another series of coins, the "anonymous quadrantes", combines a



portrait of a god or goddess on the obverse with a reverse symbol of



an animal associated with the same deity. The absence of an imperial



portrait or any inscription aside from the <i>S.C.</i> authorization of the



Senate makes it especially difficult to date this series. However, the



similarity of the Jupiter and Venus portraits to images of Antoninus



and Faustina and other links to Antoninus' coin-types make it



probable that several of these types were issued in Antoninus' reign,



perhaps again in connection with Rome's birthday celebration in



A.D. 147/148.<a href="#N_30_"><b>[[30]]</b></a></p>







<p>Although Antoninus' reign was generally peaceful, Capitolinus says



that he fought wars, through legates, against the Britons, Moors,



Germans, Dacians, and the Alans and suppressed revolts in Achaea,



in Egypt, and among the Jews.<a href="#N_31_"><b>[[31]]</b></a> 



The war in Britain was fought



around A.D. 142 against the Brigantes and led to the construction of



the Antonine Wall across the island as a second line of defense north



of Hadrian's Wall.<a href="#N_32_"><b>[[32]]</b></a> In foreign relations,



 the emperor's authority



was respected among peoples bordering on the empire. Antoninus



approved the appointment of kings for the Armenians, for the Lazi,



and for the Quadi and he successfully prevented a Parthian attack on



Armenia by sending the Parthian king a letter of warning.



<a href="#N_33_"><b>[[33]]</b></a> </p>







<p>Antoninus did continue his predecessor's interest in law and his



imperial legislation is cited frequently in Justinian's <i>Digest</i>. Several



lawyers served in the emperor's <i>consilium</i> and presumably advised



him on legal matters. Antoninus' legislation included protections for



slaves, freedmen, and for illegitimate children and further defined



family and inheritance law, including consideration of a daughter's



wishes in marriage arrangements.<a href="#N_34_"><b>[[34]]</b></a></p>







<p>In preparation for the succession, Antoninus' daughter Faustina



married <a href="marcaur.html"><b>Marcus Aurelius</b></a> in A.D. 145 and she soon became Augusta



in place of her deceased mother. <a href="marcaur.html"><b>Marcus Aurelius</b></a> was associated in



imperial powers and he and <a href="lverus.html"><b>L. Verus</b></a> both held the consulship



multiple times in preparation for their accession.



<a href="#N_35_"><b>[[35]]</b></a> Antoninus made



sure that he would leave the Empire secure and in sound financial



condition and his adopted sons inherited a large surplus (reportedly



675 million <i>denarii</i>) in the Treasury .<a href="#N_36_"><b>[[36]]</b></a></p>







<p>Antoninus Pius died in March of A.D. 161, after giving the



appropriate imperial watchword which so typified his reign,



"equanimity". He was soon afterward deified by the Senate. His



adopted sons and successors, <a href="marcaur.html"><b>Marcus Aurelius</b></a> and



 <a href="lverus.html"><b>Lucius Verus</b></a>,



erected a column of red granite in his honor in the Campus Martius.



The marble base for this column, which is preserved in the Vatican,



includes a sculpted image of the apotheosis of Antoninus and



Faustina.<a href="#N_37_"><b>[[37]]</b></a> In his <i>Meditations</i>,



 <a href="marcaur.html"><b>Marcus Aurelius</b></a> expressed his



enduring love and respect for his adoptive father: "Do all things as a



disciple of Antoninus. Think of his constancy in every act rationally



undertaken, his invariable equability, his piety, his serenity of



countenance, his sweetness of disposition, his contempt for the



bubble of fame, and his zeal for getting a true grasp of affairs."



<a href="#N_38_"><b>[[38]]</b></a> In



many ways Antoninus Pius was a model emperor who justifiably 



earned comparison with his own model, Numa Pompilius, and



provided the Empire with a period of fortune, religious piety, and



security perhaps unmatched in imperial annals.<a href="#N_39_"><b>[[39]]</b></a> </p>
