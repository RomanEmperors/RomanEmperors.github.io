<h3>
<b>Zoe Porphyrogenita (wife of Romanus III, Constantine IX, and Michael
IV)</b></h3></center>

<center><b>Lynda Garland</b>
<br><b>University of New England, Australia</b></center>

<p>The sisters Zoe and <b><a href="theodorap.html">Theodora</a></b>, as
nieces of the childless <b><a href="basilii.html">Basil II</a> </b>and daughters
of his younger brother <b><a href="connieVIII.html">Constantine VIII</a></b>
and Helena Alypia, were the only heirs to the Macedonian dynasty in the
new generation. They were also its last representatives. While <b><a href="theodorap.html">Theodora</a></b>
was later to reign briefly in her own right, it was Zoe who was initially
given the chance to secure the future of the imperial family, a chance
which she embraced with enthusiasm. Like many a twenty-first century starlet,
she married three husbands, adopted a likely young lad as her son and heir,
and indulged in numerous affairs. As the embodiment of the dynasty, Zoe
legitimised the reign of each of her three husbands, who received the throne
by right of marriage to her, and like her grandmother <b><a href="theophano.html">Theophano</a></b>
was implicated in the decease of one of these husbands, whose presence
she considered to have become superfluous to requirements. Immensely popular
with the inhabitants of the capital, she was protected by them when her
position was threatened, despite the fact that she was not only childless
but frivolous and extravagant as well, with no concern for the realities
of government. But her status was assured by the fact that she (and not
her connections by marriage) was the 'Macedonian' and heir of <b><a href="basilii.html">Basil
II</a></b>. Though she had no taste for administration or the details of
government, Zoe was not helpless: as well as her role in the death of her
first and elderly husband <b><a href="romanusiii.html">Romanus III Argyrus</a></b>,
she was reported to have plotted against her second husband, <b><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael
IV</a></b>, when he restricted her activities, and against her adopted
son <b><a href="mikev.html">Michael V</a></b>, when he too sidelined her
from the centre of government, as well as having attempted to have poisoned
her husband's brother, John the <i>Orphanotrophus</i>, one of the highest-ranking
administrators of the empire.
</p><center>
<p><b>The death of Constantine VIII</b></p></center>

<p><b><a href="connieVIII.html">Constantine VIII</a></b> succeeded his brother
<b><a href="basilii.html">Basil
II</a></b> in 1025.
<b><a href="basilii.html">Basil</a></b> had never married,
and <b><a href="connieVIII.html">Constantine</a></b> had only three daughters,
yet neither brother seems to have made any other provision for the succession.
The eldest of the three daughters, Eudocia, had suffered an attack of smallpox
during her childhood which had disfigured her appearance. She had always
been unlike the rest of her family in her gentleness and quiet disposition,
and as a result of her illness had entered a convent.<b><a href="#N_1_">[[1]]</a></b>
The remaining sisters were forced to reside in the women's quarters of
the palace until their fathe<span size="-1">r
<b><a href="connieVIII.html">Co</a></b></span><a href="connieVIII.html"><b>nstantine</b>
</a>was close to death in 1028. While the exact date of Zoe's birth is
not known, she was clearly born c. AD 978, as Psellus states that she was
seventy-two years of age when she died in AD 1050, and so may already have
been in her fiftieth year at this point.<b><a href="#N_2_">[[2]]</a></b>
The lethargy of both
<b><a href="basilii.html">Basil</a></b> and, <b><a href="connieVIII.html">Constantine</a></b>
in arranging matches for the younger generation is therefore unaccountable,
for even at <b><a href="basilii.html">Basil's</a></b> death, when Zoe might
have expected to be married off, she was in her later forties, which is
hardly the best age at which to start bearing children. As it was, Zoe
and her younger sister had remained unwed, while their relationship not
unnaturally developed into a state of mutual irritation and animosity which
is confirmed by all sources. Indeed, Zoe seems to have been intensely jealous
of Theodora.<b><a href="#N_3_">[[3]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times">Hope for the future</span></b></p></center>

<p><span face="Times">One positive light had shone on Zoe's youth, for
a marriage had been arranged for one of the sisters, presumably Zoe, with
Otto III, the western emperor. Otto was himself the son of the Byzantine
princess Theophano, niece of <b><a href="johnItz.html">John I Tzimisces</a></b>,
who had married Otto II in St Peter's in Rome in 972.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_4_">][4]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Regrettably the highly eligible young bridegroom (Otto had been born in
980) had died before the princess arrived at Bari in February 1002, and
she had had to turn round and come home again.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_5_">[[5]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Such an opportunity would not reoccur. In any case this marriage would
not have solved the problem of the succession, and&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basilii.hrm">Basil's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
unwillingness to find suitable matches at home for his nieces may have
been due to some reluctance of his to allow other noble families access
to power. Certainly, Psellus tells us, the rebel Bardas Sclerus had advised
<b><a href="basilii.html">Basil&nbsp;</a></b>
to 'admit no woman to the imperial councils', while Basil's reluctance
to take a wife himself may have been due to a monastic vow he took early
in his reign in the face of military defeat.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_6_">[[6]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
The girls therefore spent a lonely life in the palace for several decades,
until <b><a href="connieVIII.html">Constantine VIII</a></b>, who is portrayed
as concerned primarily with the pleasures of life,<sup> </sup></span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_7_">][7]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
was at death's door, when clearly some measure had to be taken with expedition.</span>
</p><p><span face="Times"><a href="connieVIII.html"><b>Constantine</b> </a>had
a little time in which to survey possible candidates. Initially, his first
choice was Constantine Dalassenus, who had been governor of Antioch in
1025, but he then changed his mind and decided on <b><a href="romanusiii.html">Romanus
Argyrus</a></b>, the eparch (prefect of the city), who was widely tipped
as the favourite candidate.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_8_">[[8]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
The family of the Argyri were both noble and wealthy, and Romanus' sister
Maria Argyropoulaina had been chosen by <b><a href="basilii.html">Basil
II</a></b> as a suitable bride for the son of Peter II Orseolo, the doge
of Venice, in 1005. Maria's use of rose-water, forks, and incense was seen
as blasphemous and arrogant by local clerics, such as Peter Damian, and
her death from plague in 1006 was thought to have been a righteous judgement
upon her.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_9_">[[9[[</a></span></b><span face="Times">
All in all, Zoe, with her love of luxury and pleasure, might not have received
a very warm welcome in the West.</span>
</p><p>Romanus had been born c. 968 (Psellus records that he was more than
ten
years older than Zoe), and certainly, at sixty or more, he was no spring
chicken -- but then neither was Zoe.<b><a href="#N_10_">[[10]]</a></b>
A greater obstacle was the fact that he was already married. Constantine
VIII had a reputation for brutality and a short temper, and he was not
going to let this stop him. Romanus' wife Helena was informed that she
had to retire immediately to a convent and take the veil as a nun (thus
releasing Romanus from his marriage);<b><a href="#N_11_">[[11]]</a></b>
if she refused to do so, her husband would be blinded. This loving wife
put her husband's interests first and prudently withdrew to a monastic
institution, under the new name of Maria. Romanus and Zoe were married
forthwith and crowned in November 1028, three days before Constantine's
death on 12 November 1028. Interestingly, Romanus clearly valued his wife's
self-sacrifice: he gave Helena-Maria the title of <i>sebaste</i> (an honorific
title, which originally was a translation of Augusta into Greek). He also
made huge charitable donations on her death.<b><a href="#N_12_">[[12]]</a></b>
Zoe does not seem to have made (or felt) any objections to the match. Scylitzes
and Zonaras, however, record that in contrast Theodora had originally been
given the choice of marrying Romanus, but had enough scruples to decline
it, either because of the degree of kinship between them (they were cousins
in the seventh degree), or because Romanus' wife was still alive and she
had not freely chosen the divorce.<b><a href="#N_13_">[[13]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times">The first marriage</span></b></p></center>

<p><span face="Times">After fifty years in the women's quarters, broken
only by the brief sea trip to Bari, Zoe had a lot of wasted time to make
up for. One of her first actions was to ensure that <b><a href="theodorap.html">Theodora</a></b>
retired from court to the convent of Petrion: there was only room at court
for one empress, and that was Zoe herself.<sup> </sup><b><a href="romanusiii.html">Romanus</a></b>,
however, ensured that <b><a href="theodorap.html">Theodora</a></b> was granted
certain imperial favours, despite her possible involvement on two occasions
in the conspiratorial activities of Constantine Diogenes while </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romanusiii.html">Romanus</a></span></b><span face="Times">
was away on campaign, incidents that Zoe dealt with in her husband's absence.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_14_">[[14]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">Z</span>oe was every inch an empress, and very much
like her father -- arrogantly regal, short-tempered and quite prepared
to have people blinded at the slightest provocation.<b><a href="#N_15_">[[15]]</a></b>
She was also extraordinarily extravagant, a characteristic she shared with
<b><a href="romanusiii.html">Romanus</a></b>
who desired to show himself a great builder, general, and administrator.
<b><a href="basilii.html">Basil II</a></b> had left 200,000 talents in the
treasury, and they showed a spirited determination to spend the lot.<b><a href="#N_16_">[[16]]</a></b>
Quite naturally, they also shared a common desire to continue the dynasty.
They consulted medical experts, and Zoe took to the use of magic amulets
and other non-mainstream practices. When no children eventuated, <b><a href="romanusiii.html">Romanus</a></b>
made the mistake of considering Zoe rather an embarrassment: he ignored
her, stopped sleeping with her, and publicly took a mistress.<b><a href="#N_17_">[[17]]</a></b>
To make matters even worse, he forbade her access to the treasury and made
her keep to a fixed allowance.<b><a href="#N_18_">[[18]]</a></b> This was
the ultimate insult -- after all <b><a href="romanusiii.html">Romanus</a></b>
was only emperor by right of his marriage to Zoe, who was the true Macedonian.
As the marriage careered towards breakdown, Zoe, in an imperial audience
one day, caught sight of a handsome young man in his twenties. This lucky
youth was <b><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael</a></b>, the brother of one of
the court's high-ranking eunuchs, John the <i>Orphanotrophus</i> ('director
of an orphanage'), who was actually in charge of the administration of
the empire and had brought his brother to court to further his interests.
Zoe was no shrinking violet: dazzled by <b><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael's</a></b>
attractions, she immediately invited him to visit her in her quarters and
propositioned him. Scylitzes calls her infatuation a 'demonic and mad love',
but psychologically Zoe was understandably ready for a passionate affair
with a 'toy boy'.
<b><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael's</a></b> reaction is
not so clear, though Psellus sees him as unwillingly suffering the empress'
attentions while bearing in mind the power and influence he would gain
through this relationship.<sup> </sup><b><a href="#N_19_">[[19]]</a> <a href="mikeiv.html">Michael's</a></b>
family too saw the empress' affection as a road to power, and his brother
John (whose experience in relationships at court had led him to anticipate
this outcome) instructed him on how best to please the empress. The court
was hardly a private place, especially for the imperial family: Zoe and
<b><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael</a></b>
were found together in a number of compromising situations (including in
bed). Zoe indeed was not concerned to conceal her feelings, and one unfortunate
eunuch was shocked to find her embracing
<b><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael</a>,
</b>who
was not only on the throne at the time but fully equipped with the imperial
sceptre, at which Zoe boasted that she could make him emperor -- indeed,
she had already made him so.<b><a href="#N_20_">[[20]]</a></b>
</p><p><b><a href="romanusiii.html">Romanus </a></b>was blind to the danger.
His redoubtable sister Pulcheria and her friends warned him of the possible
consequences, but he took no notice. Zoe was better kept occupied, and
the affair with <b><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael</a></b> consumed her time
and stopped her sleeping around more widely -- the names of Constantine
Catepanus and <b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine Monomachus</a></b>,
at least, were linked with hers at this time in this context.<b><a href="#N_21_">[[21]]</a></b>
With Zoe not concerned with concealment, the situation was publicly canvassed
at court and in the capital, yet <b><a href="romanusiii.html">Romanus </a></b>took
no steps against either party, and was satisfied with <b><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael's
</a></b>assurance
that he was not sleeping with the empress.<b><a href="#N_22_">[[22]]</a></b>
This was not a shrewd move. Zoe considered that she had wasted enough of
her youth and, after possibly trying to have <b><a href="romanusiii.html">Romanus</a></b>
poisoned, grew impatient for his termination and on Good Friday (11 April)
1034 had him drowned in his bath by <b><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael's </a></b>attendants.
She came in, took one look to make sure that he was actually dying, and
swept out to marry <a href="mikriv.html">Michael</a> and set him on the
throne that same night.<b><a href="#N_23_">[[23]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times">The second marriage</span></b></p></center>

<p><span face="Times">Zoe quite correctly saw herself as the embodiment
of legitimisation. With <b><a href="romanusiii.html">Romanus</a></b> dead,
whomever she next chose as her husband would automatically become emperor.
Entirely ignoring the prudent advice of her officials and retainers, she
had </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
proclaimed emperor that evening. The patriarch Alexius the Studite was
summoned to an audience with 'the emperor', and was thunder-struck to find
not <b><a href="romanusiii.html">Romanus</a></b> but
<b><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael</a></b>
on the throne next to Zoe. The payment of fifty lbs of gold to him and
another fifty to his clergy ensured his acquiescence in their marriage,</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_24_">[[24]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and the citizens happily acclaimed</span> <b><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael</a></b>
emperor on the following day<span face="Times"><span size="-1">.</span></span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_25_">[[25]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">As <b><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael IV Paphlagon</a></b>
('the Paphlagonian') the new emperor began by falling in with Zoe's wishes
and arranging various amusements for her.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_26_">[[26]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
There was, however, a snag: </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
suffered from epilepsy, and our sources suggest that this was intensified
by his feelings of guilt over </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romanusiii.html">Romanus</a></span></b><span face="Times">'
murder and over his perjury to </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romanusiii.html">Romanus</a></span></b><span face="Times">.
Psellus also suggests that </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael
</a></span></b><span face="Times">may have deliberately distanced himself
from Zoe because he did not want her to see him suffering an epileptic
fit.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_27_">[[27]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
On the pretext that Zoe was plotting against him he had her confined to
the women's quarters. Her visitors were restricted, her eunuchs and faithful
maid-servants dismissed, and she was confined to her rooms, </span>while
<b><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael</a></b>
stopped seeing her. According to Psellus, the emperor's family seems to
have felt some genuine apprehension of Zoe, viewing her in the role of
a potentially ferocious lioness.<b><a href="#N_28_">[[28]]</a></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">There is no evidence that Zoe had been involved in
a plot against Michael, but she may have seen <b><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael's</a></b>
brother John as her main enemy and Scylitzes reports that in 1037 she had
one of her eunuchs (Sgouritzes) bribe John's doctor to poison him instead
of giving him a purgative. The plot was uncovered when one of the doctor's
servants informed John, and the doctor was exiled, as was the courtier
(a <i>protospatharius</i>) who provided the poison, while Zoe from then
on was more closely supervised.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_29_">[[29]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">As <b><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael's</a></b> life
expectancy was short due to his epilepsy, his family was concerned to line
up a successor. Perhaps in 1035 John (who was now in charge of government)
suggested to Zoe that she adopt one of their nephews, another <b><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael</a></b>,
as her heir. This
<b><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael</a></b>, known derisively
as Calaphates ('the Caulker') from his father's trade, was proclaimed Caesar,
thus securing the family's fortunes.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_30_">[[30]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
T</span>he new heir felt no gratitude: rather he determined to plot against
both his uncle John and the empress.<b><a href="#N_31_">[[31]]</a></b>
In the face of approaching death, <b><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael IV</a></b>&nbsp;
rebuilt the grand church and monastery of Sts Cosmas and Damian, which
he entered as a monk before his death on 10 December 1041.<b><a href="#N_32_">[[32]]</a></b>
Zoe clearly had more freedom of movement at this point, for at the news
that he was dying she was so overcome by emotion that she forgot all his
ill-treatment of her and crossed the city without her retinue and on foot
(Psellus is greatly shocked at this), to see him for one last time: however,
sadly, he refused to let her be admitted.<b><a href="#N_33_">[[33]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times">The adopted son</span></b></p></center>

<p>Between 10 and 13 December 1041 power reverted to Zoe, though after
consideration she agreed to the young <b><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael</a></b>
assuming the throne. John and his family flattered her and swore that <b><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael</a></b>
would be emperor only in name and that he would follow all her orders,
treating her 'as sovereign lady, mistress, and mother'.<b><a href="#N_34_">[[34]]</a></b>
Once again power was vested in her to select the new emperor and first,
in council with her father's eunuchs, she took the opportunity to banish
three of Michael's uncles, including John, who was sent to a monastery.
<b><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael
</a></b>did
not reign&nbsp; long enough to issue his own coinage, but, significantly,
two patterns for gold coins during <b><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael's</a></b>
reign seem to depict not
<a href="mikeiv.html"><b>Michael</b>,</a> but Christ
Antiphonetes (Zoe's favourite icon) and Zoe and her father <b><a href="connieVIII.html">Constantine
VIII</a></b>.<b><a href="#N_35_">[[35]]</a></b> After<b> <a href="mikev.html">Michael
V'</a></b><a href="mikev.html">s</a> accession, for the first few days she
was proclaimed before him, and he behaved like a junior colleague, though
this was not to last. When
<b><a href="mikev.html">Michael</a></b> became
jealous of her status and popularity, he refused her access both to the
council chamber and (worse) to the treasury, while she and her servants
were kept under supervision; he also recalled his favourite uncle, Constantine
the <i>nobilissimus</i>. According to Scylitzes, Constantine advised Michael
not to trust Zoe but to watch her in case she plotted against him as she
had against <b><a href="romanusiii.html">Romanus III</a></b> and <b><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael
IV</a></b>, and John (from exile) did the same by letter.<b><a href="#N_36_">[[36]]</a></b>
Five months after becoming emperor, <a href="mikeiv.html"><b>Michael</b>
</a>determined to exile her and, after consultation with his councillors
and astrologers, had her tonsured (made a nun) and dispatched her to a
monastery on the island of Principo (one of the Princes' islands) on the
night of 18/19 April 1042. His excuse was that she was trying to poison
him.<b><a href="#N_37_">[[37]]</a></b> Psellus has Zoe, while on board
ship, tearfully declaiming a speech in which she apostrophises her uncle
<b><a href="basilii.html">Basil</a></b> and highlights her own status as
his heir:
</p><p>'It was you, my uncle and emperor, you who wrapped me in my swaddling
clothes as soon as I was born, you who loved me, and honoured me too, more
than my sisters, because, as I have often heard them say who saw you, I
was like yourself. It was you who said, as you kissed me and held me in
your arms, "Good luck, my darling, and may you live many years, to be the
glory of our family and the most marvellous gift to our Empire!" It was
you, also, who so carefully brought me up and trained me, you who saw in
my hands a great future for this same Empire. But your hopes have been
brought to nothing, for I have been dishonoured... I beg you, watch over
me from Heaven and protect your niece.'<b><a href="#N_38_">[[38]]</a></b>
</p><p>The senate was convinced by <a href="mikeiv.html"><b>Michael's</b> </a>accusation
(which Psellus dismisses as a fabrication), but the city as a whole was
restive, and the imperial guard were particularly unhappy. Nevertheless,
it was the people who first took action out of concern both for Zoe's safety
and her imperial status,<b><a href="#N_39_">[[39]]</a></b> the catalyst
being <b><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael's</a></b> proclamation on 19 April,
read by the eparch (city prefect) Anastasius in the forum of Constantine,
stating that Zoe had been banished for treason and the patriarch Alexius
deposed.<b><a href="#N_40_">[[40]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times">Riot and deposition</span></b></p></center>

<p><span face="Times">A spontaneous riot erupted, with the cry 'we don't
want the cross-trampling Calaphates as our emperor, but our ancestress
and heir to empire, our mother Zoe.' During the three days of anarchy that
followed, which saw some 3,000 dead, even women and children joined in
the rioting in defence of the empress:</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">'</span>Where can she be,' they cried, 'she who alone
is noble of heart and alone is beautiful? Where can she be, she who alone
of all women is free, the mistress of all the imperial family, the rightful
heir to the empire, whose father was emperor, whose grandfather was monarch
before him - yes, and great-grandfather too? How was it this low-born fellow
dared to raise a hand against a woman of such lineage?'<b><a href="#N_41_">[[41]]</a></b>
</p><p>The mob attacked the houses of the emperor's family as well as the palace,<b><a href="#N_42_">[[42]]</a></b>
and <b><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael</a></b> decided to have Zoe recalled
to defuse the situation, though she agreed to stay a nun.<b><a href="#N_43_">[[43]]</a></b>
However when he displayed Zoe to the crowd in the hippodrome, tonsured
and dressed not in her imperial robes but in nun's dress, this made the
situation still more unstable, and some refused to recognise their resplendent
empress in this black-robed figure.<b><a href="#N_44_">[[44]]</a></b> At
this point some of <b><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael'</a>s</b> opponents
seem to have feared that Zoe would again knuckle under and allow him to
retain power. As they could not get to her in the Great Palace, the populace,
in conjunction with the senators and palace eunuchs, instead massed at
the convent of Petrion and made <b><a href="theodorap.html">Theodora</a></b>
their figure-head. She was at first reluctant to be involved, but once
dressed in suitably magnificent robes allowed herself to be taken on horseback
to St Sophia where both elite and people paid her homage. Early in the
morning of 21 April the two sisters were jointly proclaimed empress.<b><a href="#N_45_">[[45]]</a></b>
</p><p>The decisiveness which <b><a href="theodorap.html">Theodora</a></b> was
later to show as sole empress is apparent at this point. Having accepted
that it was her fate to become empress, she appointed her officials while
in St Sophia and ensured that
<a href="mikeiv.html"><b>Michael</b> </a>was
deposed.<b><a href="#N_46_">[[46]]</a></b> Afraid that Zoe would pardon
<b><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael</a>,</b>
and that in her jealousy of Theodora she would do anything to keep her
sister from power, <b><a href="theodorap.html">Theodora's</a></b> supporters
seized
<b><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael</a></b> and his uncle Constantine,
both of whom had taken shelter in the Studium monastery, and had them blinded,
to great popular acclaim.<b><a href="#N_47_">[[47]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times">The two sisters</span></b></p></center>

<p><span face="Times">T</span>he situation was unprecedented. The empire
now had two empresses, one of whom was in the Great Palace and the other
in St Sophia. The senate was unable to decide which was superior to the
other -- Zoe as the elder, or <b><a href="theodorap.html">Theodora</a></b>
as the agent of liberation from 'tyranny'. Psellus has Zoe making the first
move and offering to share the empire with her younger sister:
</p><p>The question of the government was thus resolved by agreement between
them. Next, Zoe brought <b><a href="theodorap.html">Theodora</a></b> to
live with herself, escorted by a procession of great magnificence, and
made her joint-ruler of the Empire. As for <b><a href="theodorap.html">Theodora</a></b>,
she lost none of her respect for her sister, nor did she encroach on her
prerogatives. On the contrary she allowed Zoe to take precedence and, although
both were empresses, <b><a href="theodorap.html">Theodora</a></b> held rank
inferior to the older woman.<b><a href="#N_48_">[[48]]</a></b>
</p><p>In Scylitzes' account Zoe was forced by the populace into co-rule with
<b><a href="theodorap.html">Theodora</a></b>,
and she did so unwillingly, while Zonaras has the senate persuading her.<b><a href="#N_49_">[[49]]</a></b>
They were acclaimed as <i>autocratores</i> ('emperors'),<b><a href="#N_50_">[[50]]</a></b>
and in the seven weeks that followed (21 April to 12 June) they issued
coinage and ruled jointly,<b><a href="#N_51_">[[51]]</a></b> though as
the junior empress, <b><a href="theodorap.html">Theodora</a></b> sat slightly
behind Zoe during their court audiences.<b><a href="#N_52_">[[52]]</a></b>
Psellus is critical of their approach to government, stating that 'they
tended to confuse the trifles of the women's quarters with pressing matters
of state', which implies (in view of <b><a href="theodorap.html">Theodora's</a></b>
practical grasp of administration in 1055-1056) that Zoe at this point
took the lead. Their measures included the removal of <b><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael
V's</a></b> relations from office, abolishing the sale of offices, creating
new senators, and making generous donations to the citizens. <b><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael's</a></b>
uncle Constantine was brought back from exile to confess that he had 5,300
lbs of gold hidden in a cistern in his house, and was then returned to
exile (<b><a href="theodorap.html">Theodora</a></b> was as noted for her
parsimony as Zoe was for her extravagance), while the workings of government
continued as usual.<b><a href="#N_53_">[[53]]</a></b> The sisters issued
their own coinage, on the reverse of which was depicted the crowned busts
of the empresses, wearing jewelled robes with deep collars and the traditional
crowns with triangular plaques, holding between them a <i>labarum </i>(standard).<b><a href="#N_54_">[[54]]</a></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">Psellus notes that, in the empresses' performance
of duties, their officials were primarily responsible for decisions, though
when necessary they gave orders 'in a soft voice', and used their own judgement
or their officials' advice in responding to queries. However, he sees both
as temperamentally unfit to govern. The court suddenly took on a dramatic
quality, with reality becoming image and officials acting as if on stage,
while under Zoe's guidance the treasury lavishly dispensed money, and 'any
trifles hidden away there were distributed by her with generous abandon'.
It may be in this that his criticism of their administration lies, for
Zoe was the sort of woman, he tells us, who could exhaust a sea teeming
with gold-dust in a single day, while army pay and expenditure was diverted
to those who pleased and flattered the empress.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_55_">[[55]]</a></span></b>
</p><p>The key-note of this regime seems to have been set by Zoe, and during
these seven weeks she clearly became tired of sharing power with <a href="theodorap.html"><b>Theodora</b>.</a>
Each of the empresses had her own supporters who disagreed as to precedence.
Moreover, the minutiae of government may not have been to Zoe's taste and
she took steps to redefine the position.<b><a href="#N_56_">[[56]]</a></b>
At approximately sixty-four she decided to remarry and give the empire
an emperor, being careful to choose someone she knew well from her own
court circle. Various possibilities were canvassed.<sup> </sup><b><a href="#N_57_">[[57]]</a></b>
Constantine Dalassenus (who had earlier been considered a possibility for
Zoe's first husband by <b><a href="connieviii.html">Constantine VIII</a></b>)
again appeared to be a suitable candidate, but when summoned to the palace
to see Zoe he blew his chances by his abrupt comments and decided views
on government, and for the second time failed to marry Zoe and become emperor.
Another possibility, the handsome Constantine Catepanus, whom Zoe might
have currently been having an affair with (she had certainly been rumoured
to have been close to him earlier in <b><a href="romanusiv.html">Romanus'</a></b>
lifetime) died suddenly -- some said poisoned by his jealous wife who refused
to lose him to the empress. As the possible candidates decreased, Zoe finally
lighted on the twice-married
<b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine Monomachus</a></b>
as the person to be honoured with her hand and empire.<b><a href="#N_58_">[[58]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times">The third marriage</span></b></p></center>

<p><span face="Times">Zoe and <b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine Monomachus</a></b>
knew each other well. They had indulged in clandestine meetings in the
lifetime of her first husband, and before the adoption of <b><a href="mikev.html">Michael
V</a></b> he had been considered a possible successor to <b><a href="mikev.html">Michael
IV</a></b> because of his intimacy with Zoe.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_59_">[[59]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Zoe spoke to her bodyguard and retinue, and then, with their concurrence,
informed the senate. Constantine, who was currently in exile on Mytilene,
having been sent there on suspicion of conspiracy by John the <i><span size="-1">O</span></i></span><i>rphanotrophus</i>,
was recalled to the capital -- a summons which initially gave him some
unease.<b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_60_">[[60]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine</a></b>, whom several people (including<b><a href="mikeiv.html">
Michael IV</a></b>) had seen as a potential emperor, had been accompanied,
during his seven years in exile on Mytilene, by his devoted mistress, Maria
Scleraina, his second wife's cousin,<b><a href="#N_61_">[[61]]</a></b>
who was to be prominent at court over the next few years.<b><a href="#N_62_">[[62]]</a></b>
The couple had not married because of the restraints of canon law which
prohibited both third marriages and marriage within their degree of relationship.
She was the great-grand-daughter of Bardas Sclerus, who in the reign of
<b><a href="basilii.html">Basil
II</a></b> had three times proclaimed himself emperor, and she had long
had political ambitions for <b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine</a></b>.
In fact she was hoping to see <b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine</a></b>
on the throne, 'no less than himself (says Psellus) she was sustained by
hopes of power; nothing else mattered if only in the future she might share
the throne with her husband. I say husband because at that time she was
convinced that their marriage would be legally sanctioned, and all her
desires fulfilled when Constantine, as emperor, overruled the laws [banning
third marriages].'<b><a href="#N_63_">[[63]]</a></b> Zoe's choice of Constantine
upset Scleraina's plans; not only would he be marrying Zoe, not herself,
but she feared Zoe's jealousy when she should discover the relationship.
However, no reprisals eventuated. As it was the third marriage for both
<b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine</a></b>
and Zoe, the patriarch did not perform the marriage ceremony himself, delegating
this to a priest called Stypes. The marriage was not technically illegal
for, though Zoe was in her 60s and thus well over the canonical age for
third marriages, she was childless, which was an extenuating factor, and
Alexius was prepared to allow the marriage and crown <b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine</a></b>
as Constantine IX Monomachus.
<b><a href="#N_64_">[[64]]</a></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">Whatever Scleraina's concerns, <b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine</a></b>
was a faithful lover. At his very first meeting with Zoe in the capital,
he was prepared to disclose his relationship with Scleraina, describing
her more as his wife and fellow-sufferer than as his mistress and requesting
that she be recalled from exile and given suitable status at court. Zoe
at the age of sixty-four philosophically consented. Scleraina on Mytilene
was surprised to receive two letters, under the escort of an imperial bodyguard,
one from <b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine</a></b>, written the day
after his marriage (the day on which he was crowned, 12 June, and hence
his first official communication) summoning her to the city, and one from
Zoe, promising her a friendly reception.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_65_">[[65]]</a></span></b>
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times">Dangerous liaisons</span></b></p></center>

<p>While Zoe was clearly prepared to be complaisant towards her husband's
mistress, <a href="connieix.html"><b>Constantine</b> </a>initially had Scleraina
move with an 'undistinguished' bodyguard into a relatively ordinary house
at Kynegion. Nearby, he began the construction of the magnificent complex
of St George of Mangana, so that he could visit Scleraina on the pretext
of overseeing the building works. On such visits, he would entertain Zoe's
supporters among his retinue with a magnificent feast, for which they themselves
were allowed to select the menu. As a result, he quite did away with any
indignation they might have felt on behalf of the empress, and ensured
that they were as willing for the visits to take place as himself. Soon
the affair was no longer a secret: <b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine</a></b>
lived openly with Scleraina.<b><a href="#N_66_">[[66]]</a></b> St George
at Mangana became a great foundation, with a palace, gardens, a monastery
and church of St George, a home for the elderly, a home for the poor, a
residence for foreigners, and a hospital, as well as the school of law,
with extensive real estate in the capital and provinces -- the surplus
income from which was granted to Scleraina.<b><a href="#N_67_">[[67]]</a></b>
On her arrival <b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine</a></b> had also sent
her enormous sums of money as gifts, and, according to Psellus, he 'wasted
the imperial treasures in satisfying her every whim'.<b><a href="#N_68_">[[68]]</a></b>
</p><p>Inevitably <b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine</a></b> wanted Scleraina
to move into the palace, and Zoe agreed not only to her living there, but
to her being publicly granted all the honours of an empress and member
of the imperial family. To protect her interests, an official document
was drawn up, witnessed by the senators, in which Zoe promised to treat
Scleraina as an equal:
</p><p><span face="Times">"A treaty of friendship was set out in a document
and an imperial pavilion built for the ceremony of ratification. In front
sat Zoe, <b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine</a></b>, and Scleraina,
while the Senate filed in to witness this extraordinary contract, blushing
and for the most part talking in undertones. Despite their embarrassment,
the senators still praised the agreement as if it were a document sent
down from heaven. They called it a 'loving-cup' and lavished on it all
the other flattering epithets that deceive and cajole frivolous and empty-headed
persons. The contract being signed and the oaths administered, she who
had hitherto been only a lover, was now introduced to the private apartments
of the palace, no longer called 'mistress', but 'My Lady' and 'Empress'
officially."</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_69_">[[69]]</a></span></b>
</p><p>The sisters granted Scleraina the title of <i>sebaste</i> (the Greek
translation of 'Augusta') and she took rank after Zoe and <b><a href="theodorap.html">Theodora</a></b>,
being called <i>despoina</i>, mistress or empress, like them and taking
her place behind them in official processions and ceremonies.<b><a href="#N_70_">[[70]]</a></b>
Psellus, however, admits that while <b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine</a></b>
discussed affairs of state with both Zoe and Scleraina he was influenced
more by the views of 'the junior empress'. In any case, Zoe had little
interest in imperial concerns, and preferred to leave government in <b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine's</a></b>
hands,<b><a href="#N_71_">[[71]]</a></b> so the fact that <b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine</a></b>
tended to rely more on Scleraina's advice would not have caused friction.<b><a href="#N_72_">[[72]]</a></b>
As far as their living quarters were concerned, Zoe's, <b>Theodora's</b>
and Scleraina's apartments all adjoined <b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine's</a></b>,
but Scleraina's were the more private, and Zoe never visited the emperor
without first sending to find out if he were alone.<b><a href="#N_73_">[[73]]</a></b>&nbsp;
Prior to his accession Scleraina appears to have borne&nbsp; to <b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine</a></b>
a daughter, who would also have been received at court and been acknowledged
as his illegitimate daughter; this princess apparently married Vsevolod
of Kiev after 1046 and gave birth to Vladimir II Monomachus in 1053.<b><a href="#N_74_">[[74]]</a></b>
</p><p>The civilised arrangement at court was suspect in the eyes of the citizenry.
On 9 March 1044, when <b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine</a></b> prepared
to mount at the Chalke gate of the palace for his ceremonial ride to the
shrine of the Holy Martyrs, a cry went up: 'we don't want Scleraina as
empress, nor for our mothers, the purple-born Zoe and Theodora, to be killed
for her sake'. Constantine would have been lynched, or deposed, but for
the prompt action of Zoe and
<a href="theodorap.html"><b>Theodora</b> </a>who
gestured their affection for him from the palace balcony.<b><a href="#N_75_">([75]]</a></b>
Outside in the city, Zoe and <b><a href="theodorap.html">Theodora</a></b>
were seen as the legitimate 'rulers' and shared the imperial dignity with
<b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine</a></b>.
When
<b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine</a></b>celebrated his triumph
over the rebel general George Maniaces in 1043, Zoe and <b><a href="theodorap.html">Theodora</a></b>
sat on either side of him, though it was not usual for empresses to be
present at triumphal ceremonies: their presence highlighted the fact that
they were the source of <b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine's</a></b>
imperial authority.<b><a href="#N_76_">[[76]]</a></b> Both empresses appear
with <b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine</a></b> in a highly ornate manuscript
of St John Chrysostom (Codex Sinait. gr. 364), where they stand on either
side of the emperor. The trio is titled 'the shining trinity of earthly
sovereigns'. Zoe is dressed in red and
<b><a href="theodorap.html">Theodora</a></b>
in blue, and Zoe has dark hair in two plaits. <b><a href="theodorap.html">Theodora's</a></b>
face is badly damaged, but her regalia match Zoe's, and both are described
as Augustae and porphyrogennetae, with Zoe also given the epithet 'most
pious'. Rays descend to the heads of Zoe and <b><a href="theodorap.html">Theodora</a></b>
from the hands of the Christ above the trio, while rays from his feet reach
<b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine</a></b>.<b><a href="#N_77_">[[77]]</a></b>
The threesome also appear on the 'Crown of Monomachus', which, on the front,
depicts the Pantokrator flanked by Modesty and Truth with <b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine
Monomachus</a></b> and Zoe and
<b><a href="theodorap.html">Theodora</a></b>underneath;
on the back King David is shown between Sophia (Wisdom) and Propheteia
(Prophecy); underneath them three dancing girls are depicted, suggesting
that the crown celebrated a festivity such as a wedding. <b><a href="#N_78_">[[78]]</a></b>
</p><p>Just as Scleraina had had political ambitions for
<b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine</a></b>,
she used her influence with him to promote the career of her brother, Romanus
Sclerus, and gain him high rank.<b><a href="#N_79_">[[79]]</a></b> Constantine
had made her extremely wealthy, and she was able to flatter Zoe and
<b><a href="theodorap.html">Theodora</a></b>
and other courtiers with expensive presents, so that her position was not
resented.<b><a href="#N_80_">[[80]]</a></b> Indeed, she seems to have been
well-liked at court (everyone flatters the emperor's favourite), and Psellus
stresses that she had a lovely voice, though she was not attractive, and
that she had a lively intelligence and had frequent conversations with
him about Greek mythology.<b><a href="#N_81_">[[81]]</a></b> Scleraina's
position was obviously a subject of great discussion and her future was
seen as Constantine's main concern: 'it is possible that the emperor intended
to fund an empire for her in the future - at least there was much talk
of it. How it was to be done I do not know, but he certainly cherished
ambitions in that direction'.<b><a href="#N_82_">[[82]]</a></b> Obviously
the court expected that Zoe would predecease Scleraina, and that in some
way Scleraina would become empress-consort (in fact if not in name), but
it was the younger partner who was to die c. 1045 from asthma and severe
chest pains. She was buried in the church of St George of Mangana, and
<b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine</a></b>
showed his devotion by choosing at his death to be buried beside her, not
by Zoe.<b><a href="#N_83_">[[83]]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="connieix.html">Constantine</a></b>
was overwhelmed with grief,<b><a href="#N_84_">[[84]]</a></b> and part
of the estate at Bessai which belonged to St George of Mangana was donated
by <b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine</a></b> to St Lazarus Galesiotes,
in return for prayers for the deceased Scleraina and himself.<b><a href="#N_85_">[[85]]</a></b>
Psellus wrote a lengthy composition in verse (446 lines) on Scleraina's
demise to console <b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine</a></b>, and advised
him to take comfort in his grief in the empresses Zoe and <a href="theodorap.html"><b>Theodora</b>.</a><b><a href="#N_86_">[[86]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times">Zoe's interests</span></b></p></center>

<p>While <a href="connieix.html"><b>Constantine IX</b> </a>was occupied
with Scleraina, Zoe had her own occupations and amusements which Psellus
describes at some length. She liked exercising imperial power, in that
she was both outstandingly generous and given to inflicting blinding on
those who committed even the slightest error. Indeed <b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine</a></b>
had on several occasions to countermand her orders, or courtiers would
have been blinded for no reason.<b><a href="#N_87_">[[87]]</a></b> She
also possessed a rather robust sense of humour and Psellus describes how
she and <b><a href="theodorap.hrm">Theodora</a></b> were entertained in
the women's quarter of the palace with buffoonery and crude jokes.<b><a href="#N_88_">[[88]]</a></b>
An especial key to her favour was praise of her family, particularly the
achievements of her uncle <b><a href="basilii.html">Basil II</a></b>. The
treasury emptied faster than revenues could come in. The right to empty
the treasury was in Zoe's view an integral part of the perquisites of the
heir to the empire and courtiers took advantage of this. Those who wished
to flatter her - and Psellus states that many did - would throw themselves
on the floor at her approach, as if struck by lightning at her appearance,
and she would reward them magnificently with 'chains of gold'; on the other
hand over-effusive thanks (if obviously insincere) would see the recipient
in chains of iron instead. But in general she lacked interest both in the
details of matters of state, and in the conventional womanly occupations
of spinning and weaving, and occupied herself with more mundane pursuits.
Her rooms in the palace were filled with boiling pots and pans, for the
manufacture of ointments and perfumes:
</p><p>"Her own private bedroom was no more impressive than the workshops in
the market where the artisans and the blacksmiths toil, for all round the
room were burning braziers, a host of them. Each of her servants had a
particular task to perform: one was allotted the duty of bottling the perfumes,
another of mixing them, while a third had some other task of the same kind.
In winter, of course, these operations were demonstrably of some benefit,
as the great heat from the fires served to warm the cold air, but in the
summer-time the others found the temperature near the braziers almost unbearable.
Zoe herself, however, surrounded by a whole bodyguard of these fires, was
apparently unaffected by the scorching heat. In fact, both she and her
sister seemed naturally perverse. They despised fresh air, fine houses,
meadows, gardens; the charm of all such things meant nothing to them."<b><a href="#N_89_">[[89]]</a></b>
</p><p>At least in old age, Zoe disdained cloth-of-gold, necklaces, diadems
and the ornate heavy robes which were normal for her rank, preferring instead
thin dresses, but she still enjoyed flattery of her appearance.<b><a href="#N_90_">[[90]]</a></b>
In her youth she had been extremely beautiful - plump, though not very
tall, with a perfect figure, large eyes and imposing eyebrows, golden hair
and a beautifully white complexion. Even as an old woman she made a commanding
figure, with her smooth skin, though her hands were unsteady and her back
bent.<b><a href="#N_91_">[[91]]</a></b> The famous portrait of Zoe on the
panel in the south gallery of St Sophia, in which she offers a legal document
to Christ, while
<b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine IX</a></b> offers
a donation of money (she was originally depicted with <b><a href="romanusiii.html">Romanus
III</a></b>), is evidence for her appearance, and for her perception of
it, in old age.<b><a href="#N_92_">[[92]]</a></b> It also acts as a statement
of Zoe's imperial status, as empress and legitimate heir of the empire.
</p><p><span face="Times">But her main concern in this manufacture of cosmetics
may not have been vanity but piety. In old age, she was particularly devoted
to an icon of Christ which she had commissioned. This was a copy of the
miracle-working icon of Christ 'Antiphonetes' which responded to questions
put to it by changing colour and which foretold coming events,</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_93_">[[93]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and her manufacture of ointments was primarily in order to make offerings
for this icon. This presumably reflected marginal magical and astrological
practices.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_94_">[[94]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Psellus reports that he often saw Zoe clasping the icon and talking to
it, or lying on the ground in front of it beating her breasts: 'if she
saw the image turn pale, she would go away crestfallen, but if it took
on a fiery red colour, its halo lustrous with a beautiful radiant light,
she would lose no time in telling the emperor and prophesying what the
future was to bring forth.'</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_95_">[[95]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
It appears then that these perfumes and ointments were offerings. Indeed,
Psellus later repeats that Zoe was not interested in normal female pursuits,
but in one thing alone: 'the offering of sacrifices to God. I am not referring
so much to the sacrifice of praise, or of thanksgiving, or of penitence,
but to the offering of spices and sweet herbs, the products of India and
Egypt.'</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_96_">[[96]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
So it seems that the manufacturing process in her apartments was for the
purposes of offerings to the Antiphonetes icon and for invoking its 'magical'
divinatory properties.</span>

<p><b><span face="Times">Zoe's death</span></b></p></center>

<p>Zoe died from a fever in 1050, aged approximately seventy-two. Prior
to her death she remitted debts and granted an amnesty to condemned criminals.
For the last time she squandered gold from the treasury 'like a river'.<b><a href="#N_97_">[[97]]</a></b>
She was buried in the church that she founded in honour of Christ Antiphonetes.<b><a href="#N_98_">[[98]]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="connieix.html">Constantine</a></b> (though he chose to be buried
next to Scleraina) shed tears at her tomb, and insisted that the growth
of a mushroom on her grave was a miracle showing that her soul was numbered
amongst the angels. Psellus is derisive of this but <b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine's</a></b>
belief was supported by many more sycophantic courtiers.<b><a href="#N_99_">[[99]]</a></b>
</p><p>Zoe had legitimated four emperors by marriage or adoption. Modern judgements
on her are somewhat harsh: 'Empress Zoe, though historically significant 
was politically a pathetic figure, more concerned with unguents, ointments
and the marriage bed than with the affairs of state.'<b><a href="#N_100_">[[100]]</a></b>
Yet, she certainly played a part in commissioning the death of her first
husband and may well have conspired to poison John the <i>Orphanotrophus</i>
and plotted against <b><a href="mikeiv.html">Michael IV</a> </b>and <b><a href="mikev.html">Michael
V</a></b>, though she took little interest in the details of administration
and government. She took after her acerbic father, <a href="connieviii.html"><b>Constantine
VIII</b>,</a> in more ways than one (choosing pleasure before politics),
yet throughout everything remained the darling of the populace, who saw
her as their beloved mother and mistress:
</p><p>'  she who alone is noble of heart and alone is beautiful, she who alone
of all women is free, the mistress of all the imperial family, the rightful
heir to the empire '<b><a href="#N_101_">[[101]]</a></b>
