<h3>
<b>Agrippina the Elder</b></h3></center>

<center>
<h4>
Donna Hurley</h4></center>
Vipsania Agrippina, always simply Agrippina or Agrippina the Elder, when
it is necessary to distinguish her from <b><a href="aggieii.html">Agrippina
the Younger</a></b>, was a daughter of <b><a href="agrippa.html">Marcus
Vipsanius Agrippa</a></b> and of<b><a href="julia.html"> Julia</a></b>,
the daughter and only child of the emperor <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>.
<b><a href="aggie.html">Marcus Agrippa</a></b> did not belong to one of
Rome's distinguished families but had been one of <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus'</a></b>
chief supporters in his rise to power and remained a trusted ally. In 21
BC <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b> rewarded him with marriage
to <b><a href="julia.html">Julia</a></b>, hoping for a direct line of descent
with <b><a href="agrippa.html">Agrippa</a></b> serving as regent, if necessary,
until any male children came of age. He and <b><a href="julia.html">Julia
</a></b>did not disappoint. They produced five children, but it was only
the family of their second daughter, Agrippina, who would play an important
role in the Julio-Claudian dynasty during the next century.
<p><b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b> lost little time in claiming
this family for himself. He quickly adopted the two oldest boys, Gaius,
who was born in 20 B.C., and Lucius, who was born in 17. A daughter, Julia,
was evidently born between the boys and Agrippina between 16 and 13. <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus'</a></b>
plan for succession seemed in order until <b><a href="agrippa.html">Agrippa</a></b>
died in 12 BC, and a second interim solution was necessary. It was provided
by another marriage for <b><a href="julia.html">Julia</a></b>, this time
to <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus'</a></b> stepson, the son of his wife
<b><a href="livia.html">Livia</a></b>, <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius
Claudius Nero</a></b>, who would follow him as the emperor <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius.
Tiberius</a></b> was to serve as guardian for the young boys until they
came of age. But plans miscarried again when the two died prematurely in
AD 4 and 2 respectively. <b><a href="#N_1_">[[1]]</a></b> A final arrangement
involved Agrippina. In AD 4 <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b> adopted
<b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b> and in doing so made him his
heir. To further assure the continuation of the dynasty that he had founded,
he had <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b> adopt his own brother's
son, the young <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b>, although
he already had a son of his own. <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
further arranged that <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b> marry
his granddaughter Agrippina. Their union brought <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b>
closer yet to the imperial house. <b><a href="#N_2_">[[2]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b>Wife of Germanicus</b></p></center>

<p>The marriage of Agrippina and <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b>
proved even more fertile than had that of <b><a href="julia.html">Julia</a></b>
and <b><a href="agrippa.html">Agrippa</a></b>. Of their nine children, two
died in infancy and another as a toddler, but six, three males and three
females, survived to maturity. These offspring promised a stable future
for the imperial house. Near the end of his life, <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
brought the two oldest, Nero and Drusus, into the royal box at games and
showed them off in order to advertise family continuity. They added to
the popularity of <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b> as well,
and Agrippina acquired a well-deserved reputation for successful childbearing.
<b><a href="#N_3_">[[3]]</a></b>
</p><p>In AD 12 <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus </a></b>left Rome to
assume command of the legions on the Rhine frontier. Agrippina joined him
in 14 and, so far as is known, remained in the north until 17. They had
with them their youngest son, two-year old <b><a href="gaius.html">Gaius</a></b>.
It was at this time that the little boy acquired his nickname <b><a href="gaius.html">Caligula</a></b>
("Little Boots") from the footwear worn by the legionaries. Agrippina paraded
him about dressed in a soldier's costume, another display of their children
for the benefit of the imperial house. But she began to be accused of bringing
attention to herself and to her husband at the expense of the present emperor.
<b><a href="#N_4_">[[4]]</a></b> When <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
died in the late summer of AD 14, Agrippina was in <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus'</a></b>
camp near the present city of Cologne. The legions, dissatisfied with terms
of their service, used the occasion to demand improved conditions. The
unrest forced her to evacuate to a safer area in the south of the frontier
region. In September of AD 15 she was once again in a forward position
as she rallied discouraged legions returning from a difficult German campaign.
She prevented the destruction of a temporary bridge across the Rhine and
by her action gained a reputation for prowess and fortitude. The first
two of her three daughters (<b><a href="aggieii.html">Agrippina the Younger</a></b>
and Drusilla) were born during this period, both probably in the territory
of the Treveri, near modern Koblenz. <b><a href="#N_5_">[[5]]</a></b> <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b>
was recalled to Rome after the end of the campaigning year of AD 16. Agrippina
returned with him, and their children, now numbering five, all took part
in their father's triumphal parade in May of AD 17. Once again the great
grandchildren of <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b> gave an effective
public face to the imperial house. <b><a href="#N_6_">[[6]]</a></b>
</p><p>Next, <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b> was given a special
command (<i>maius imperium</i>, "greater power"), to settle affairs in
Rome's eastern theater, Asia Minor today. Agrippina once more went with
him, again with <b><a href="gaius.html">"Little Boots"</a></b> in tow. Their
last child, a daughter, Julia Livia (Livilla), was born in early 18 on
the island of Lesbos on their way to his headquarters in Syria. In the
autumn of AD 19, <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b> died under
suspicious circumstances. Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso commanded the legions
in Syria; <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus'</a></b> authority overlapped
his. Predictable animosity followed, and Piso would be accused of poisoning
the young and popular prince. An additional layer of distrust was added
by the allegation that <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus'</a></b> wife <b><a href="livia.html">Livia</a></b>
incited Piso's wife, her friend Plancina, against Agrippina. But even without
<b><a href="livia.html">Livia's</a></b> prodding, Plancina was jealous of
Agrippina's superior status. <b><a href="#N_7_">[[7]]</a></b> When <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b>
died, Agrippina was said to have received his dying words: He urged her
to "lay aside her intractable temper" in order to avoid conflict with powers
in Rome who were stronger than she was, and he asked his circle of friends
to present the granddaughter of <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
and his six children to the Roman people. Whether or not <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b>
actually spoke these words on his deathbed, the narrative legitimately
anticipates the difficulties that would follow for Agrippina and their
children. She returned to Italy dramatically bearing her husband's ashes.
She was met first by an escort of praetorians and then, closer to Rome,
by family members. She received the attention due a hero's wife. <b><a href="#N_8_">[[8]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b>Hostility in the Court of Tiberius</b></p></center>

<p>Despite <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus' </a></b>warning, Agrippina
did become involved in court politics as an advocate for her own sons in
opposition to Drusus, the natural son of <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>.
While <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b> lived, he had a circle
of followers who anticipated the day when he would succeed <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>.
These men now transferred their attention to his oldest sons, Nero and
Drusus, who were in their early teens when their father died. Their mother
anchored the hopes of the boys and their supporters. There was talk of
a "party of Agrippina", although the label probably refers to a perception
of court politics rather than to an organized movement. The intrigues of
the ambitious praetorian prefect, Lucius Aelius Sejanus made the conflict
more lethal, but Agrippina's personality evidently contributed to the hostile
atmosphere. <b><a href="#N_9_">[[9]]</a></b> Her strength and steadfastness
could easily be read as ambition and arrogance. She possessed "insolent
speech and a stubborn spirit". She was "impatient of equality, eager to
be in charge and cast off the faults of women in exchange for the responsibilities
of men." <b><a href="#N_10_">[[10]]</a></b>
</p><p>Conflict between the widow and the emperor grew more serious. She was
attacked indirectly when her friends were attacked. At one point Agrippina
asked <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b> permission to remarry.
He refused to answer her, for he understood the implications of her request;
a fresh marriage would have allowed the granddaughter of <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
to introduce a protector for her sons. Besides, although she was no longer
very young, her known fertility might bring complications. Distrust escalated.
Sejanus stirred up trouble by telling her that <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>
wanted to poison her, and as a result Agrippina refused food from his hand;
<b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b> did not forgive the insult.
<b><a href="#N_11_">[[11]]</a></b> Finally, Agrippina and her oldest son
Nero were arrested, perhaps put under house detention as early as AD 27.
When they were exiled to the Pontian islands off the coast of Naples in
29, crowds protested in the streets. Agrippina's second son, Drusus, was
arrested in 30 and kept in Rome. Nero was forced to suicide in 31. Agrippina
remained intractable even as a prisoner; on one occasion her behavior earned
her a beating so severe that she lost an eye. She starved to death in 33,
either intentionally or because food was withheld. Drusus died of starvation
the same year. The day she died was declared a holiday. <b><a href="#N_12_">[[12]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p></center>

<p><b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b> and the granddaughter
of <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b> continued to provide political
capital for their children and grandchildren. Agrippina's last surviving
son, <b><a href="gaius.html">Gaius</a></b>, survived the purges of Sejanus
and<b> <a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b> to become emperor in 37.
One of his first acts upon accession was to retrieve the relics of his
mother Agrippina and his brother Nero from the islands where they had died
and to give them proper burial in the Mausoleum of <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>.
<b><a href="#N_13_">[[13]]</a></b> Her three daughters, <b><a href="aggieii.html">Agrippina,</a></b>
Drusilla, and Livilla, were players in the power struggles that took place
during the reigns of <b><a href="gaius.html">Gaius </a></b>and <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>.
The oldest of them, <b><a href="aggieii.html">Agrippina the Younger</a></b>,
became the wife of <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b> and then
the mother of the emperor <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b>.

</p><p><a name="N_2_"></a>[[2]] Germanicus was the son of Tiberius' deceased
brother Drusus. His name was Germanicus Julius Caesar after his adoption
by Tiberius. To achieve even greater redundancy for the succession, Augustus
adopted his last surviving grandson, Agrippa Postumus, at the same time.
Postumus was born in 12 BC after the death of his father Agrippa. He would
prove unsuitable to rule as time passed-- or so it was claimed -- and he
was killed at the opening of Tiberius' reign. Agrippina's older sister
Julia was already married to L. Aemilius Paulus. At the time of her marriage
(about 4 BC), the succession was assumed to be firmly in order, and so
she did not play a part in the plans as Agrippina would. Julia was exiled
in AD 8 and died in disgrace. Tac.<i> Ann. </i>1.3, 5-6, 33; 4.71. Suet.
