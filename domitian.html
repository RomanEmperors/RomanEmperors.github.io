<h3>Early Career</h3>



        <p>Domitian was born in Rome on 24 October A.D. 51, the youngest son

of <b><a href="vespasia.html">Vespasian</a></b>, Roman emperor (A.D. 69-79) and Domitilla I, a treasury

clerk's daughter.<b><a href="#1">[[1]]</a></b>  Despite a literary tradition that associated Domitian

with Flavian poverty, the family's status remained high throughout his

early years: <b><a href="vespasia.html">Vespasian</a></b> was appointed to the prestigious proconsulship of

North Africa in A.D. 59, and seven years later was granted a special

command in the East by the emperor <a href="nero.html"><b>Nero</b></a> (A.D. 54-69) to settle a revolt in

Judaea; <a href="titus.html"><b>Titus</b></a>, Domitian's older brother by at least ten years and

<b><a href="vespasia.html">Vespasian's</a></b> eventual successor as emperor, had married well in the 60's and

was chosen as a legionary legate under <b><a href="vespasia.html">Vespasian</a></b> in the East.<b><a href="#2">[[2]]</a></b></p>

      <p>  Unlike <a href="titus.html"><b>Titus</b></a>, Domitian was not educated at the emperor's court, yet

he received sound training in Rome in the same way as any member of the

senatorial elite of his day.  The imperial biographer Suetonius records

that  Domitian gave public recitals of his works, conversed elegantly, and

produced memorable comments; as emperor, he would write and publish a book

on baldness.<b><a href="#3">[[3]]</a></b>  Domitian's adolescence was also marked by isolation.  His

mother had long been dead, he was considerably younger than his brother,

and his father was away for much of his teenage years, first in Africa and

then in Judaea.<b><a href="#4">[[4]]</a></b>  An obvious outcome of all of this was his preference

for solitude, a trait that would  contribute significantly to his

difficulties with various constituents as emperor.<b><a href="#5">[[5]]</a></b></p>

      <p>  Little is known about Domitian in the turbulent 18 months of the

three emperors, but in the aftermath of the downfall of <a href="vitell.html"><b>Vitellius</b></a> in A.D.

69 he presented himself to the invading Flavian forces, was hailed as

Caesar, and moved into the imperial residence.<b><a href="#6">[[6]]</a></b> Guided by Gaius Licinius

Mucianus, <b><a href="vespasia.html">Vespasian's</a></b> chief advisor, Domitian represented the family in the

senate and suggested that other issues be postponed until <b><a href="vespasia.html">Vespasian's</a></b>

arrival from the East.  Eager for military glory himself, Domitian soon led

reinforcements to Germany, where the Batavian auxiliaries of the Rhine

legions had revolted.  The uprising failed before he could arrive, however,

and the literary accounts of his achievements are not to be trusted.<b><a href="#7">[[7]]</a></b>  It

was also during this period, perhaps in late A.D. 70, that he married

Domitia Longina, daughter of the highly regarded general, Gnaeus Domitius

Corbulo, whom <a href="nero.html"><b>Nero</b></a> had forced to commit suicide in A.D. 66.  For all

appearances, it was an excellent choice.  The name of Corbulo was

synonymous with military achievement, and the general had left behind a

substantial <i>clientela</i>.  Even so, the marriage was troubled.  An only child

died young, and Domitia was probably exiled by her husband c. A.D 83.

Later, she would be recalled to the palace, where she lived with Domitian

until his death.<b><a href="#8">[[8]]</a></b></p>

    <p>    Domitian's role in the 70's was determined largely by <b><a href="vespasia.html">Vespasian's</a></b>

choice of <a href="titus.html"><b>Titus</b></a> as his successor.  To him fell a series of ordinary

consulships, the tribunician power, the censorship, and the praetorian

prefecture.  Domitian, on the other hand, was named six times to the less

prestigious suffect consulship, retained the title of Caesar, and held

various priesthoods.  He was given responsibility, but no real power.

Nothing changed when <a href="titus.html"><b>Titus</b></a> acceded to the throne, as Domitian received

neither tribunician power nor <i>imperium </i>of any kind. The brothers were never

to become close, and as <a href="titus.html"><b>Titus</b></a> lay dying in September 81, Domitian hastened

to the praetorian camp, where he was hailed as emperor.  On news of <a href="titus.html"><b>Titus'</b></a>

death, the senate chose first to honor the dead emperor before elevating

his brother, an early indication perhaps of Domitian's future troubles with the

aristocracy.  At any rate, after waiting an extra day, Domitian received

<i>imperium</i>, the title Augustus, and tribunician power along with the office

of <i>pontifex maximus </i>and the title<i> pater patriae</i>, father of his country.<b><a href="#9">[[9]]</a></b>

        </p>

<h3>Administration</h3>



<p>        As emperor, Domitian was to become one of Rome's foremost

micromanagers, especially concerning the economy.  Shortly after taking

office, he raised the silver content of the denarius by about 12% (to the

earlier level of Augustus), only to devaluate it in A.D. 85, when the
imperial income must have proved insufficient to meet military and public

expenses.<b><a href="#10">[[10]]</a></b>  Confiscations and the rigorous collection of taxes soon

became necessary.  On another front, he sought to promote grain production

by calling for empire-wide limitations on viticulture, but the edict met

with immediate opposition and was never implemented.<b><a href="#11">[[11]]</a></b>  On the other

hand, there were notable successes.  The great fire of A.D. 64, the civil

wars of A.D 68-69, and another devastating fire in A.D. 80 had left Rome

badly in need of repair.  Domitian responded by erecting, restoring, or

completing some 50 structures, including the restored Temple of Jupiter on

the Capitol and a magnificent palace on the Palatine.  The building

program, ambitious and spectacular, was matched by hardly any other

emperor.<b><a href="#12">[[12]]</a></b> He was also able to maintain the debased currency standard of

A.D. 85, which was still higher than the Vespasianic one, until the end of

his reign. The economy, therefore, offered a ready outlet for Domitian's

autocratic tendencies.  There were failures, but he also left the treasury

with a surplus, perhaps the best proof of a financially sound administration.</p>

        <p>Domitian's reach extended well beyond the economy.  Late in A.D. 85

he made himself <i>censor perpetuus</i>, censor for life, with a general

supervision of conduct and morals.  The move was without precedent and,

although largely symbolic, it nevertheless revealed Domitian's obsessive

interest in all aspects of Roman life.  An ardent supporter of traditional

Roman religion, he also closely identified himself with Minerva and

Jupiter, publicly linking the latter divinity to his regime through the

<i>Ludi Capitolini</i>, the Capitoline Games, begun in A.D.86.  Held every four

years in the early summer, the Games consisted of chariot races, athletics

and gymnastics, and music, oratory and poetry.  Contestants came from many

nations, and no expense was spared; the emperor himself awarded the

prizes.<b><a href="#13">[[13]]</a></b>  In the same manner, Domitian offered frequent and elaborate

public shows, always with an emphasis on the innovative: gladiator contests

held at night; female combatants and dwarves; food showered down upon the

public from ropes stretched across the top of the Amphitheater.<b><a href="#14">[[14]]</a></b>  Thus

did the emperor seek to underscore not only Rome's importance but also his

own and that of the Flavian regime.</p>

        <p>Beyond Rome, Domitian taxed provincials rigorously and was not

afraid to impose his will on officials of every rank.  Consistent with his

concern for the details of administration, he also made essential changes

in the organization of several provinces and established the office of

curator to investigate financial mismanagement in the cities.  Other

evidence points to a concern with civic improvements of all kinds, from

road building in Asia Minor, Sardinia and near the Danube to building and

defensive improvements in North Africa.<b><a href="#15">[[15]]</a></b>  Less easy to gauge is

Domitian's attitude toward Christians and Jews, since reliable  evidence

for their persecution is difficult to find.  Christians may have been among

those banished or executed from time to time during the 90's, but the

testimony falls short of confirming any organized program of persecution

under Domitian's reign.  On the other hand, there is clear evidence that

Jews were made to feel uneasy under Domitian, who scrupulously collected

the Jewish tax and harassed Jewish tax dodgers during much of his rule.  As

with Christians, such policies did not amount to persecution, but it does

help to explain the Jewish fears of expulsion present in the sources.<b><a href="#16">[[16]]</a></b>

On balance, the tradition of Domitian as persecutor has been greatly

overstated, yet given his autocratic tendencies and devotion to Roman pagan

religion, it is easy to see how such stories could have evolved and

multiplied.</p>



<h3>Military Affairs</h3>



      <p>  While the military abilities of <b><a href="vespasia.html">Vespasian</a></b> and <a href="titus.html"><b>Titus</b></a> were genuine,

those of Domitian were not.  Partly as an attempt to remedy this

deficiency, Domitian frequently became involved in his own military

exploits outside of Rome.  He claimed a triumph in A.D. 83 for subduing the

Chatti in Gaul, but the conquest was illusory.  Final victory did not

really come until A.D. 89.  In Britain, similar propaganda masked the

withdrawal of Roman forces from the northern borders to positions farther

south, a clear sign of Domitian's rejection of expansionist warfare in the

province.<b><a href="#17">[[17]]</a></b>  The greatest threat, however, remained on the Danube.  The

emperor visited Moesia in A.D. 85 after Oppius Sabinus, the Moesian

governor, had been killed by invading Dacians.  In the First Dacian War,

initial success against the aggressors by Domitian's praetorian prefect,

Cornelius Fuscus, allowed the emperor to celebrate his second triumph at

Rome in A.D. 86. Fuscus was subsequently killed trying to avenge Sabinus'

death, however, and Domitian soon returned to the Danube, where Roman

forces, under the newly appointed governor of Upper Moesia, Tettius

Julianus, defeated the Dacians at Tapae in the Second Dacian War, most

likely in A.D. 88.  Matters remained far from settled.  <a name="Note_X"></a>In January, A.D.

89, the governor of Upper Germany, L. Antonius Saturninus, mutinied at

Mainz.  The revolt was promptly suppressed and the rebel leaders brutally

punished.  Later that same year, Domitian attacked the Suebian Marcomanni

and Quadi in the First Pannonian War, while offering the Dacian king

Decebalus a settlement to avoid conflicts on two fronts.  Compelled to

return to the Danube three years later, Domitian fought the combined forces

of the Suebi and the Sarmatians in the Second Pannonian War.  Few other

details are available beyond the fact that a Roman legion was destroyed in

a campaign that lasted about eight months.  By January, A.D. 93, Domitian

was back in Rome, not to accept a full triumph but the lesser <i>ovatio</i>, a

sign perhaps of unfinished business along the Danube.  In fact, during the

final years of Domitian's reign, the buildup of forces on the middle Danube

and the appointment and transfer of key senior officials suggest that a

third Pannonian campaign directed against the Suebi and Sarmatians may have

been underway.  Even so, there is no testimony of actual conflicts and the

evidence does not extend beyond A.D. 97.<b><a href="#18">[[18]]</a></b></p>





<h3>The Emperor's Court and His Relationship with the Aristocracy</h3>





     <p>   Domitian's autocratic tendencies meant that the real seat of power

during his reign resided with his court.  The features typically associated

with later courts - a small band of favored courtiers, a keen interest in

the bizarre and the unusual (<i>e.g.</i>, wrestlers, jesters, and dwarves), and a

highly mannered, if somewhat artificial atmosphere, characterized

Domitian's palace too, whether at Rome or at his Alban villa, some 20

kilometers outside of the capital.<b><a href="#19">[[19]]</a></b>  Courtiers included family members

and freedmen, as well as friends (<i>amici</i>), a group of politicians, generals,

and praetorian prefects who offered input on important matters.<b><a href="#20">[[20]]</a></b>

Reliance upon <i>amici</i> was not new, yet the arrangement underscored Domitian's

mistrust of the aristocracy, most notably the senate, whose role suffered

as Domitian deliberately concentrated power in the hands of few senators

while expanding the duties of the equestrian class.  Senatorial grievances

were not without basis: at least 11 senators of consular rank were executed

and many others exiled, ample attestation of the emperor's contempt for the

body and its membership.<b><a href="#22">[[21]]</a></b>  The senate's enthusiastic support for the

damning of Domitian's memory, therefore, came as no surprise.

Nevertheless, the situation must be placed in its proper context.  By

comparison, the emperor <a href="claudius.html"><b>Claudius</b></a>(A.D. 41-54) executed 35 senators and

upwards of 300 equestrians, yet he was still deified by the senate!<b><a href="#22">[[22]]</a></b>

Domitian's mistake was that he made no attempt to mask his feelings about

the senate.  Inclined neither by nature nor by conviction to include the

body in his emperorship, he treated the group no differently than any

other.  Revenge would come in the form of an aristocratically based

literary tradition that would miss no opportunity to vilify thoroughly both

emperor and his rule.

</p>

<h3>Death and Assessment</h3>



        <p>On 18 September, A.D. 96, Domitian was assassinated and was

succeeded on the very same day by <a href="nerva.html"><b>M. Cocceius Nerva</b></a>, a senator and one of

his <i>amici</i>.  The sources are unanimous in stressing that this was a palace

plot, yet it is difficult to determine the level of culpability among the

various potential conspirators.<b><a href="#23">[[23]]</a></b></p>

       <p> In many ways, Domitian is still  a mystery - a lazy and licentious

ruler by some accounts, an ambitious administrator and keeper of

traditional Roman religion by others.<b><a href="#24">[[24]]</a></b>  As many of his economic,

provincial, and military policies reveal, he was efficient and practical in

much that he undertook, yet he also did nothing to hide the harsher

despotic realities of his rule.  This fact, combined with his solitary

personality and frequent absences from Rome, guaranteed a harsh portrayal

of his rule.  The ultimate truths of his reign remain difficult to know.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p><a name="1"></a>[[1]] Ancient sources: Tac. <i>Agr.</i>; Cass. Dio 67; Plin. <i>Pan</i>.; Statius,<i> Silv</i>.;

McCrum, M. and Woodhead, A.G. <i>Select Documents of the Principates of the

<p><a name="2"></a>[[2]] Compare, however, Suetonius' claim at Dom.1: "He is said to have spent

a poverty-stricken and rather degraded youth: without even any silver on

the table."  The passage is typical of the hostility directed toward

Domitian in the literary sources.</p>



<p><a name="3"></a>[[3]] Suet. <i>Dom.</i> 18, 20; in praise of his literary talents, see also: Plin.

<i>NH Praef</i> 5; Statius, <i>Achil.</i> 1.15; Silius Italicus, <i>Pun</i>.3.621.  But there

were just as many hostile accounts of his literary prowess: Tac. <i>Hist.</i>

4.86; Suet. <i>Dom</i>. 2.2. Since none of this evidence survives, there is no way

to judge the validity of these conflicting assessments.  That the

controversy even exists, however, helps to confirm that Domitian was well

educated.</p>



<p><a name="4"></a>[[4]] Domitian was likely left in the care of his uncle, Sabinus II.  See

Tac. <i>Hist.</i> 3.75.  Whether he resided in Rome with his uncle during this

period is less clear.</p>



<p><a name="5"></a>[[5]] Domitian's preference for solitude finds particularly cruel expression

in Suetonius, who portrays him as spending hours alone every day catching

flies and stabbing them with a needle-sharp pen while emperor. See <i>Dom.</i>3.

Dio (66.9.5) also cites Domitian's predilection for his own company.</p>



<p><a name="6"></a>[[6]] Tac. <i>Hist</i>. 4.86; 4.2.</p>



<p><a name="7"></a>[[7]] Poetic embellishment of Domitian's military achievements: Statius,

<i>Theb.</i> 1.21; Martial, 9.101.13; 9.10.15-16; Jos. BJ 7.85; Silius Italicus,

<i>Pun.</i>3.608.</p>



<p><a name="8"></a>[[8]] Long after Domitian's memory had been damned, Domitia still referred to

herself as the emperor's wife, perhaps an indication that she maintained at

least some degree of affection for her husband.  The evidence is preserved

on brick stamps datable to A.D. 123; <i> CIL</i> 15.548a-9d.</p>

<p><a name="13"></a>[[13]] Capitoline Games: Censorinus, <i>De Die Natali</i> 18.5.  In A.D. 93,

Domitian also established the <i>Ludi Saeculare</i>s (Secular Games), a

celebration under the supervision of the <i>quindecimviri sacris faciundis</i>, an

aristocratic priestly college.  See Suet. <i>Dom</i>. 4.3; Stat. <i>Silv. </i>1.4.17;

4.1.37; Martial, 4.1.7; 10.63.3.</p>

<p><a name="16"></a>[[16]] For a careful and balanced treatment of difficult evidence: Jones, <i>The

Emperor Domitian</i>, 114-119.</p>



<p><a name="17"></a>[[17]] That the Chatti were not subdued in A.D. 83 is revealed by their role

in Saturninus' revolt (Suet. <i>Dom</i>. 6.2) and by their interference with the

Cherusci (Dio 67.5.1).  On the Roman withdrawal to the south in Britain,

see Hobley, A.S. "The Numismatic Evidence for the Post-Agricolan

Abandonment of the Roman Frontier in Northern Scotland,"<i> Britannia</i> 20

(1989): 69-74.  Numismatic evidence (<i>ibid.</i>, 73) indicates that the arch at

Richborough was erected at this same time.  It is difficult to resist the

conclusion that the monument served to mask the Roman retreat.</p>



<p><a name="18"></a>[[18]] The presence of five Roman legions in Pannonia, for example, is

unusual and points to genuine Roman concern with the region.  See Dusanic,

S. and Vasic, M. R. "An Upper Moesian Diploma of AD 96," <i>Chiron </i>7 (1977):

291-304; Jones, <i>The Emperor Domitian</i>, 153-155.</p>



<p><a name="19"></a>[[19]] Domitian did not hesitate to conduct a variety of imperial duties

outside of the <i>domus Flavia</i> in Rome.  For some of his activities at Alba:

Plin. <i>Ep</i>. 4.11.6; Suet. <i>Dom</i> 4.4; Dio 67.1.2; Juv. 4.99.  Tacitus (<i>Agr</i>. 45)

and Juvenal (4.145) refer to it as the <i>arx Albana</i>, "the Alban fortress,"

implying the residence of a despot.</p>
