<h3><b>Caracalla (211-217 A.D.)</b></h3>

<p><a href="caracala.jpg"></a></p>







The elder of the two sons of the emperor <a href="sepsev.html"><b>Septimius Severus</b></a>, Caracalla is



best-known for arranging the murder of his brother <a href="geta.html"><b>Geta</b></a> after the two



engaged in a power struggle in the months after their father's death. The



murder offended contemporaries and colored the following five years of



Caracalla's reign, a reign that ended on a Syrian road with the emperor's



own murder.<p>



Caracalla was born 4 April 188 in Lyon, where his father was serving as



governor of the province of Gallia Lugdunensis under the emperor <a href="commod.html"><b>Commodus</b></a>.



The child's name originally seems to have been Lucius Septimius Bassianus,



the <i>cognomen</i> commemorating the family of the boy's Syrian mother, Julia



Domna. When he was seven years old, his name was changed to Marcus



Aurelius Antoninus. The name change was a way of connecting the family of



Severus to that of the Antonines. Caracalla was a nickname taken from the



name of a type of cloak popularized by the emperor, but this nickname,



originally derisive, was never used officially.</p><p>



From the time of his name change to Antoninus, Caracalla was the



designated heir of <a href="sepsev.html"><b>Severus</b></a>. Less than three years later he was proclaimed



emperor, officially joining his father as co-rulers of the empire. At the



age of 14 he was married to the daughter of the praetorian prefect



Plautianus, but the teenager despised his wife. The marriage ended less



than three years later after the execution of Plautianus for treason, and



there were no children.</p><p>



Squabbling and rivalry developed between Caracalla and <a href="geta.html"><b>Geta</b></a>, who was only



11 months younger than his brother. <a href="sepsev.html"><b>Severus</b></a> felt the lack of



responsibilities in Rome contributed to the ill-will between his sons and



decided that the family would travel to Britain to oversee military



operations there. Caracalla was involved in directing the army's



campaigns, while<a href="geta.html"><b> Geta</b></a> was given civilian authority and a promotion to



joint emperor with his father and brother. Within two years of the



imperial family's arrival in Britain, <a href="sepsev.html"><b>Severus'</b></a> health began to



deteriorate, but his sons' relationship showed no signs of improvement.



<a href="sepsev.html"><b>Severus</b></a> died 4 February 211. Caracalla was 22 years old, <a href="geta.html"><b>Geta</b></a> 21.</p><p>



The brothers returned to Rome as joint emperors,but they eyed each other



with suspicion and failed to cooperate on government appointments and



policy decisions. Caracalla was being advised to have <a href="geta.html"><b>Geta</b></a> murdered, and



after at least one unsuccessful attempt, <a href="geta.html"><b>Geta</b></a> was killed in late December



211. The murder led to a wholesale slaughter of <a href="geta.html"><b>Geta's</b></a> supporters and



sympathizers, and soldiers were allowed to wreak havoc on the residents of



Rome. The looting and bloodshed lasted for at least two weeks, and one



contemporary source claims 20,000 people were killed.</p><p>



The year 212 saw a flurry of administrative reforms under the young



emperor's leadership. Soldiers received increases in pay and in legal



rights, but the most noteworthy change was the bestowal of Roman



citizenship upon all free residents of the empire. This grant of universal



citizenship, called by scholars the <i>Constitutio Antoniniana,</i>



allowed for greater standardization in the increasingly bureaucratic Roman



state.  Construction was also well underway on the magnificant baths in Rome that would bear the emperor's name. The main building seems to have been completed four years later, but the entire complex was not finished until the reign of <a href="alexsev.html"><b>Alexander Severus</b></a>.</p><p>



Caracalla spent little time in Rome after the spring of 213. A visit to



Gaul and a military campaign along the borders of Upper Germany and Raetia



occupied much of the rest of the year. Winter may have been spent in Rome,



but the following year Caracalla made a journey to the East in preparation



for a war against the Parthians. Along the way, the emperor displayed an



increasing fascination and identification with Alexander the Great. Like



the Macedonian prince, however, Caracalla would not survive an expedition



to the East. Only his ashes would return to Rome.</p><p>



Civil war in the Parthian realm between brothers and rival kings



Vologaeses VI and Artabanus V brought instability to the entire region,



and Caracalla wished to take advantage of that instability to increase



Roman control. Osroene was annexed in 213, but an attempt in the same year



to take over Armenia backfired. Caracalla's campaigns in the East seemed



designed to harass the Parthians more than anything else. In 215,



Caracalla suspended plans to invade Parthia after Vologaeses handed over



two political refugees, although Roman troops were sent into Armenia. The



following year the emperor led his troops into Mesopotamia after being



rebuffed in his request to marry the daughter of Artabanus. Roman armies



were generally unopposed in their forays, the Parthian forces having



retreated farther east. The Romans returned back across the Euphrates,



wintering in Edessa.</p><p>



Between campaigning seasons, Caracalla made a notorious visit to



Alexandria in the fall and winter of 215-16. Rioting accompanied the



imperial visit, and retribution was swift. The governor of Egypt was



executed as were thousands of the city's young men. Alexandria was



cordoned off into zones to prevent the free movement of residents, and



games and privileges were revoked.</p><p>



The emperor visited Alexandria for intellectual and religious reasons,



staying at the Serapeum and being present at the temple's sacrifices and



cultural events. Earlier, during the German war, the emperor visited the



shrine of the Celtic healing-god Grannus. Caracalla also visited the



famous temple of Asclepius in Pergamum and fully participated in its



program, which involved sleeping inside the temple compound and having his



dreams interpreted.</p><p>



It was this religious devotion that led to Caracalla's murder in 217.



Although suspicious of the praetorian prefect <a href="macrinus.html"><b>Macrinus</b></a>, Caracalla allowed



himself to be accompanied by only a small, select corps of bodyguards on



an early spring trip from the camp at Edessa to the temple of the moon-god



at Carrhae, about 25 miles away. During the journey back on 8 April 217,



Caracalla was killed. The returning guards claimed the emperor was



ambushed while defecating, and that the alleged assassin was one of their



own, a soldier named Martialis. Martialis was himself killed by the



avenging guards, or so the story went. Suspicion was strong that <a href="macrinus.html"><b>Macrinus</b></a>



arranged the entire affair.</p><p>



Caracalla's violent end seemed appropriate for an emperor who, early in



his reign, had his own brother killed. Yet the moralizing about fratricide



by both ancient and modern historians obscures the energetic, reformist



and even intellectual character of Caracalla's reign. Some of the reforms,



especially the pay raise for soldiers, would prove burdensome for future



emperors, but the changes brought about in the little more than five years



of Caracalla's sole rule would have long-lasting implications throughout



the empire for generations to come.</p><p>
