<p>Gratian (full name Flavius Gratianus) was born April 18, 359 at Sirmium.<a href="#1"><b>[[1]]</b></a> 

He was the son of the emperor <a href="vali.html"><b>Valentinian I</b></a>

 and Marina Severa.   His grandfather

was the <i>comes</i> Gratian.<a href="#2"><b>[[2]]</b></a>   Little is known of his early childhood, but he was

awarded the consulate of 366 along with Flavius Dagalaifus.<a href="#3"><b>[[3]]</b></a>   In 367, he

accompanied his father on campaign against the Alamanni in Gaul, where <a href="vali.html"><b>Valentinian</b></a>

was stricken with a mysterious illness.  When it appeared that the emperor would

die, a scramble immediately ensued to pick his successor.<a href="#4"><b>[[4]]</b></a>   The imperial court

championed the <i>magister memoriae</i> Rusticus Julianus, while the army supported the

<i>magister equitum</i> Severus.<a href="#5"><b>[[5]]</b></a>   <a href="vali.html"><b>Valentinian</b></a>, however, recovered and designated

Gratian as his successor by proclaiming him co-Augustus, a procedure which was

highly unusual.<a href="#6"><b>[[6]]</b></a>  </p> 

<p>By performing this act, it seems that <a href="vali.html"><b>Valentinian</b></a> hoped to

prevent a future recurrence of the infighting between the imperial court and the senior

officer corps over his successor, thus ensuring a smooth transfer of power upon his

death, and keeping the imperial office within his family. There was some concern

about the choice of Gratian, however, both among the army and by <a href="vali.html"><b>Valentinian</b></a>

himself.  Unlike his father and uncle 

<a href="valens.html"><b>Valens</b></a>, the young Gratian (he was only eight at the time)

did not show any proclivity for being a skilled soldier, being more interested in

 <i>humanitate et studiis disciplinarum</i>  than the art of war.<a href="#7"><b>[[7]]</b></a>    According to the

historian Ammianus Marcellinus, <a href="vali.html"><b>Valentinian</b></a>

 gave two speeches to assuage these

fears.  The first was delivered to the army.  He agreed that Gratian was not yet able

to  endure the dust of Mars,  but stated Gratian s ability to rule would be based on

his sense of justice and the nobility of his character.  Furthermore, he was sure that in

time Gratian would grow into the role of military commander.<a href="#8"><b>[[8]]</b></a>     After this speech,

<a href="vali.html"><b>Valentinian</b></a> then publicly admonished his son to  ponder the urgent matters  before

him and act accordingly.<a href="#9"><b>[[9]]</b></a>  </p> 

<p>Soon afterwards, <a href="vali.html"><b>Valentinian</b></a> turned his son s education over to Ausonius, the

leading rhetorician of the time.<a href="#10"><b>[[10]]</b></a>     <a href="vali.html"><b>Valentinian</b></a> brought Gratian with him during the

campaigning season of 368, but after it became clear that Gratian was not up to the

rigors of military life, <a href="vali.html"><b>Valentinian</b></a> 

kept him behind the front lines.<a href="#11"><b>[[11]]</b></a>      Ausonius

was apparently with Gratian during this time, as their experiences were the basis for

his poem <i>Bissula </i>and two epigrams about the Danube River.<a href="#12"><b>[[12]]</b></a>     Gratian was

named consul for the second time in 371 along with Petronius Probus, and again in

374, when his partner was Flavius Equitius.<a href="#13"><b>[[13]]</b></a>     This third consulate apparently

carried over to 375, as military operations in Pannonia precluded any nomination of

consuls for that year.<a href="#14"><b>[[14]]</b></a>    In 374 he married the daughter of the late emperor

<a href="constaii.html"><b>Constantius II</b></a>,

 <a href="eusebia.html"><b>Constantia</b></a>,

 who was very nearly captured by the Quadi in Pannonia

while on her way to marry Gratian.<a href="#15"><b>[[15]]</b></a>     After her death in 383 he married Laeta, a

woman otherwise unmentioned by the sources.<a href="#16"><b>[[16]]</b></a>   </p>

   <p>In November 375 <a href="vali.html"><b>Valentinian</b></a> died at Brigetio, leaving Gratian as senior Augustus

in the west. <a href="vali.html"><b>Valentinian s</b></a>

 wish for a smooth succession, however, was not realized. 

Before going to Illyricum to confront the Quadi and Sarmatians who were raiding

Pannonia, <a href="vali.html"><b>Valentinian</b></a>

 had arranged for Gratian to stay behind at Trier.<a href="#17"><b>[[17]]</b></a> 

Merobaudes, one of <a href="vali.html"><b>Valentinian s</b></a> leading generals (probably <i>magister peditum</i>),

arranged to have <a href="vali.html"><b>Valentinian s</b></a>

 youngest son, <a href="valenii.html"><b>Valentinian II</b></a>, proclaimed emperor,

ostensibly to quell a threatened rebellion by the army, who supposedly wanted to

install their own unnamed candidate.  Ammianus gives the excuse that <a href="valenii.html"><b>Valentinian II</b></a>

was closer to Brigetio than was Gratian.<a href="#18"><b>[[18]]</b></a> </p>

 <p>The reality may have been that

<a href="vali.html"><b>Valentinian I s</b></a>

 fear was realized:  Gratian, at about 16 years of age, was no warrior, and was thus not an

acceptable imperial candidate to the soldiers.  In contrast, the young <a href="valenii.html"><b>Valentianian</b></a>,

being only four years of age at the time of his father s death, could be vested with the

imperial title, allowing the generals a continued free rein.  According to Socrates,

Gratian was upset that he was not consulted, but he acquiesced to the army s

demands.<a href="#19"><b>[[19]]</b></a>   Ammianus, on the other hand, stated that many feared Gratian

would be angry, but he surprised everyone by accepting <a href="valenii.html"><b>Valentinian II s</b></a> elevation in

a graceful manner, even seeing to his half-brother s education.<a href="#20"><b>[[20]]</b></a>   Gratian

controlled Gaul, Britain, and Spain, while the court of <a href="valenii.html"><b>Valentinian II</b></a>

 controlled

Illyricum, Africa, and Italy.<a href="#21"><b>[[21]]</b></a> </p>

    <p>The incessant raids by the Alamanni appear to have ceased for the first few years

of Gratian s reign as senior Augustus in the west, possibly due to <a href="vali.html"><b>Valentinian I s</b></a>

earlier campaigns.  In 376, the emperor <a href="valens.html"><b>Valens</b></a>

 requested Gratian s help in defeating

the Goths, who were in revolt in Thrace.    Gratian sent the <i>dux</i> Frigeridus with some

legions from Pannonia and his <i>comes domesticorum</i> Richomeres with some Gallic

legions, but Merobaudes disobeyed and left some legions to guard the borders

against the Alamanni, should they decide to attack in the absence of troops.<a href="#22"><b>[[22]]</b></a>   

This last was yet another indication that Gratian was not held in high esteem by his

generals.  Furthermore, in 381 he moved his capital from Trier to Milan, and

according to Ammianus was more concerned with participating in Commodian

displays of personal prowess in the arena than with overseeing military affairs.<a href="#23"><b>[[23]]</b></a> </p>

<p>The situation in the east, however, grew so serious that it demanded Gratian s

presence.  He left for the east in late 377 but was delayed by a renewed Alamannic

invasion in February of 378, precipitated when a barbarian from his court leaked

word of the pending withdrawal of Roman troops from Gaul.  Ammianus credits

Merobaudes' prior decision to leave troops behind with preventing a disaster, and

Gratian s army won a huge victory at Argentia, killing 30,000 Alamanni.<a href="#24"><b>[[24]]</b></a>    With

the western provinces temporarily secured, he set out for the east again, but before

he could arrive, <a href="valens.html"><b>Valens</b></a>

 made the decision to attack the Goths at Adrianople, not

wanting to share a possible victory with Gratian.   This battle, which occurred on

August 9, 378, was a disaster, with <a href="valens.html"><b>Valens</b></a>

 and most of the eastern army

killed.<a href="#25"><b>[[25]]</b></a> 

</p>

 <p>Gratian, not being the military leader that his uncle or father had been,

found himself in dire straits as the Goths ravaged Thrace unopposed.  In response to

the crisis, Gratian recalled the younger <a href="theo1.html"><b>Theodosius</b></a> 

from Spain to take command of

the eastern armies.  After <a href="theo1.html"><b>Theodosius</b></a>

 had some initial successes, Gratian proclaimed

him as Augustus on January 19, 379 and returned west.  There is the very real

possibility that <a href="theo1.html"><b>Theodosius </b></a> recall and promotion was actually the work of influential

generals such as Saturninus, Victor, and Richomeres.<a href="#26"><b>[[26]]</b></a></p>

 <p> Due to the influence of Ausonius, members of the Gallic aristocracy dominated

Gratian s court.<a href="#27"><b>[[27]]</b></a>   Gratian was so enamored of Ausonius and his friends that he

promulgated a law that established a system for installing professional rhetoricians

and grammarians as teachers in the major cities of the diocese of Gaul.<a href="#28"><b>[[28]]</b></a>   The

predominant themes of the remaining years of Gratian s reign, however, was the

growing conflict between the emperor and provincial bishops, and between emperor

and the pagan senatorial aristocracy.  The first of these conflicts occured during

 the early 370 s when Priscillian, a Spanish noble,

began to preach an ascetical form of Christianity in southern Gaul.  He gained a

sizable following, including several influential bishops.  Hyginus, the bishop of

Cordoba, and the priest Ithacius felt their authority threatened by this new sect and

attempted to have Priscillian and his followers condemned as heretics.  This conflict

carried all the way to the imperial court, where Gratian sided with Ithacius and his

followers.  The bishops, however, bypassed Gratian and bribed Gratian s <i>magister

officiorum</i> Macedonius to issue a rescript cancelling the emperor s previous order. 

The issue of Priscillian s place in the Church would not be ultimately settled,

however, until Priscillian and several of his followers were executed by 

<a href="madmax.html"><b>Magnus

Maximus</b></a> sometime between 384 and 386.<a href="#29"><b>[[29]]</b></a>   Gratian s  support of Nicaean

orthodoxy may have also contributed to strained relations with 

<a href="valens.html"><b>Valens</b></a>, who was an

Arian.<a href="#30"><b>[[30]]</b></a>   In 379, Gratian recalled all of the bishops who had been expelled in the

east by <a href="valens.html"><b>Valens</b></a>.<a href="#31"><b>[[31]]</b></a></p>

<p>Gratian s orthodoxy can also be seen in his dealings with the senatorial aristocracy in

Rome.  In 382, at the urging of Ambrose, he removed the Altar of Victory from the

Forum and withdrew the state subsidies that funded many pagan activities.  This was

a crucial blow to one of the last major groups which supported Rome s pagan heritage. 

When the Senate protested, Gratian rejected the honorary title of <i>pontifex maximus</i>

and the ceremonial robes that went with this office.<a href="#32"><b>[[32]]</b></a>   The historian Zosimus, a

pagan himself, reported that this last incident prompted a senator to prophesy that

there would be a new <i>pontifex maximus</i> 

(i.e. <a href="madmax.html"><b>Magnus Maximus</b></a>) soon enough.<a href="#33"><b>[[33]]</b></a>

</p>

 <p>Whether or not this story was true, Gratian s career was shortly ended by the

usurper <a href="madmax.html"><b>Magnus Maximus</b></a>.  In early 383 Gratian went north to fight another incursion

of the Alamanni, which may have been instigated by <a href="madmax.html"><b>Maximus</b></a>.

  While Gratian was worn

down by this battle, <a href="madmax.html"><b>Maximus</b></a> was acclaimed by his troops in Britain, where he was

<i>comes Britanniae</i>, and crossed into Gaul to challenge Gratian.<a href="#34"><b>[[34]]</b></a>

    After a short

period of skirmishing, Gratian s Moorish cavalry, followed by most of his other

troops, went over to <a href="madmax.html"><b>Maximus</b></a>.  He fled towards the Alps, but was pursued and

killed at Lyons by Andragathius, <a href="madmax.html"><b>Maximus </b></a>

 <i>magister equitum</i>.<a href="#35"><b>[[35]]</b></a>

   The date of

his death was August 25, 383.<a href="#36"><b>[[36]]</b></a>

</p>

<p>Gratian s reign was notable for several tendencies, most of which highlight

continuing trends in the history of the later Roman empire.  First, there was the

continuing equation of Christianity with the office of emperor, which was exemplified

by Gratian s rejection of the title and robes of the <i>pontifex maximus</i>.  Second,

there was the continuing influence of barbarians becoming assimilated within the

empire.  Gratian had barbarian supporters as members of his court and army.  His

armor-bearer was an Alaman, and one of his <i>comes domesticorum</i> was the

Frankish king Mallobaudes.<a href="#37"><b>[[37]]</b></a>   It was also rumored that he angered the regular

legions by bringing in a group of Alans as his personal bodyguard and giving them

special preferences.<a href="#38"><b>[[38]]</b></a>   Finally, following the example of <a href="valens.html"><b>Valens</b></a>,

 he settled some

barbarian peoples throughout Moesia and Pannonia.<a href="#39"><b>[[39]]</b></a>   The trend of entrusting

barbarians with key positions of power and settling them within the empire would

only continue to grow.<a href="#40"><b>[[40]]</b></a>   Finally, the events surrounding his acclamation and

death show the power of the army in selecting and maintaining emperors during the

late empire.  Perhaps in another era Gratian would have been one of the more

noteworthy emperors, but, as Ammianus noted, Gratian s talents lay in the opposite

direction of what was needed for the empire at this time.<a href="#41"><b>[[41]]</b></a></p>
