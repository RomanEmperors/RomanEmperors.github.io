<h3>
Aelia Eudoxia (wife of Arcadius)</h3></center>

<center>
<h3>
Wendy Mayer</h3></center>

<center>Australian Catholic University</center>

<p>Much like the later empress <b><a href="dora.html">Theodora</a></b>,
Eudoxia has been the subject of a largely negative press. Zosimus (<i>Historia
nova</i> 5.18.8), writing almost a century after her death, records that
it was widely claimed that her fourth child, the only son and heir, <b><a href="theo2.html">Theodosius
II</a></b>, had been fathered by one of her husband's courtiers, John;
and himself goes on to describe her as "abnormally willful", stating that
she ultimately served the insatiable desires of the palace eunuchs and
the women who surrounded her, by whom, he alleges, she was controlled (5.24.2).
In a continuation of the use of excessively emotive terms he describes
her attitude towards the bishop of Constantinople at that time, John Chrysostom,
as one of "hatred" (5.23.2). Philostorgius, who lived in Constantinople
throughout
<b><a href="arcadius.html">Arcadius'</a></b> reign, is slightly
more positive in that he states that "the woman was not a dullard like
her husband" and that "she possessed no small degree of barbarian arrogance"
(<i>HE</i> 11.6).<b><a href="#N_1_">[[1]]</a></b> Ps-Martyrius, also a
direct contemporary, in his funeral oration on John Chrysostom alludes
to her as a second Jezebel, a captive of the devil "clothed in the insatiable
power of greed and considerable wickedness" (P 478a-b).[<b><a href="#N_2_">[2]]</a></b>
The overwhelming image of the empress as, at best, emotionally volatile
is not helped by Socrates' allegation that, on hearing that Eudoxia was
machinating to convoke a second synod against him, John Chrysostom preached
a notorious sermon which began: "Again Herodias rages again she dances,
again she seeks to have the head of John on a plate" (<i>HE</i> 6.18.4-5).<b><a href="#N_3_">[[3]]</a></b>
</p><p><span size="-1">F</span>rom such tenuous roots, a variety of negative
portrayals of Eudoxia have grown. At the very least, Eudoxia is usually
said to have moved with fellow conspirators to take over power on the death
of Eutropius.<b><a href="#N_4_">[[4]]</a></b> At the extreme she has been
characterized as "cruel, full of hatred, greedy for money and honors, hot-tempered,
of a corrupt nature, with a warped conscience", totally subject to her
passions, "employing in turns subterfuge and violence in order to satisfy
her ambitions" - in short, all of the worst excesses that one would expect
of a woman of barbarian lineage.<b><a href="#N_5_">[[5]]</a></b> Most views
fall somewhere in between, but the majority include elements of "barbarian"
volatility and of the notion of a power- and glory-hungry individual.<b><a href="#N_6_">[[6]]</a></b>
The few moderating views have been those of Geoffrey Nathan, who argues
that Eudoxia is more notorious than her real influence upon the eastern
principate warrants,<b><a href="#N_7_">[[7]]</a></b> and Kenneth Holum,
who reviews and presents the details of Eudoxia's life as empress with
a dispassionate eye.<b><a href="#N_8_">[[8]]</a></b>
</p><p>When attempting to recover the historical Eudoxia it takes a great deal
of care to sift fact from fiction. In particular, the sources which 'document'
her relationship with John Chrysostom and with other bishops who visited
Constantinople during her short life,<b><a href="#N_9_">[[9]]</a></b> reveal
a side to her role as empress which has been either underestimated or overlooked.
Attention to the way in which Eudoxia involved herself in ecclesiastical
affairs not only restores some much-needed balance to our picture of her,
but also helps to bring to light some of the motives behind the more negative
of the reactions to her in the sources.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><center>
<h5>
<span size="-1">Eudoxia's Early Life</span></h5></center>

<p><br>Little is known about Eudoxia's early life, other than that she
was the daughter of Bauto (Philostorgius, <i>HE</i> 11.6), a Frank of some
prominence in the western court, since he was <i>magister militum</i> in
the early 380s under <b><a href="gratian.html">Gratian </a></b>and a consul
in 385.<b><a href="#N_10_">[[10]]</a></b> Holum claims that her mother
was Roman and that she was therefore only a <i>semibarbara</i>, but it
is not clear from what source he derives that information.<b><a href="#N_11_">[[11]]</a></b>
Whatever the case, it is evident from the way she is portrayed in the sources
that her "barbarian" ancestry was sufficient for the label to be used to
effect against her. We next hear of her at Constantinople in the context
of the household of Promotus (Zos., 5.3.2), which gives rise to the assumption
that she had somehow made her way to the eastern capital after her father's
death in 388.<b><a href="#N_12_">[[12]]</a></b> Since Promotus was <i>magister
militum</i> in the east in 386-91, with a common link with Bauto in the
person of Arbogastes,<b><a href="#N_13_">[[13]]</a></b> who succeeded Bauto
as
<i>magister militum</i> in the west, it is possible that the transition
of Eudoxia from her father's household to that of Promotus may have occurred
before Bauto's death and have had something to do with Promotus' elevated
status in the eastern court at that time and her father's ambitions. Whatever
the case, as Holum has noted,<b><a href="#N_14_">[[14]]</a></b> Zosimus
asserts that after Promotus' death in 392, his two sons either lived with
or moved in the ambit of the sons (<b><a href="honorius.html">Honorius</a></b>
and <b><a href="arcadius.html">Aracadius</a></b>) of the emperor, <b><a href="theo1.html">Theodosius</a></b>,
and that one of Promotus' sons had Eudoxia with him. If this is the case,
then Eudoxia was raised in close proximity to the eastern court, under
the tutelage of first Promotus and then his widow, Marsa, and was well
known to <b><a href="arcadius.html">Arcadius</a></b> before their marriage.&nbsp;
In support of a privileged upbringing and perhaps also the possibility
that she was being groomed as a vehicle for her father's or foster-father's
ambitions, is the information that Eudoxia had access to education, since
we are told that her former tutor Pansophius was consecrated bishop of
Nicomedia in 402 (Soz., <i>HE</i> 8.6.6).
</p><p>Why Eudoxia was <b><a href="arcadius.html">Arcadius'</a></b> bride of
choice, and why the wedding was conducted on 27 April 395, scarcely three
months after the death of his father on 17 January of that year and well
before <b><a href="theo1.html">Theodosius'</a></b> body had arrived back
in Constantinople for burial, are open to debate, but best explained by
either the desire of the grand chamberlain Eutropius to wrest control of
the young emperor away from Rufinus, the praetorian prefect of the east
and appointed guardian, or the desire of the young emperor himself to take
control of his own life.<b><a href="#N_15_">[[15]]</a></b> Several factors
lead to this conclusion. Rufinus was distracted on the death of <b><a href="theo1.html">Theodosius</a></b>
by Stilicho's attempt to take control of both east and west; Promotus and
Rufinus had been bitter enemies and it had been Rufinus who had engineered
Promotus' downfall (Zos., 4.51); and Rufinus had a daughter of marriageable
age through whom he intended to secure his control over <b><a href="arcadius.html">Arcadius</a></b>.
Under these conditions, whatever the motivation, <b><a href="arcadius.html">Arcadius'
</a></b>selection
of and swift marriage to a wife from the household of Promotus would have
been a slap in the face to the ambitions of Rufinus. To soften the story
and to account for <b><a href="arcadius.html">Arcardius</a></b><u>'</u>
choice of Eudoxia as a bride over the daughter of Rufinus, it is alleged
that Eudoxia was of extraordinary beauty and that Eutropius manipulated
<b><a href="arcadius.html">Arcadius</a></b>
into favoring her by showing him a portrait (Zos. 5.3), but it is unlikely
that this is more than a convenient fiction, especially so when we consider
that they had known each other for some six or seven years.
</p><center>
<h5>
<span size="-1">Eudoxia's role at court</span></h5></center>
It is only after her rise to the position of empress, namely in the nine
and a half years between 27 April, 395 and her premature death on 6 October,
404 that we have an opportunity to observe Eudoxia at work, and then only
in a very piecemeal way. From the point of view of her role as a Roman
matron and as the vehicle for securing the Theodosian dynasty, Eudoxia
was a model consort. Once she fell pregnant in late 396, she produced children
with increasing rapidity. Out of seven pregnancies, five children survived
infancy (Flaccilla b. 17 June, 397; Pulcheria b. 19 January, 399; Arcadia
b. 3 April, 400; <b><a href="theo2.html">Theodosius II</a></b> b. 10 April,
401; and Marina b. 10 February, 403).<b><a href="#N_16_">[[16]]</a></b>
If <i>ps-Martyrius</i> is to be believed, two pregnancies (due late in
403 and late in 404, respectively) ended not in miscarriages, as previously
supposed, but stillbirths, the second leading to the death of the empress
from hemorrhaging and infection.<b><a href="#N_17_">[[17]]</a></b>
<p>The precise nature of Eudoxia's role in political affairs is more difficult
to assess. It is probable that her fecundity gave her considerable standing
at court. It is also clear that in the progress of events the rise to dominance
of the Gothic general Gainas,<span size="-1"> </span>the dismissal of Eutropius
from office in late July or early August 399, the latter's execution in
mid-September or later in 399,<b><a href="#N_18_">[[18]]</a></b> and the
subsequent proclamation of Eudoxia as <i>Augusta</i> on 9 January, 400
are connected and were defining points in the lives of both Eudoxia and
her husband. Who was behind the move to have the honorific title bestowed
on her, however, and what it meant in effect, are matters of dispute.<b><a href="#N_19_">[[19]]</a></b>
In terms of her standing within the eastern capital and provinces her elevation
to <i>Augusta</i> did result in a real and documentable change in status.
Eudoxia was now permitted to wear the <i>paludamentum</i> of purple and
the imperial diadem. From the time of her elevation until her death coins
were struck in gold, silver and bronze by the eastern mints. These bore
images of her clothed as an <i>Augusta</i>, with the cognomen Aelia, and
on the obverse a picture of a disembodied hand reaching down to crown her
with a wreath. As Holum has pointed out, the cognomen and the image of
the hand of God were all carefully selected iconographic tools designed
to cement her place in the Theodosian succession and to promote the divine
origins of her coronation.<b><a href="#N_20_">[[20]]</a></b> In addition
to the minting of coins, not long after the proclamation official images
of Eudoxia (<i>laureatae</i>), requiring a public reception similar to
those of a male Augustus, were circulated throughout the provinces and
within a few years had reached Italy and the western court, leading to
a letter of criticism to <b><a href="arcadius.html">Arcadius</a></b> from
<b><a href="honorius.html">Honorius</a></b>.<b><a href="#N_21_">[[21]]</a></b>
The silver statue of Eudoxia erected on a porphyry column and marble base
in the Forum Augusteum of Constantinople by the urban prefect Simplicius
in late 403,<b><a href="#N_22_">[[22]]</a></b> is an example of support
in at least inner eastern imperial circles for the public promotion of
the empress as <i>Augusta</i>.
</p><p>The image of Eudoxia as the symbolic partner in a divinely instituted
<i>imperium</i>,
that was so carefully and widely cultivated at a public level, however,
can not be thought to reflect the workings of the eastern principate in
practice. Whatever the speculation at the time about her private role in
court intrigue and in the twin exiles of John Chrysostom, Eudoxia had no
legislative capacity, no <i>imperium</i> in any concrete sense, and there
are no grounds for thinking that within the political sphere of the palace
she ever overtly moved beyond the constraints imposed upon her. In line
with Nathan's argument regarding <b><a href="arcadius.html">Arcadius'</a></b>
activities during the years 400-404, it would be a mistake to see her as
a partner in power. On the other hand, the sources do suggest that it is
<span size="-1">valid
to view her as n</span>onetheless powerful by virtue of her role as a conduit
to the emperor's favors.<b><a href="#N_23_">[[23]]</a></b> Whether Eudoxia
was manipulated by others in this regard, as Zosimus alleges, or whether
she used her position to manipulate for her own ends those who sought her
assistance, is difficult to determine.
</p><center>
<h5>
<span size="-1">Eudoxia as patron of the Nicene church</span></h5></center>
Where we do see Eudoxia exercising independent authority is not in the
political realm but the ecclesiastical. Holum has noted her patronage of
the nighttime anti-Arian processions instigated in Constantinople by the
Nicene bishop, to which she contributed at her own expense silver crosses
with candles and the services of one of her eunuchs, Brison, as choirmaster.<b><a href="#N_24_">[[24]]</a></b>
Her role in the spectacular public events surrounding the importation of
new martyrs' remains to Constantinople is also significant.<b><a href="#N_25_">[[25]]</a></b>
On at least one occasion she persuaded <b><a href="arcadius.html">Arcadius
</a></b>to
stay home on the initial day of the celebrations, instead drawing all eyes
to herself by solemnly following the coffin throughout the night, divested
of her Augustal clothing and bodyguards, and participating prominently
in the vigil at the martyrium.<b><a href="#N_26_">[[26]]</a></b> We see
the same focus on the empress as the half of the imperial couple concerned
with religious affairs in the events surrounding John Chrysostom's return
to Constantinople after his first brief exile. Eudoxia is the sole imperial
representative in the public <i>adventus</i> ceremony played out on the
Bosporus, where again she is seen exhibiting her piety (<i>eusebeia</i>)
prominently in the midst of the populace.<b><a href="#N_27_">[[27]]</a></b>
<p>The impression that Eudoxia seized the model of the emperor as patron
of the church that had been established by <b><a href="conniei.html">Constantine
</a></b>and
then, on her elevation to
<i>Augusta</i>, moved to detach the role from
<b><a href="arcadius.html">Arcadius</a></b> and to appropriate it for herself,
creating an identity which allowed her to operate by divine mandate at
her husband's side, yet on her own cognizance, is reinforced by other events.
Palladius (<i>Dial</i>. 8) and Sozomen (<i>HE </i>8.8) are both clear that,
when the "Origenist" monks from Egypt appeal directly to Eudoxia for assistance,
it is she who decrees that a synod be convoked and Theophilus, the bishop
of Alexandria, be called to answer his case before it. Palladius adds that
she was well informed as to the circumstances of the monks' case before
they approached her. Neither expresses any surprise at the authority of
her actions. Again, at the time of the dispute between John Chrysostom
and Severian of Gabala, it is Eudoxia who appeals to John to reconcile
himself with Severian and who then forces his hand by recalling Severian
to Constantinople from Chalcedon (Socr., <i>HE</i> 6.11; Soz.,
<i>HE</i>
8.10). It is also telling that in the months prior to John's second and
final exile, when bishops who supported his cause were attempting to sway
imperial opinion, it is to Eudoxia that appeals were addressed, not her
husband (Palladius, <i>Dial</i>. 9).
<br>&nbsp;
</p><center>
<h5>
<span size="-1">Assessment</span></h5></center>

<p><br>When the sources present an empress, on the one hand, as totally
manipulated, and, on the other, as the machinator in various plots, while
at the same time playing on conventional stereotypes of the barbarian woman,
it sends up a flag of warning. Eudoxia exhibits many of the same qualities
(piety, humility, fecundity) as her predecessor Flaccilla, who like her
was a <i>barbara</i>, was honored with the title <i>Augusta</i>, and saw
her imperial image disseminated on coins and other media throughout the
provinces.<b><a href="#N_28_">[[28]]</a></b> Yet the two have received
a markedly different reception. This requires some explanation. Eudoxia
became exposed as a target on two fronts. The first was her proclamation
as <i>Augusta</i> only six months into her third pregnancy, before she
had borne a male heir for the principate. It is possible that the subsequent
birth of a daughter led people to question the appropriateness of the move
and contributed to the rumor, when she finally bore a son in her fourth
pregnancy, that he had been fathered elsewhere. The second front was her
adoption of the role of patron of the imperially favored (i.e. Nicene)
church. While her guiding hand on this front enabled her to help direct
the development of the dynastic religion for her husband and children,
it left her dangerously exposed to criticism by those who objected to the
directions in which she bestowed her largesse and to the content of her
decisions. It is in this light that we should view the charges that she
was "arrogant", that she "hated" the bishop of Constantinople and actively
sought his downfall, and that she had embarked upon a "war against the
church". Her contribution to ecclesiastical affairs at Constantinople,
and throughout the eastern provinces via the bishops who sought her patronage
when visiting the capital, needs acknowledgment. It is also probable that,
through establishing a model for the engagement of imperial women of the
east at a high level in the ecclesiastical sphere, she paved the way for
her daughter, Pulcheria.

Those of von Hahn-Hahn, Seeck and Holum represent the few in which Eudoxia
has been examined in her own right. More frequently she has been depicted
in terms of her "conflict" with the bishop John Chrysostom. The chapter
devoted to her by Holum remains the most complete study to date.

</p><p><a name="N_1_"></a>[[1]]The Greek term for "woman" used by Philostorgius
(<i>to gynaion</i>) has a patronizing, even contemptuous ring.
</p><p><a name="N_2_"></a>[[2]]Ps-Martyrius has recently been identified as
Cosmas, a deacon who had been baptized by John Chrysostom and who was an
ardent supporter of his cause. The funerary speech itself has been dated
to the winter of 407/8, making it a critical witness to events at Constantinople
in the years 398-407. See T.D. Barnes, "The Funerary Speech for John Chrysostom
(<i>BHG</i><sup>3</sup> 871 = CPG 6517)", <i>Studia Patristica</i> 37 (2001)
328-45, who provides a translation of the passages in which Cosmas (Ps-Martyrius)
describes with relish the still-birth suffered by Eudoxia at the time of
each of Chrysostom's exiles (336-7). It is noteworthy that he uses the
same term as Philostorgius for "the woman", when referring to Eudoxia,
which Barnes translates as "the hag". For Ps-Martyrius Eudoxia is the instigator
of a war against the church (P 524b), which Theophilus, bishop of Alexandria,
joins as co-conspirator.

Eudoxie n'obéissait qu'à ses passions: injuste, cruelle,
elle était femme à ne reculer devant rien pour la satisfaction
de ses appétits, employant tour à tour la ruse et la violence
pour satisfaire ses ambitions". In adopting this view she builds on the
scholarship of Amédée Thierry and Aimé Puech before
her.
</p><p><a name="N_6_"></a>[[6]]C. Baur, <i>John Chrysostom and His Time</i>
II. <i>Constantinople</i>, eng. trans., Westminster MD, 1960, 32 describes
her as possessed of "a vivacious, sanguine temperament" and proceeds to
damn her with faint praise: "Eudoxia was not without good qualities. At
the side of an upright man, she might have become a distinguished empress.
But natural strength of character was lacking in her, and as far as guiding
the Emperor was concerned, she was as yet too young, too inexperienced
and, above all, too feminine. Her credulity, and her hasty passionate disposition
were soon made the most of, by all sorts of tale-bearing and insinuations"
(33). This view that her pairing with a "weak" emperor brought out her
vanity and ambitions can be seen in F.X. Funk, "Johannes Chrysostomus und
der Hof von Konstantinopel", <i>Theologische Quartalschrift</i> 57 (1875)
458: "An der Seite eines schwachen und beschränkten Gatten, der stets
das Bedürfnis empfand, von Andern geleitet zu werden, mußte
sie selbst die Herrschaft an sich ziehen, wenn sie nicht unter dem Befehl
eines Dritten stehen wollte, und es war ihr nicht genug, die oberste Leitung
der Geschäfte thatsächlich in ihrer Hand zu haben, sie wollte
auch rechtlich und gesetzlich Herrscherin sein, vertauschte darum mit Beginn
des Jahres 400 ihren seitherigen Titel <i>Nobilissima</i> mit dem Titel
<i>Augusta</i>
und ließ, um gleich dem Kaiser die Huldigung und Berehrung des Volkes
in ihrem Bildniß entgegen zu nehmen, ihre Statue in den Provinzen
des Reiches umherführen." J.N.D. Kelly, <i>Golden Mouth. The Story
of John Chrysostom - Ascetic, Preacher, Bishop</i>, London, 1995, 110,
who presents a less emotive view, follows Philostorgius in stating that
she outstripped Arcadius in intelligence and therefore quickly dominated
him, and in the use of adjectives like "volatile" and "impulsive" (272),
and "vivacious and strong-willed" (110). Cf. J.H.W.G. Liebeschuetz, <i>Barbarians
and Bishops. Army, Church, and State in the Age of Arcadius and Chrysostom</i>,
Oxford, 1990, who calls her "passionate and easily offended" (196) and
"extremely strong-willed and at the same time hypersensitive" (202).

DIR: "While there were several events in which she played a crucial part,
they were not terribly important moments during Arcardius' reign". Liebeschuetz,
<i>Barbarians</i>, 196-202 also downgrades her role.

see Alan Cameron in A. Cameron and J. Long with L. Sherry, <i>Barbarians
and Politics at the Court of Arcadius</i>, Berkeley, 1993, 170-3, who argues
that it was the praetorian prefect (<i>praefectus praetorio per orientem</i>)
Aurelian, who, with the courtiers Saturninus and John, had formed a power
bloc and was attempting to use Eudoxia to exert his influence over Arcadius.
Holum, <i>Theodosian Empresses</i>, 67, had argued against this possibility
on the grounds that Gainas was in control of Constantinople and Aurelian
and his associates already in exile at the time. He went on to propose
that the initiative may have come from Eudoxia herself. Cameron's carefully
revised chronology of events, however, which places the exile of Aurelian,
Saturninus and John only in April 400 (ibid., xii), undercuts Holum's arguments.
Holum's alternative suggestion (69) that the court promoted Eudoxia in
response to Gainas in an attempt to rouse public support for the eastern
principate at a time of crisis likewise falters on the chronology, but
otherwise bears some merit.

that accompanied the erection of the statues as the final straw in the
strained relationship between Eudoxia and the bishop, John Chrysostom.

and at the same time using her private resources to keep his whereabouts
secret and his enemies at bay. At the close of the homily he styles her
as "mother of the churches, feeder of monks, patroness of saints, staff
of beggars". Cf. Soz., <i>HE</i> 8.18, who appears to have had access to
the sermon, and who adds that Eudoxia sent her personal eunuch Brison to
fetch John and then housed him on his return at her own suburban estate,
Marianae. If the <i>Life of Porphyry</i> by Mark the Deacon is accepted
as a valid source, then Eudoxia's securing of an edict permitting destruction
of the Marneion at Gaza is an example of her exercise of ecclesiastical
patronage beyond the confines of Constantinople. She is alleged to have
provided thirty-two marble columns for the Christian church to be built
on the site. See Holum, <i>Theodosian Empresses</i>, 54-6.
