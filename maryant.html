</p><p><b>Introduction</b></p></center>

<p>At the death of his first wife, <b><a href="bertha.html">Bertha of Sulzbach</a></b>
in 1158, <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel I Comnenus</a></b> was left with
one surviving daughter, <b><a href="maryp.html">Maria 'Porphyrogenita</a></b>'
who was as yet unmarried. The need for a male heir to the throne was of
paramount importance and <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></b> decided
to use this as an opportunity to cement his alliance with the Frankish
kingdom of Jerusalem and its dependent principalities. Whereas the emperor
<b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel I Comnenus</a></b>' grandfather <b><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius
I</a></b> and his father <b><a href="johncomn.html">John II</a></b> had
attempted to solve the question of Latin Crusader Principalities in Syria
and Palestine through absorption, whether by treaty or by conquest, <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's</a></b>
policy differed from theirs in his acceptance of the independence of the
principalities as a fait accompli.<b><a href="#N_1_">[[1]]</a></b> So come
Eastertide (12 April) 1159 <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></b> made
a triumphal procession through Antioch, waited on by the prince of Antioch
and followed by the king of Jerusalem, who were doubtless pleased to have
a powerful Christian suzerain in the region. At Antioch, Choniates tells
us, <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel </a></b>took part in a tournament
with blunted lances, in which the men of Reynald of Chatillon, prince of
Antioch, were outmatched and <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manue</a></b>l excelled
himself by unhorsing two knights with one blow.<b><a href="#N_2_">[[2]]</a></b>
About this time, <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></b> conceived his
idea of a marriage alliance with one of the principalities. Marguerite-Constance
of Antioch, the daughter of Raymond of Poitiers and Constance of Antioch
(who had married Reynald of Chatillon after Raymond's death), was one of
the two main contenders for the position of <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's</a></b>
new bride, the other being Melisende, sister of Raymond III of Tripoli.
After negotiations for an alliance with Tripoli had fallen through (Antioch
being the better alliance), <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></b> had
Marguerite-Constance escorted to Constantinople by an entourage led by
Alexius Comnenus, the Grand <i>Dux</i> (son of <b><a href="annacom.html">Anna
Comnena</a></b>), a certain <b><a href="nickbry.html">Nicephorus Bryennius</a></b>,
and the eparch Andronicus Camaterus. The marriage took place in St Sophia
on Christmas Day 1161 (we unfortunately have no rhetorical texts commemorating
the event).<b><a href="#N_3_">[[3]]</a></b> The princess had been born
in the 1140s and so was probably in her mid-teens;<b><a href="#N_4_">[[4]]</a></b>
she now took the name Maria.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times">Maria's appearance</span></b></p></center>

<p><span face="GreekTimes">The alliance with Antioch clearly was more attractive
to the Byzantines than that with Tripoli, and William of Tyre describes
with some disgust <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's </a></b>'jilting'
of Melisende and the ill feelings it aroused. He portrays Melisende as
a maiden of fine character and ability, and itemises the trousseau that
had been prepared for her as the future empress of Byzantium by her family
and friends. This injustice to Melisende led to vengeful attacks by Raymond
on the Byzantine empire in retaliation for his sister's rejection.<b><a href="#N_5_">[[5]]</a></b>
Indeed, one of the main deciding factors may have been Marguerite-Constance's
</span><span face="Times">exceptional beauty</span><span face="GreekTimes">.
Choniates describes her as of outstanding appearance, like the 'laughter-loving'
Aphrodite or one of the other goddesses of ancient times,<b><a href="#N_6_">[[6]]</a></b>
while he comments on</span><span face="Times"> 'the radiance of her appearance,
her pearly countenance, an even disposition, candour, and charm of speech'.</span><b><a href="#N_7_">[[7]]</a></b>
<span face="GreekTimes">Cinnamus in fact implies that she was chosen specifically
for her beauty, after relating an unlikely story that an extended illness
prevented Melisende from embarking for Constantinople, and during this
period it was luckily discovered that she was of illegitimate birth, and
thus unsuitable to marry the emperor. The envoy Camaterus was then sent
to Antioch, and he picked out the younger, Marguerite, as the more beautiful
of the two sisters and the future imperial bride, as her beauty was so
dazzling that her escort were astounded, no Byzantines ever before having
seen so handsome a girl. Constantine Manasses, too, one of the original
embassy to Palestine in 1160 and later metropolitan of Naupactus, described
her radiant beauty as so dazzling that the onlooker could only imagine
a thunderbolt or the full moon fallen to earth: her skin was white as snow
or marble, she was blonde, of good complexion, symmetrical of figure and
upright in stature; her hair was thick and of a deep gold, her eyebrows
well rounded, her eyelids well-shaped, her glance gentle and gleaming,
her lips red, her mouth well-drawn, (if she smiled just a little her beauty
was quite overpowering), her nose well-turned, her movement and gait easy
and measured, and her manner sedate and most appropriate.</span><b><a href="#N_8_">[[8]]</a></b>
However stereotyped this description, it is clear that Maria was considered
an asset in the public role of the empress (perhaps especially in contrast
to the more prosaic <b><a href="bertha.html">Bertha of Sulzbach</a></b>).
</p><p><span face="Times">Maria is depicted in a Vatican manuscript next to
her husband, with her pale rose complexion contrasting with his manly suntan.
She is shown with blonde hair and as strikingly attractive. Her imperial
regalia includes an ornate crown and a blue-patterned red dress with wide
sleeves and a high collar decorated with pearls, while her robe is studded
with blue and red precious stones. She also wears the red imperial shoes
and carries a jewelled sceptre.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_9_">[[9]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;
She was, clearly, exceptionally attractive: after her assassination by
her husband's cousin Andronicus, all public portraits of her were repainted
in the form of a wrinkled old woman to prevent the passers-by from commiserating
her fate.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_10_">[[10]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="GreekTimes">Choniates even recalls Maria's attractions as
outstanding in his speech to celebrate the wedding of <b><a href="isaaciiang.html">Isaac
II Angelus</a></b> and Margaret-Maria of Hungary c. 1186, perhaps because
the Byzantines saw Margaret as Maria's western 'relative'. Maria's descent
was viewed with pride by the Byzantines. Manasses considers her as descended
from 'Caesars' and rulers of the West, while court poets address her as
'Italian-born' and 'daughter of princes' in poems in which she is described
as dedicating offerings to the Church, praying for <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's</a></b>
success, making gifts to the emperor, and asking for the safe delivery
of a child. She also appears in one poem which describes a work of art,
executed before 1169, in which Maria, being blessed by Christ, is portrayed
alongside the emperor <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></b>.<b><a href="#N_11_">[[11]]</a></b>
However, apart from this commissioning of occasional pieces from court
poets, she appears to have had no interest in acting as a patron of literature
or commissioning more extensive works, perhaps surprisingly in view of
the fact that Maria</span><span face="Times">'</span><span face="GreekTimes">s
father, Raymond of Poitiers, was also uncle of Eleanor of Aquitaine.</span>
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times">Maria and Manuel I</span></b></p></center>

<p><span face="Times">The only involvement in politics by Maria of Antioch
during </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's
</a></span></b><span face="Times">reign which has been recorded is when
in 1167 the interpreter Aaron Isaakios, who had learnt 'the Latin tongue'
when carried off to Sicily by the Normans at their sack of Corinth in 1147,
advised western envoys during an audience not to accede too quickly to
the emperor's demands. Maria, who understood what he was saying, later
revealed his treachery to </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></span></b><span face="Times">
who had him blinded:</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">"While translating messages carried by envoys from
the Western nations before the emperor, he perceived that they did not
run counter to the emperor's wishes, and admonished the envoys that they
were too quick to accede to the demand for payments, advising them not
to concede so facilely, since the emperor would regard them with greater
affection and they would be more highly esteemed by those who spoke their
own language. The audience was concluded, leaving the emperor ignorant
of Aaron's admonitions, these acts of insubordination concealed thanks
to the use of a foreign tongue. The empress, a Latin by race who understood
exactly what was said, pondered over the issues as they were set forth
and disclosed everything to the emperor. Vexed by what he heard, he punished
Aaron cruelly by extinguishing the light of his eyes and confiscating all
his possessions." </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_12_">[[12]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">Clearly Maria was involved in the reception of foreign
envoys and must have been a useful associate for </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></span></b><span face="Times">
in his diplomatic relations with the crusader states and western nations.
However, for several years she was childless. The throne was still the
inheritance of her step-daughter </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="maryp.html">Maria</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and whatever husband whom </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></span></b><span face="Times">
might chose for her (in 1165/66 she was engaged to Béla-Alexius
of Hungary and the couple named as his successors). In addition, Alexius,
one of Manuel's illegitimate children by his niece Theodora, who greatly
resembled his father, was prominent at court with the titles <i>sebastocrator</i>
and <i>Caesar</i>, though </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></span></b><span face="Times">
did not envisage his succession to the throne.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_13_">[[13]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
When the empress suffered a miscarriage of a male child in 1166 it was
considered a tragedy; </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></span></b><span face="Times">
at the time was investigating the doctrinal views of Demetrius of Lampe
which were debated at the local council of Constantinople in 1166-1167,
When one of the imperial household quietly reported to him that the empress
had suffered a miscarriage, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel
</a></span></b><span face="Times">threw himself on the floor at the priests'
feet with the words; 'Just now, holy fathers, world has come from the women's
quarters, saying that a male child, my greatest hope, has been born untimely',
and asking them to supplicate for the birth of an heir to the throne, should
he have taken the correct side in the controversy.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_14_">[[14]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
The serious accusations which led to the downfall in 1167 of the commander
Alexius Axouch, husband of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
niece Maria, included dabbling in sorcery and consorting with a Latin 'wizard'
who provided drugs to prevent the emperor having an heir.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_15_">[[15]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Finally, more than seven years after their marriage, on 14 September 1169
Maria became the mother of a long hoped for heir, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius
II</a></span></b><span face="Times">, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
only legitimate son.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_16_">[[16]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">The birth of a legitimate son was therefore a time
of triumph:</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">"The imperial birth chamber, the Porphyra, was adorned
in readiness; the roof was covered with thick purple textiles 'woven in
dense hemispheres' by the palace weavers, while the outside walls were
hung with silks. Inside was a gilded four-poster maternity bed draped with
gold-embroidered curtains and pearl-studded covers. Beside this stood a
small couch, also richly covered, for receiving the new-born baby..."</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_17_">[[17]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">Choniates describes the preparation of the Purple
Chamber and how the presence of the emperor eased his wife's labour-pains.
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></span></b><span face="Times">
kept frequently glancing at the astrologer in attendance who predicted
a great and successful future for the baby.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_18_">[[18]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel
</a></span></b><span face="Times">was concerned to ensure </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius'</a></span></b><span face="Times">
succession shoud he die while Alexius was still a minor, and on 24 March
1171, eighteen months after </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius'</a></span></b><span face="Times">
birth, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></span></b><span face="Times">
had his officials, nobles and the patriarch and synod take an oath of fidelity
to himself and his son. Should </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></span></b><span face="Times">
die before </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexiico.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">
came of age, they swore to accept </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">
as emperor. Maria would be regent, as long as she became a nun and was
canonically tonsured, and protected the interests of the empire and her
son.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_19_">[[19]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Maria actually headed a regency council of twelve, which included the patriarch
Theodosius Boradiotes.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_20_">[[20]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
In insisting on Maria's becoming a nun and thus hindering her remarriage,
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></span></b><span face="Times">
was trying to prevent the possibility of her marrying again and thus endangering
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius'</a></span></b><span face="Times">
rights to the throne. The oath included a clause that stated, 'And should
I see or perceive or hear anything bringing dishonour to you or inflicting
injury to your crown, I shall relay this information to you and thwart
any such attempt as far as I am able.' Andronicus later made good use of
this clause in his overthrow of the empress.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_21_">[[21]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">Whatever her own wishes, after </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
death on 24 September 1180, Maria took the veil under the name 'Xene' ('foreigner'),
the monastic name also taken by Anna Dalassena and </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johncomn.htm#N_xx">Piroska
</a></span></b><span face="Times">(wife of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johncomn.html">John
II Comnenus</a></span></b><span face="Times">) and headed the regency for
her eleven year old son </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius
II</a></span></b><span face="Times">: of course, as the mother of the heir
she took precedence over the patriarch.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_22_">[[22]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
The name perhaps signified her feeling of isolation in Byzantium. Unfortunately,
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
pro-Latin policies had led to intensive criticism,</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_23_">[[23]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and Maria was to be targeted as the most obvious 'Latin' in the capital
and as a regent with clear pro-Latin sympathies. She did not, of course,
retire to a convent, but merely changed her imperial robes for the monastic
habit. The fact that she was personally not committed to becoming a nun
can be seen by the fact that only a few months after </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
death she was rumoured to be involved in a love-affair with Alexius the
<i>protosebastos</i> and <i>protovestiarios</i>, the most senior of the
<i>sebastoi</i>, to whom she entrusted the affairs of state. Alexius was
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
nephew, son of his elder brother Andronicus, and had been <i>protovestiarios</i>
(titular head of the imperial household) since 1176.</span><b><a href="#N_24_">[[24]]</a></b>
He could thus be seen to have a justifiable claim on the throne, especially
in view of the fact that his elder brother the <i>protosebastos</i> John
had died in 1176.
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times">The new regent</span></b></p></center>

<p><span face="Times">Maria and Alexius the <i>protosebastos </i>surrounded
themselves with Latins, a situation which the Constantinopolitans viewed
with misgivings. Westerners had become increasingly unpopular during </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's
</a></span></b><span face="Times">reign, and the populace were well aware
of Maria's origins, and saw the policies of her regime as pro-Latin.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_25_">[[25]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
This was to be exploited by both </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="maryp.html">Maria
Porphyrogenita</a></span></b><span face="Times"> and by </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="andycomn.html">Andronicus
I</a></span></b><span face="Times"> in his bid for power. A second factor
making Maria and her lover unpopular was their channelling of state revenues
into their own purses.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_26_">[[26]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
With rank and revenue being diverted to the<i> protosebastos</i>, Maria
became generally criticised at court, where she was surrounded by ambitious
Comnenian relations, all of whom had designs on government and the revenue.
Moreover, while her son, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius
II</a></span></b><span face="Times">, was the rightful emperor, he had
not actually been crowned. Perhaps unconsciously, in this dangerous situation,
she used her charms to win the support of her officials and courtiers.
Eustathius, for example, sees her as deliberately employing her attractions,
while pretending to hide them behind her monastic habit: 'she was a woman
well ripened in love affairs, although she professed to hide them, veiling
the sunshine of her charms in a spiritual manner with a cloud of dark garments'.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_27_">[[27]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Naturally, the court was full of relations who felt that they would have
been equally appropriate suitors and advisors to such an empress. Her 'lover'
the <i>protosebastos</i> Alexius was a widower of about forty-five years
of age, and hence a not ineligible match for the empress: Choniates records
that it was rumoured that he was planning to depose the young monarch and
to marry Maria and seize the throne.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_28_">[[28]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
However unfounded the accusation, it could only damage the empress and
her regime. In order to marry the<i> protosebastos</i> she would have had
to break her oath to </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel:</a></span></b><span face="Times">
moreover she was, by choice, a nun (a decision which could not be revoked),
while marrying her nephew by marriage would have been incestuous and strictly
against canon law. It is, however, conceivable that the public reaction
to Maria's supposed relationship with the protosebastos might have been
affected by knowledge both of her sister Philippa's affair some years earlier
with Andronicus (I) Komnenos and of her brother Bohemond III's divorce
from one of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's

Sibylla,</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_29_">[[29]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
as a result of which Bohemond had been excommunicated by Patriarch Aimery
of Antioch.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_30_">[[30]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
While a 'Byzantine' would of course never consider such outrageous conduct,
who could tell how a 'westerner' would behave if tempted?</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">The <i>protosebastos</i> was not Maria's only suitor,
of course: Choniates scathingly describes how some officials and courtiers
started curling their hair, wearing fancy necklaces, and splashing on perfume
to demonstrate their eligibility. Others focused their efforts on making
inroads into the treasury and climbing inexorably up the public ladder.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_31_">[[31]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
The one person who was left out of the equation was the young emperor.
In everyone's eyes, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">
seemed an inexperienced pre-teen, who spent his time in such juvenile pursuits

pretext for arguing for the necessity for his return to the capital: not
only was the <i>protosebastos </i>threatening the position of the rightful
young emperor, but the ugly gossip about the emperor's mother was 'being
proclaimed from the wall tops and lying in wait at the gates of princes
and being echoed throughout the universe'.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_33_">[[33]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">

The state clearly needed a strong guiding hand. Public morality needed
to be supervised.</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">Indeed, the regime was clearly not a success. Choniates
speaks of great extravagance: it was generally considered that revenues
collected by earlier emperors (who had stripped even the poverty-stricken)
were now being channelled into the pockets of the <i>protosebastos</i>
and empress. In his discussion of the diversion of public monies, Choniates
even uses the Greek satirical poet Archilochos' phrase 'into the belly
of the whore', a very damning indictment, as his previous narrative had
been careful to only mention the liaison between Maria and the <i>protosebastos</i>
as a 'report' which was in circulation.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_34_">[[34]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Unfortunately, the <i>protosebastos</i>, according to William of Tyre,
was avaricious and 'as niggardly with the imperial treasure as though he
had earned it himself'. This would hardly endear him to other family members
at court, and his unpopularity was exacerbated by his arrogance and failure
to consult the opinions of other officials (who were after all mostly his
relations).</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_35_">[[35]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
The court saw it as particularly infuriating that anyone who captured the
fancy of the empress and <i>protosebastos</i> could direct government policy
and revenue.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_36_">[[36]])</a></span></b><span face="Times">Still
worse was the regime's not unnatural pro-Latin policies: according to William
of Tyre the <i>protosebastos</i> (doubtless under Maria's influence) 'availed
himself of the advice and assistance of the Latins, and as far as possible
made them his friends'.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_37_">[[37]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
The young </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius
II</a></span></b><span face="Times"> might have had no interest in affairs
of state, but it was still quite unacceptable that he had been persuaded
to ratify a decree that every state document he signed had to be validated
by the <i>protosebastos </i>himself in 'frog-green' ink (green ink being
an emblem of the rank of<i> protovestiarios</i>).</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_38_">[[38]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
To make matters worse, the <i>protosebastos</i> was not particularly efficient
as ruler: Choniates laughs at him for spending most of the day sleeping
and shutting out the daylight with carpets and purple ('imperial') curtains.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_39_">[[39]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">

<p><b>The 'holy war'</b></p></center>

<p>Maria in fact had two main enemies opposed to her as regent. The first,
and closest at hand, was her stepdaughter, <b><a href="maryp.html">Maria
Porphyrogenita</a></b> who, together with her fiancé Béla-Alexius
of Hungary, had been <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's</a></b> heir before
the birth of her brother <b><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius II</a></b>,
after which her engagement had been terminated.<b><a href="#N_41_">[[41]]</a></b>
The other was Andronicus, <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's</a></b> cousin,
currently in exile, who was to achieve power by manipulating anti-Latin
sentiment. Both enemies utilised the citizens' belief in the love-affair
between Maria and the <i>protosebastos</i>, and the consequent danger to
the rightful emperor.
</p><p>On 2 March 1180 <b><a href="maryp.html">Maria (Porphyrogenita)</a></b>
had married Renier of Montferrat, when Renier was about seventeen years
of age; this was on the same occasion as the celebration of the marriage
of <b><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius</a></b> and <b><a href="aggiefran.html">Agnes-Anna
of Savoy</a></b>. Maria was almost elderly for a Byzantine bride at nearly
thirty years of age (she was born in March 1152).<b><a href="#N_42_">[[42]]</a></b>
The empress faced especially vigorous opposition from this step-daughter,
who had remained unmarried in the palace with her step-mother, who was
after all not much older than herself, for more than a decade after the
birth of her brother and for nineteen years after the marriage of Maria
and her father. It must have been inevitable that a state of mutual hostility
existed between the two Marias before the regency even commenced. A Byzantine
princess would normally have expected to have been bespoken by a suitable
imperial suitor in her early teens: she may well have felt her interests
neglected, and certainly the poem written in 1180 by an admirer of the
empress to celebrate the arrival of<b><a href="aggiefran.html"> Agnes-Anna
of Savoy</a></b>, the young bride of <b><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius
II</a></b>, had emphasised the superiority of the new Latin princess over
her relatively elderly sister-in-law.<b><a href="#N_43_">[[43]]</a></b>
Maria of Antioch is herself spendidly represented in the manuscript at
fol. 7r as one of the central figures.<b><a href="#N_44_">[[44]]</a></b>
</p><p>As early as February 1181, a number of family members, headed by <b><a href="maryp.html">Maria
Porphyrogenita</a></b> and her husband and <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's</a></b>
illegitimate son Alexius the <i>sebastocrator</i>, conspired to assassinate
the <i>protosebastos</i>. The plot miscarried and later one of the conspirators
betrayed it. Maria herself, with <b><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius II</a></b>,
presided over the trial at which they were condemned. The four leaders
of the conspiracy were imprisoned in the Great Palace, while others were
set free, went into exile or were secretly executed. The empress' involvement
in the trial is noted by Eustathius as quite inappropriate, while both
Eustathius and Choniates record that it was a 'show' trial and unfairly
conducted. <b><a href="maryp.html">Maria Porphyrogenita </a></b>and Renier
evaded arrest for their part in the plot by fleeing to St Sophia and launching
a full-scale rebellion.<b><a href="#N_45_">[[45]]</a></b>
</p><p><b><a href="maryp.html">Maria Porphyrogenita</a></b>, in this insurrection
against the regime of her step-mother and the <i>protosebastos</i>, had
the support of the patriarch Theodosius, the clergy, and the populace.
When she fled for sanctuary to St Sophia with he husband and supporters,
they were welcomed by the patriarch. This encouraged them to refuse the
offer of an amnesty and to demand the release of their fellow conspirators
and the deposition of the<i> protosebastos</i>. The empress naturally refused
to comply with these demands and <b><a href="maryp.html">Maria Porphyrogenita</a></b>
and Renier turned St Sophia into a fortress and employed foreign mercenaries
in its defence, though the patriarch was not entirely happy with this development.<b><a href="#N_46_">[[46]]</a></b>
The populace enthusiastically supported 'the Caesars', and in their demonstrations
in the hippodrome indulged themselves in violent abuse of the <i>protosebastos</i>
and the empress, both of whom were publicly anathematised by priests.
</p><p>The <i>protosebastos</i> and empress seem to have been reluctant to
mobilise the army against the rebels, but did so when the populace started
plundering the city; unfortunately for the empress's popularity the Latin
inhabitants of the city joined in on the side of her regime.<b><a href="#N_47_">[[47]]</a></b>
The conflict won the name of the 'holy war' because of the regime's threat
to the patriarch Theodosius. According to Eustathius the patriarch was
seized during a visit to the palace to exchange the Easter kiss of peace
with the emperor. The <i>protosebastos</i> had him confined in the monastery
of Christ Pantepoptes and attempted to have him deposed. The empress did
not approve of this action, and the patriarch was released as there were
no convincing charges with which to convict him. However, this aggression
against the patriarch gave <b><a href="maryp.html">Maria Porphyrogenita</a></b>
the opportunity of promoting her cause as a 'holy war' against the pro-Latin
forces of evil.<sup> </sup><b><a href="#N_48_">[[48]]</a></b> Heavy casualties
were to be the result.
</p><p>The 'Caesars', as they were known, were finally driven back into St.
Sophia by the imperial troops at the beginning of May. Warfare within St
Sophia itself was inconceivable, and an amnesty was arranged after negotiations
between the patriarch and the empress. <b><a href="maryp.html">Maria</a></b>
and Renier were allowed to return to the Great Palace.<b><a href="#N_49_">[[49]]</a></b>
But the end result was that the empress had become even more unpopular,
though she deliberately took no measures against the rebels. Shortly afterwards
the patriarch was reinstated with triumphal acclamation (and Eustathius
seems to suggest that until this point numerous rebels were still harboured
in St. Sophia).<b><a href="#N_50_">[[50]]</a></b> However genuine the empress'
clemency, this revolt by her step-daughter had done nothing but increase
the hatred felt towards her regime and westerners in the capital.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><center>
<p><b>An unpopular regime</b></p></center>

<p>Despite the amnesty orchestrated by the patriarch, Eustathius records
that the downfall of the empress was now generally seen as a desirable
contingency. From this point Andronicus Komnenos, <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's</a></b>
cousin, became a focus of the opposition to her regime. Two of Andronicus'
sons had been involved in the attempt to assassinate the<i> protosebastos,</i>
and Andronicus had been invited back from exile both by officials in the
city and by <b><a href="maryp.html">Maria Porphyrogenita</a></b> to take
over the guardianship of the young emperor, on the grounds that his mother
had conducted herself improperly as regent. In May 1181, Andronicus was
joined by his daughter Maria, who could update him on current events.<b><a href="#N_51_">[[51]]</a></b>
Andronicus had also written to the patriarch declaring his loyalty to <b><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius</a></b>.
Indeed Andronicus cleverly argued that he was needed in the capital not
merely because of the threat to the young emperor posed by the <i>protosebastos</i>,
but because of the fact that most inappropriate gossip about the emperor's
mother was circulating throughout the city at all levels.<sup> </sup><b><a href="#N_52_">[[52]]</a></b>
</p><p>With the empress' overthrow openly desired in the city,<b><a href="#N_53_">[[53]])</a></b>Andronicus
encamped across the straits at Chalcedon, and incited the people against
the empress-regent by accusing her of actual conspiracy against her son.
He criticised the empress and the <i>protosebastos</i> for 'corrupting
the purity of the crown' and for insulting the young emperor with their
conduct.<b><a href="#N_54_">[[54]]</a></b> He demanded that the <i>protosebastos</i>
be deposed and Maria retire to a convent, basing his demands on the grounds
that <b><a href="manncom.html">Manuel</a></b> had appointed him as one of
the regents responsible for <b><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius</a></b>.
The commander of the fleet, Andronicus Contostephanus, defected to Andronicus,
and the <i>protosebastos</i> was seized in a palace coup and taken across
the straits to Andronicus and blinded.<b><a href="#N_55_">[[55]]</a></b>
Choniates comments that had he not been such a lethargic weakling, he could
have stopped Andronicus entering the city, but that he lost his nerve.
Maria's regime may also have had some financial problems: she did not get
around to establishing a convent she had planned. This 'house of Ioannitzes'
was later founded by Isaac Angelus.<b><a href="#N_56_">[[56]]</a></b>

organised a massacre of the 'Latins' in the city, on the grounds that empress

the chance of plundering the city. Some 60,000 Latins are said by Eustathius
to have died in the massacre, though the figure must be exaggerated.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_57_">[[57]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">

II</a></b>, we see how <b><a href="andycomn.html">Andronicus</a></b> rose
to become the new regent in Maria-Xene's stead. From <b><a href="andycomn.html">Andronicus'
</a></b>arrival, all the young <b><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius'</a></b>
movements were closely guarded, and no one was allowed to discuss any matter
of state with him. The only obstacle to <b><a href="andycomn.html">Andronicus'</a></b>
seizure of power was now the empress and the decree that stated that she
was to be the head of government until <b><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius
</a></b>turned sixteen. <b><a href="andycomn.html">Andronicus</a></b> forced
the Constantinopolitans to choose between Maria and himself. He threatened
to leave the city because (he declared) the empress was opposed to the
good of the state and conspiring against the emperor. To clear his way
towards the throne, he then had <b><a href="maryp.html">Maria Porphyrogenita</a></b>
and Renier poisoned by their attendants. The main obstacle to the empress'
removal was now the patriarch, and <b><a href="andycomn.html">Andronicus</a></b>
threatened to turn the populace against him unless he cooperated. Theodosius
was compelled to agree in writing to Maria's expulsion from the palace,
and Choniates stresses that had the patriarch not done so he would have
been lynched by the populace at <b><a href="andycomn.html">Andronicus'</a></b>
instigation.<sup> </sup><b><a href="#N_59_">[[59]]</a></b> Theodosius later
resigned in August 1183 over the issue of the marriage of<b><a href="andycomn.html">
Andronicus</a></b>' daughter to <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's</a></b>
illegitimate son, and was replaced by Basil Camaterus and forced to retire
to the island of Terebinthos. <b><a href="andycomn.html">Andronicus</a></b>
by now had totally gained the support of the populace, which Theodosius
had until recently enjoyed.<b><a href="#N_60_">[[60]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b>Maria-Xene's treason and death</b></p></center>

<p>After the murder of <b><a href="maryp.html">Maria Porphyrogenita </a></b>and
Renier, <b><a href="andycomn.html">Andronicus</a></b> then turned on the
empress and demanded that three judges of the velum (Demetrius Tornikes,
Leon Monasteriotes and Constantine Patrenus) prosecute her for treason.
When they first tried to make sure that her son had approved this measure,
<b><a href="andycomn.html">Andronicus</a></b> labelled them supporters of
the <i>protosebastos</i> and they were nearly lynched by the populace.
This shows that Maria, or at least the system of law and order, was still
not without supporters. Furthermore, a conspiracy against <b><a href="andycomn.html">Andronicus</a></b>
included the very Andronicus Contostephanus who had earlier defected to
his side, as well as Basil Camaterus the logothete of the drome, and this
movement attracted many supporters.<b><a href="#N_61_">[[61]]</a></b> The
populace, however, was vehemently opposed to Maria.
</p><p>Maria unwisely attempted to enlist the help of Béla III of Hungary,
who was now her brother-in-law, by writing letters to him suggesting he
ravage the lands around Branichevo and Belgrade to distract <b><a href="andycomn.html">Andronicus'</a></b>
attention from events in the city. This gave <b><a href="andycomn.html">Andronicus</a></b>
the perfect pretext to accuse her of treason and in a show trial she was
was found guilty of treasonable conduct before a court composed of hostile
judges. She was imprisoned in a narrow dungeon near the monastery of St
Diomedes, where she was subjected to ill-treatment and mockery from her
guards. Her son <b><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius</a></b>, who was probably
not yet thirteen years of age, was persuaded to sign the document condemning
her to death.<b><a href="andycomn.html"> Andronicus</a></b> ordered his
son Manuel and a brother-in-law, George, to supervise her execution. Neither
however could countenance this, and the sinister Constantine Tripsychus,
along with the eunuch Pterygeonites who had earlier poisoned <b><a href="maryp.html">Maria
Porphyrogenita</a></b>, was authorised to supervise the deed. As a consequence,
Maria-Xene, perhaps towards the end of 1182, was strangled and buried on
the sea-shore (Eustathius says her body was thrown into the sea). This
left the young emperor vulnerable to attack: after<b><a href="andycomn.html">
Andronicus' </a></b>coronation as co-emperor, <b><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius
II</a></b> was himself strangled with a bowstring, and Choniates tells
us that his corpse was brought to <b><a href="andycomn.html">Andronicus</a></b>,
who kicked it and taunted the emperor's parents, <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel
</a></b>as a liar and Maria as a well-known prostitute. The headless body
of the emperor was finally thrown into the sea encased in a lead coffin.<b><a href="#N_62_">[[62]]</a></b>
<br>&nbsp;
</p><center>
<p>Reactions to Maria's death</p></center>
<i></i>
<p>Maria's execution was generally condemned even by her critics: she was
after all empress and head of the regime until her son came of age. Though
she had not been popular, <b><a href="andycomn.html">Andronicus</a></b>
was obviously afraid of a resurgence of public sympathy for the empress
for he felt it necessary to have all public portraits of her in the capital
repainted to show Maria as a wrinkled old woman to stop passers-by feeling
sorry for her.<b><a href="#N_63_">[[63]])</a></b>It is interesting that
the historians who criticised Maria's conduct considered her murder unacceptable.
Eustathius states that those who committed the crime were later justly
punished for their actions, when <b><a href="andycomn.html">Andronicus</a></b>
deprived them of their reward.<b><a href="#N_64">[[64]]</a></b>&nbsp; choniates
goes further: his brief epitaph for Maria describes her as 'mankind's sweet
light', and he laments both her burial on the seashore and <b><a href="andycomn.html">Andronicus'</a></b>
bloodthirsty exultation at her fate:
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>"And she, who was the sweet light and a vision of beauty unto men, was
buried in obscurity in the sand of the nearby shore (O Sun, who didst look
down on this defilement, and Thou, O Word of God, who art without beginning,
how inscrutable is they forbearance!). The bloodthirsty soul of Andronicus
exulted at this, for with the extermination of Manuel's family, with the
imperial garden laid waste, he would reign as sole monarch over the Roman
empire and hold sway with impunity."<b><a href="#N_65_">[[65]]</a></b>
</p><div><p>Maria was unfortunate at being an attractive young women in the centre
of a predatory crowd of relatives. It was hardly her fault that her hands
were tied in the matter of a second marriage and that her manifold attractions
and position of dynastic power ensured that 'these lovers of hers, as they
themselves would know, set alight and kindled an evil which affected the
whole world'.<b><a href="#N_66_">[[66]]</a></b> Her birth made her vulnerable
to anti-Latin elements in the city and her reliance on Alexios the <i>protosebastos</i>
alienated the rest of the Comnenian family network, all of whom felt they
had as much right to power as he did. She may have felt that it was in
the best interests of the regency to hand over government to the most senior
of her husband's nephews: but, if so, she miscalculated the strength of
the rivalry within the Comnenian family. While ideally suited to the ceremonial
role of the Byzantine empress, she was without the training or ability
to handle the realities of court politics and accordingly was directly
responsible for the downfall of her regime as well as playing a significant
part in the rise to power of <b><a href="andycomn.html">Andronicus I.</a></b></p></div><p><b>Bibliography</b>

Antioch and the hated <i>protosebastos</i>. He was blinded by Andronicus
I Komnenos, though married to his illegitimate daughter, and prior to this
Andronicus, who was greatly attached to him, may have considered making
him his heir over his own son John.
