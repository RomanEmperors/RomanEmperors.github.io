<h3> Sources</h3>















<p>If we except the chroniclers, there are hardly any sources for Theodora that are







written without <em>parti pris.</em> The most important, Procopius of Caesarea, who is our







only source for the lurid details of Theodora's early life, presented a different







Theodora in each of his three works, the <em>History of the Wars of Justinian</em> in seven







books to which an eighth was added later, the <em>Anekdota</em> or <em>Secret History</em>, to give it







its popular name, an essay purportedly written immediately after the first seven







books of the <em>Wars</em> were published and containing data which were too defamatory






to circulate openly, and the <em>De Aedificiis</em> or <em>Buildings</em> which is a panegyric on







<a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> building program throughout the empire. All these works were written or







at least completed after Theodora's death in 548. In the <em>Wars</em>, Procopius credits the







regime's success at suppressing the 'Nika' revolt of 532 to Theodora's courage and







imagines a splendid scene which may have some basis in fact, where she declares







that she, at least, will not flee the capital city. The <em>Anekdota</em> is full of scurrilous







details about Theodora's early life as an actress and courtesan, and her intrigues at







court. In the <em>De Aedificiis,</em> however, the picture is uniformly flattering. The emperor







and empress shared a common piety (1.8.5), he claims, and her loveliness was such







that it was impossible to convey it in words or portray it by a statue (1.11.9). (Even







in the <em>Anekdota</em> 10.11, he concedes that she was attractive, though short and rather







sallow in complexion.)</p>























<p>Procopius' viewpoint differs in these three works, understandably in the <em>De







Aedificiis,</em> which was an encomium and intended to please the emperor, but they do







not actually contradict each other. The lurid details of Theodora's early life find







corroboration of sorts in an unexpected source: the Syriac historian John of Amida,







better known as John of Ephesus (<i>PO</i> 17, i, 188-89) for he became the Monophysite bishop of that city,







refers to Theodora almost casually as "Theodora from the brothel" (<em>ek tou







porneiou)</em>. John is a friendly witness for he looked on Theodora as the protector of







the Monophysites and the fact that the words appear <em>in Greek</em> in his Syriac text may







indicate that he is simply reproducing without malice a sobriquet from the







Constantinople streets. And <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> law code (<em>Codex Justinianus </em>V.4.23)<a href="#N_1_"><b>[[1]]</b></a>







provides another morsel of evidence. This is the law which Procopius<a href="#N_2_"><b>[[2]]</b></a> claims was







promulgated by <a href="justin.html"><b>Justin I</b></a> at <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> instance, in order to legalize the marriage







privileges of a penitent ex-actress. It declares that a former actress who was







admitted to the patriciate would henceforth have all former blemishes wiped out and







was free to marry anyone. Thus we are probably right to consider Procopius a







trustworthy witness for Theodora's early career, albeit a malicious one when he was







writing not for publication.</p>























<p>The death of the emperor <a href="anastasi.html"><b>Anastasius</b></a> in 518 and the accession of <a href="justin.html"><b>Justin I</b></a> marked the







end of a period of tolerance and accommodation for the Monophysite heresy,<a href="#N_3_"><b>[[3]]</b></a> and







the Monophysite monks and churchmen in the eastern provinces faced a tidal wave







of persecution.<a href="#N_4_"><b>[[4]]</b></a> Only Egypt was safe. But Theodora was converted, it seems, to the







Monophysite heresy shortly after the persecution began, and remained a devout







Monophysite until her death and her reputation has been colored by <em>odium







theologicum.</em> When a copy of the <em>Anekdota</em> was found in 1623 in the Vatican







Library, thereby introducing it to the world of scholarship, Catholic churchmen were







delighted to find such explicit proof of the wickedness of the empress, and the







Vatican librarian Alemannus, who was the <em>Anekdota's</em> first editor, remarked that







nothing was too execrable to be believed of this enemy of the Council of







Chalcedon.<a href="#N_5_"><b>[[5]]</b></a> On the other hand, Monophysite sources, mostly in Syriac, laud her







piety and devotion. Theodora and <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> were frequently on opposite sides of the







great theological contention about the Trinity. Yet, both sought common ground, and







<a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> seems never to have doubted the fundamental loyalty of his wife.</p>







<h3>Theodora's Early Life</h3>















<p>The origin of Theodora's family has prompted some speculation: Syria, Cyprus, and







Paphlagonia have all been suggested but we meet her first in Procopius' <em>Anekdota</em> as







the second of three daughters of one Acacius, the bear-keeper for the Green  faction







in the Hippodrome at Constantinople. As such he looked after the trained bears and







other animals for the <em>entr'actes</em> between the chariot races. It was usual for a son to







follow his father in this post, but when Acacius died suddenly, he left no son.







However, his widow remarried quickly and hoped that her new husband would take







over the post of the old one. However the final decision rested with the chief ballet







dancer to make, and he accepted a bribe to appoint another man. Destitute,







Theodora's mother brought her children wearing garlands into the Hippodrome







where the Greens, Blue, Reds and White sat in their reserved sections, and







presented them as suppliants to the crowd. The Greens rejected them. But the Blues







who had just lost their own bear-keeper, took pity and appointed Theodora's







stepfather to the vacant post. Theodora, naturally enough, remained an aficionado of







the Blues. Whatever Theodora's differences might be on theology with <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a>,







they agreed upon what faction to support in the Hippodrome. </p>























<p>As soon as they were old enough, Theodora's mother put her children on the stage.







The eldest, Comito, scored a great success and Theodora, the middle child, followed







her on stage, playing a little slave attendant for her sister. Theater was considered







the embodiment of immorality in the sixth century and by the end of the seventh







century, the Church would succeed in banning it entirely. The staple fare was the mime,







involving obscene burlesque, and on the evidence of Procopius, Theodora made a







name for herself with her portrayal of Leda and the Swan: she stripped off her





clothes as far as the law allowed, for complete nudity was banned, and lay on her







back while some attendants scattered barley on her groin. Then geese, evidently







playing Zeus in several guises, picked up the barley with their bills. She also







entertained notables at banquets and accepted a multitude of lovers. Procopius







pretends that her appetite for sexual intercourse was voracious and relates stories







about her that sound like men's locker room humor, but nonetheless they were







probably tales current on the streets of Constantinople. It is certain that Theodora







had a daughter before her marriage to <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> and Procopius also reports a son,







who presented himself at court, claiming that his father on his deathbed had told him







that the empress was his mother, and whereupon Theodora, having heard his story,







disposed of him. We may reasonably doubt the truth of this tale, for it assumes that







Theodora was unashamed of a bastard daughter, even arranging a good marriage for







her, but was determined that her bastard son be consigned to oblivion. The "son"







may have been an imposter, or, perhaps more likely, the report was complete fiction.</p>























<p>In due course, however, she became the mistress of a Syrian Hecebolus who was a







native of Tyre, and accompanied him when he went to the Libyan  Pentapolis as







governor. For Theodora, this represented an escape from her profession, for a law of







409 (<em>Cod. Just.</em> XI 41.5) barred local authorities from transferring actors from their







cities, thereby lessening the attraction of popular festivals, and if Hecebolus had not







been a man of some standing with "clout", Theodora might have encountered legal







obstacles to her desertion of the stage. But she soon failed to please. Abandoned and







maltreated by Hecebolus (<em>Anek.</em> 9.27; 12.30), she made her way to Alexandria. We







may have an authentic comment from her on Hecebolus years later: in 535 <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a>







issued a constitution (<em>Nov. </em>8.1) which prohibited the purchase of public office, for it







was an inducement to corruption. <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> states explicitly that he consulted







Theodora before he made this reform. She may have had Hecebolus in mind as a







typical public servant, for it is not unlikely that he bought his office and recouped







the purchase price by corrupt practices. But we must not wander too far into the







realm of imagination. </p>























<p>In Alexandria she seems to have met the patriarch, Timothy III, a Monophysite







whose position was powerful enough that he was able to give refuge to Monophysite







churchmen such as Severus, the patriarch of Antioch, when the persecution initiated







by <a href="justin.html"><b>Justin I</b></a> drove them from their sees. At least Monophysite legend had it that she







considered 'Bishop Timothy' her spiritual father, and this 'Timothy' may well have







been Timothy III who became patriarch in 517, one year before <a href="justin.html"><b>Justin I's</b></a>







accession.<a href="#N_6_"><b>[[6]]</b></a> Actresses were normally denied the sacraments until they were on their







deathbeds, and so we cannot tell how Theodora met her bishop, if, in fact, they did







actually meet. But her conversion was sincere and lasting. She remained a devout







Monophysite until her death.</p>















<p alin="left">From Alexandria she went to Antioch and there she was befriended by the Blue







faction's star ballet dancer, Macedonia, who also, it appears, had a second







occupation as an informer of <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a>, who was now, after Vitalian's death, the







<em>magister militum praesentalis </em>in Constantinople. Macedonia passed on to her







patron the names of notables who represented a threat to him. Procopius (<em>Anek.</em>12.29-32) relates a fantastic tale that Theodora revealed to Macedonia a dream which







she had, that she would come to the capital where the Lord of the Demons would







bed her, marry her and make her mistress of limitless wealth.  How a confidence like







that can have increased Macedonia's faith in Theodora is hard to understand. But it







may have been Macedonia who provided Theodora with an introduction to







<a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a>.<a href="#N_7_"><b>[[7]]</b></a> Possibly she presented Theodora to him as a person whom it would be







useful to know, and as a fellow aficionado of the Blues. In any case the two met, fell in







love, and what is more remarkable, accepted each other as intellectual equals. They







were always more than sexual partners. A tradition of the eleventh century relates







that on Theodora's return to the capital, she lived in humble lodgings and spun wool,







which was a virtuous occupation. She did not forget her erstwhile associates but







there was no question of her returning to her former life. If <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> wanted her, he







had to marry her.</p>







<p>For that, new legislation would be  necessary, for the laws forbade a patrician to marry an







actress. <a href="justin.html"><b>Justin</b></a>, who seems to have been fond of Theodora was willing to oblige, but







<a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> encountered an unexpected obstacle in the empress Euphemia. <a href="justin.html"><b>Justin</b></a> had







bought his wife as a slave many years before he became emperor, and her slave-name <a href="euphem.html"><b>Lupicina</b></a> rouses suspicion for it was commonly found among prostitutes. Yet







once she became empress, she took the more respectable name of<a href="euphem.html"><b> Euphemia</b></a>, and







guarded the respectability of her office jealously. She liked <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a>, and ordinarily







refused him nothing, but she would not hear of him marrying an actress. But once







she was dead (ca. 523), <a href="justin.html"><b>Justin</b></a> promulgated the necessary legislation and it appears







in the Justinianic Code (<em>Cod. Just. </em>V.4.23)<em>.</em> It freed truly penitent actresses from all







blemishes and returned them to their pristine condition. Soon after, the patriarch







Epiphanius joined <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> and Theodora in wedlock in the cathedral church of the







Holy Wisdom. </p>















<p>Thus the new dynastic family in Constantinople was sprung from a union of Illyrian







(or perhaps Thracian) peasant stock from the Balkans on the one side and the theater







on the other. This was a society which was remarkably mobile in spite of its







apparently rigid class structure. <a href="justin.html"><b>Justin</b></a> had used his good fortune to further his







family's status: he had brought <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a>, the son of his sister, to Constantinople,







seen to his education and adopted him (the name <em>Justinianus</em> is the cognomen which







Justinian took upon adoption: his birth name was Flavius Petrus Sabbatius), and he







was only slightly less generous to another nephew, Germanus, a brilliant army







officer who made a splendid marriage into the Constantinopolitan branch of the







aristocratic Anicii. Theodora also provided an entrée for her friends from the theater.







Her sister, Comito, became the wife of a rising young officer, Sittas, who was to die







young while campaigning in Armenia. Her niece married the nephew of <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a>,







<a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin II</b></a>, who succeeded <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> in 565. These two <em>parvenus</em> on the throne would







have been only human if they took some satisfaction from the sight of scions of







Constantinople's great families bowing and scraping before them. Theodora in







particular was punctilious about court ceremonial. Procopius (<em>Anek. </em>30.23-6)







complains that <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> <em>and Theodora</em> made all senators, including patricians,







prostrate themselves before them whenever they entered their presence, and made it







clear that their relations with the civil militia were those of masters and slaves. With







his next breath Procopius complains that the emperor and empress made their







magistrates dance attendance upon them,  and made a point of supervising them







carefully, whereas previously magistrates had a greater degree of independence and







could get on with their work. What Procopius fails to add is that these magistrates







used their independence to enrich themselves and that one reason for the







dissatisfaction with the regime, which both Procopius and John Lydus express, is







that it tried, with no marked success, to wipe out bureaucratic corruption.<a href="#N_8_"><b>[[8]]</b></a></p>







<h3>Theodora as a partner in power</h3>







<p>Procopius in his <em>Anekdota</em> indicates that what attracted <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> to Theodora was







pure, undiluted lust. They did, we can be sure, marry for love and they hoped for







children. When Mar Saba, the stoutly Chalcedonian archimandrite of the lauras in







the Judean desert, came to Constantinople in 531 with a petition on behalf of the







Palestinians who had suffered in the Samaritan revolt, Theodora asked for his







prayers that she might conceive, but the old monk refused, saying that the son she bore







would be a greater calamity for the empire than the old Monophysite emperor







<a href="anastasi.html"><b>Anastasius</b></a>! Theodora never did conceive. The daughter born to an unknown father







before her marriage is the only child that was certainly hers.</p>







<p>She had <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> ear while he was still the heir-in-waiting, but it was the 'Nika'







revolt which demonstrated her steel. A riot early in 532 rapidly escalated into a full-scale revolt which almost toppled the regime. Procopius (<em>Wars</em> 1.24.33-37)







describes the panicky debate in the palace whether to flee in their ships or to stay







where they were. Then Theodora rose to speak. Her speech, which is a nice piece of







rhetoric, balances a speech made by a senator to the insurgents, advising cautious







action against the emperor. Theodora begins with the acknowlegement that urging







acts of daring was not considered womanly but nonetheless she took a tough line







and urged defiance. Her husband might flee if he wished, but she would stay, for she






liked the ancient maxim which said that royalty made a good shroud. The ancient







maxim had actually said that <em>tyranny</em> made a good shroud, and Procopius' art may







have enhanced Theodora's great scene. We cannot take it at face value, even though







Procopius may have been present at the time and witnessed it. But <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> whose







hesitation up until this point had if anything made the situation worse, recovered his







nerve and took the offensive. He ordered his loyal troops led by two reliable







officers, Belisarius and the Gepid prince Mundo, to attack the demonstrators in the







Hippodrome. The resulting massacre would make Tiananmen Square look like a







very minuscule atrocity indeed.</p>







<p>Theodora knew how to be ruthless and no one should sentimentalize her. One







source<a href="#N_9_"><b>[[9]]</b></a> for the 'Nika' revolt reports that <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> might have shown compassion







for the nephews of <a href="anastasi.html"><b>Anastasius</b></a>, Pompeius and Hypatius, the latter of whom the mob







had chosen as their replacement for <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a>, but Theodora did not approve of







mercy where the security of the regime was in question. It was her will that







Pompeius and Hypatius be put to death. <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> might later restore their property







to their heirs, but by then they were no danger to the regime.</p>







<p> Theodora enjoyed the perquisites of imperial power, and her marriage with







<a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a>, which seems to have been a union of mutual respect, was so unusual by







contemporary standards that it provoked reactions which reveal as much about the







mind-set of the times as about the married couple. The reader of Procopius'







appraisal of Theodora (<em>Anek. </em>10) will find a mother lode of clues to the group







psychology of the small cadre of bureaucrats who ran the empire and for whom







Theodora represented a center of power that did not fit their notional horizons.







'Those who believe that the female mind is totally depraved by the loss of chastity,







will eagerly listen to all the invectives of private envy or popular resentment, which







have dissembled the virtues of Theodora, exaggerated her vices, and condemned







with rigour the venal and voluntary sins of the youthful harlot,' wrote Edward







Gibbon.<a href="#N_10_"><b>[[10]]</b></a>  Gibbon, who never failed to relish 'venal and voluntary sins',







particularly those practised by women, mentions a selection of Theodora's,







excerpted for the most part from the <em>Anekdota</em>: her 'private hours were devoted to







the prudent as well as the grateful care of her beauty,' the 'most illustrious







personages of the state' who sought audiences, were kept waiting and then 'they







experienced, as her humour might suggest, the silent arrogance of an empress, or the







capricious levity of a comedian.' He notes her 'immense avarice' to secure great







wealth which might be excused by the fact that her good fortune depended entirely







upon <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> longevity and if he were to die before her, she could retain her







status only with her private assets. 'But the reproach of cruelty, so repugnant even to







her softer vices, has left an indelible stain on the memory of Theodora,' added







Gibbon, and he proceeded to give examples. They come from the <em>Anekdota, </em>and







Procopius' chief criterion for including them in that 'satire', as Gibbon called it, was







that they should be malicious. Yet Theodora never shared her husband's reputation







for being easy-going. </p>






<p>She presented herself, however, as the friend of the unfortunate. The great inscription







on the entablature of the church of Sts. Sergius and Bacchus in Constantinople







proclaims her as the 'God-crowned Theodora whose mind is adorned with piety and







whose constant toil lies in unsparing efforts to nourish the destitute.'<a href="#N_11_"><b>[[11]]</b></a> She shut







down brothels in the capital and removed the prostitutes to a convent on the Asian







side of the Dardanelles called the <em>Metanoia</em> (Repentance).<a href="#N_12_"><b>[[12]]</b></a> She intervened on







behalf of women who were wronged.<a href="#N_13_"><b>[[13]]</b></a> And there is a clutch of legislation







promulgated by <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> which improves the status of women and where we may







suspect Theodora's influence.</p>







<p>It may be argued that these reforms merely mark the culmination of a trend which







had been taking place over the previous centuries, but nonetheless they belong to







<a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> and if he could consult his wife about administrative corruption, which he







indicates that he did, it seems likely that he would seek her input on legislation







affecting women's rights, too.  <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> forbade exposure of unwanted infants, who







were far more frequently girls than boys, though apparently he failed to put a stop to







the custom, for in 529 we find a new law which gave anyone who rescued an







exposed child the right to give him/her either free or slave status.<a href="#N_14_"><b>[[14]]</b></a> The laws







concerning <em>tutela</em> (guardianship) of women had undergone modification since the







days of the Roman Republic when women remained under lifetime <em>tutela</em>: women







were still excluded from acting as guardians in the third century, but in 390, widows







were allowed to be guardians of their children and grandchildren if they did not







remarry and if there were no other legitimate male guardians. <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> extended the







right of guardianship to the natural mother.<a href="#N_15_"><b>[[15]]</b></a> He eased the punishments for







adultery: in <em>Novel </em>117.15 he reminded his subjects that while a husband might kill







his wife's lover with impunity, he might not kill his wife and, for that matter, before







he killed the lover, he must send him three written warnings, duly witnessed!<a href="#N_16_"><b>[[16]]</b></a> A







woman should not be put into prison where male guards might violate her; if







detention was necessary she could go to a nunnery. A woman's right to hold







property, he ruled, should be no less than a man's. And the ante-nuptial donation,







which had developed in Late Antiquity as a counter-dowry given by the husband to







his wife, should be equal in value to the dowry.<a href="#N_17_"><b>[[17]]</b></a> 







<a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> measures protecting







women give us ground for suspecting Theodora's counsel and influence, and, from







their dates, it is clear that her influence did not end with her death.</p>







<p>Within the civil and military <em>militia</em>, Theodora created her own centers of power.







The eunuch Narses who in old age developed into a brilliant general, was her







protégé. So was the praetorian prefect Peter Barsymes. John the Cappadocian she







identified as an enemy. He was <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> efficiency expert and both Procopius and







John the Lydian bear witness to his unpopularity. He was sacrificed to the mob







during the 'Nika' revolt but he was soon back at his former post as praetorian







prefect. But he paid Theodora scant respect, and even worse from her viewpoint, he







had <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> ear. Theodora was jealous of his influence and with the help of her







friends, particularly her crony, Antonina, the wife of Belisarius, she set a trap for







him and he fell into it. The bait she used was the prospect of imperial power. On her







instructions, Antonina intimated to John's naïve daughter that Belisarius was







unhappy and ready to rebel, and that he would welcome John as a fellow







conspirator. This proposition involved disloyalty, but Theodora had assessed her







victim correctly. John did not balk at disloyalty to the emperor when the reward was







power. Even after John had fallen, Theodora's vengeance followed him. Officers of







the civil and military <em>militia</em> learned that if they carried out <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> commands







negligently, he might be angry but he would eventually forgive them. But let them







flout Theodora and they could expect condign retribution and no forgiveness.</p>







<h3>Theodora's Religious Policy</h3>







<p>In the <em>Menelogion</em> (Liturgical Calendar) of the Greek Orthodox Church, under







November 14 there appears "The Assumption of the Orthodox King Justinian and







the memory of Queen Theodora". Theodora was not orthodox and contemporary







orthodox churchmen recognized her as an enemy. Yet religious differences never







seem to have caused a rift between Justinian and Theodora, and Procopius (<em>Anek.</em>







10.15; 27.13) may be expressing the view of his class in Constantinople when he







reports that the "rift" was a hoax devised by this evil pair to encourage strife among







the Christians.  </p>







<p>The Arabic <em>History of the Patriarchs of the Coptic Church of Alexandria</em> is better







taken as a document of Monophysite folk tradition than as an accurate record of







events: it overlooks <a href="justin.html"><b>Justin I</b></a> entirely, for instance, and attributes the persecution of







the Monophysites that began with <a href="justin.html"><b>Justin's</b></a> accession to <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> and regards







Theodora not only as defender of Monophysite churchmen but also as an emigrant







from Alexandria herself.<a href="#N_18_"><b>[[18]]</b></a> Severus, who had been a protégé of the old emperor







<a href="anastasi.html"><b>Anastasius</b></a>, had to flee to Egypt, as did many other Monophysite churchmen and







monks: in fact, Alexandria became a crucible for the various strands of Monophysite







theology, and Severus' beliefs were rapidly challenged there by radical sectarians







who made him appear a relative moderate.  Theodora may have met Severus in







Alexandria. She was still only a reformed actress, but her encounter with







Monophysite refugees had important results.</p>







<p>She was soon in a better position to help. Severus' Chalcedonian successor in







Antioch, Paul 'the Jew' (519-21), undertook a cleansing







 of the churches and monasteries of the Orient. The fragments of John of Ephesus'







<em>Ecclesiastical History</em><a href="#N_19_"><b>[[19]]</b></a> supply a vivid record from the perspective of the







persecuted. Monks and nuns were driven from their monasteries and some had to







spend their nights like wild beasts wandering on the hillsides, enduring snow and







winter rains in the winter. Paul's tenure was short but his successor as patriarch,







Euphrasius, was moderate only by comparison. He perished in the earthquake which







befell Antioch in 526, and Monophysite tradition had no doubt that his death was







not only hideous, but appropriate. His successor, Ephraim of Amida, had been a







military officer, a former <em>Magister Militum per Orientem,</em> and he did not hesitate to







use military force.</p>







<p>During all this time Theodora's influence at court grew. But <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> was not yet







emperor, and, dependent as he was on his nephew, <a href="justin.html"><b>Justin</b></a> clearly did not want to be







hurried. In 526 Pope John visited Constantinople where he went through a







coronation ceremony with <a href="justin.html"><b>Justin</b></a>, but not <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a>. But within a few months,







<a href="justin.html"><b>Justin's</b></a> health was clearly failing, and on 1 April, 527, he crowned <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> as his







co-emperor, and four months later, he died. The Monophysites now had a sturdy







friend at the center of power. Theodora did what she could. When the monks of the







monastery called 'Orientalium' at Edessa were expelled in the dead of winter by







their Chalcedonian bishop, they wandered from place to place until they found







refuge for between six and seven years at a monastery called En-Hailaf, and then







Theodora arranged for their return home. Mare, the deposed metropolitan of Amida,







and his clergy nearly perished in exile at Petra until Theodora got permission from







<a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> for them to go to Alexandria and, when Mare died, it was Theodora who







arranged for his bones to be returned to Amida.<a href="#N_20_"><b>[[20]]</b></a></p>







<p>Her influence in religious affairs reached its height in the early 530s. By 531, it was







clear even to a convinced orthodox theologian like <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> that <a href="justin.html"><b>Justin's</b></a> harsh







measures against heresy had failed. In Antioch, the persecutions of the Chalcedonian







patriarch Ephraim had provoked a violent revolt.<a href="#N_21_"><b>[[21]]</b></a> At summer's end, the







persecution was suspended and eight Monophysite bishops were invited to







Constantinople. Early in the next year, the regime survived the 'Nika' revolt and







Theodora emerged from it with greater influence than before. When the bishops







arrived, accompanied by a mini-mob of not less than five hundred holy men,<a href="#N_22_"><b>[[22]]</b></a>







Theodora welcomed them and housed them in the Hormisdas Palace adjoining the







Great Palace which had been <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> and Theodora's own dwelling before they







became emperor and empress. Theodora visited them every two or three days,







sometimes bringing <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> with her, and the church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus







was built for Monophysite use. </p>







<p>In the spring of 532, while construction crews were repairing the devastation of the







'Nika' revolt in Constantinople, <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> sponsored a three-day conference of







bishops in the Hormisdas Palace. Five bishops debated on each side. But the 'Tome'







of Leo proved the sticking-point. In the spring of the next year, <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> published







his own confession of faith: a Chalcedonian-flavored declaration which managed to







avoid mention of the 'Tome' of Leo. Then Theodora and Justinian invited Severus to







the capital, and in the winter of 534-5, Severus came, though without enthusiasm.<a href="#N_23_"><b>[[23]]</b></a>







Upon his arrival, Theodora introduced him to the new patriarch Anthimus, who had







been appointed to the see of Constantinople upon the death of Epiphanius in







535.Theodora may have known that Anthimus was not unsympathetic to







Monophysite views but, if so, she kept her information secret. As far as anyone else







knew, his orthodox credentials were impeccable.<a href="#N_24_"><b>[[24]]</b></a>  Yet, when Severus and







Anthimus met, the latter was soon won over. In Rome, Pope John II was not a hard-line prelate. A solution must have seemed just around the corner and Theodora







could take much of the credit for it.</p>





<p>Then suddenly it fell apart. In Egypt, Timothy III died, and Theodora enlisted the







help of Dioscoros the Augustal Prefect and Aristomachos the duke of Egypt to







facilitate the enthronement of a disciple of Severus, Theodosius, thereby







outmaneuvering her husband who had been plotting for a Catholic successor as







patriarch. But on the very day that Theodosius was installed, a violent uprising







organized by the extreme Monophysites, the Aphthartodocetists, drove him from







Alexandria and invested in his place the Aphthartodocetist archdeacon Gaianas, who







held the patriarchate for 103 days, until imperial troops, led by Narses, acting under







Theodora's orders with which <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> acquiesced, replaced Theodosius on his







episcopal throne. Severus, whose theology Theodosius shared, now belonged to the







moderate Monophysite party, outnumbered in Egypt by the Aphthartodocetists a.k.a.







Julianists a.k.a Gaianists, who were disciples of Julian of Halicarnassus, an







erstwhile friend of Severus who had been his companion in exile, where he carried







Monophysite doctrine to the extreme that he claimed Christ's body was







incorruptible. Gaianas was consigned to exile in Sardinia but his theology swept







Egypt.</p>







<p>In Rome, Pope John II died and his successor Agapetus arrived in Constantinople in







536 on a mission for the Ostrogothic king, Theodahad. Agapetus had a high card:







Belisarius' campaign to recover Italy from the Ostrogoths was just getting under







way and <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> could not appear as an opponent of the Chalcedonians without







alienating the support and good will of the Italians. Shortly after his arrival on 1







March, Agapetus denounced Anthimus and on 13 March, Anthimus was deposed







and replaced by the solidly Chalcedonian Menas, director of the hospice of







Sampson. On 22 April, Agapetus died, but a synod presided over by Menas







excommunicated Anthimus, Severus and their followers and on 6 August, the







emperor confirmed the excommunication and directed that neither of the two







heretical prelates should live in any of the great cities of the empire; rather they







should dwell in isolation and the works of Severus should be burned. But with







Theodora's help, Severus returned safely to Egypt where he died in 538, and







Anthimus disappeared. After Theodora's death in 548, he was discovered living







quietly in the women's quarters of the palace which were Theodora's domain.   </p>







<p>She soon received another patriarchal refugee, Theodosius I. Even with the help of







imperial troops, he could not hold his ground in Alexandria against the Julianists.







Word was brought to Theodora and she (according to the <em>History of the Patriarchs







of the Coptic Church</em>) "calmly, wisely and humbly, went in to the prince and







informed him of all that had happened, without his sanction, to Father Theodosius,







patriarch in the city of Alexandria," and <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> gave Theodora the power to do







what was necessary. So an investigation was held into the disputed ordinations of







Theodosius and his Julianist rival, Gaianas, and Theodosius was vindicated. But for







all <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> could do, Theodosius would not accept the creed of Chalcedon even







though <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> brought him to Constantinople and argued the matter with him on







six occasions. So <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> deposed him and exiled him together with 300







Monophysites to the fortress of Derkos in Thrace. Theodora soon came to his







rescue, however, and brought him back to the relative comfort of the Hormisdas







Palace where he lived under her protection, and after her death in 548, under







<a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a>, for on her deathbed Theodora had <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> swear that he would protect







her little community of Monophysite refugees there, and he kept his promise.  </p>







<p>Pope Agapetus died in Constantinople before he could return to Italy. Theodora's







choice as his successor was a deacon who had accompanied Agapetus to







Constantinople, Vigilius, who had apparently intimated that he was prepared to be







more malleable. But the election was held before Vigilius could reach Rome, and the







new pope was the son of Pope Hormisdas, Silverius, who had the support of the







Ostrogothic king Theodahad. Events were moving rapidly in Italy: Belisarius, leading







an imperial invasion force, was advancing from the south, Naples fell, and the







Ostrogoths, disgusted with Theodahad's flaccid leadership, deposed him and







replaced him with Witigis. He decided that his best strategy would be to secure his







northern frontier against the Franks before he attended to the Byzantines, and he







evacuated Rome, having first received a loyalty oath from Silverius.  Once the Goths







had departed, Silverius invited the Byzantine forces into the city. That might have







given him some claim for consideration. But for Theodora he was only an







impediment to her theological strategy.</p>







<p>Procopius (<em>Wars</em> 5.25. 13-14) mentions briefly that Belisarius deposed Silverius







under suspicion of treason and sent him to Greece and the <em>Anekdota</em> (1.14) promises







to describe Theodora's skullduggery, but it is an unfulfilled promise.  However, the







<em>Liber Pontificalis</em> describes how Silverius refused Theodora's demand that he







remove the anathema of Agapetus from Anthimus, and when he refused, she sent







Belisarius instructions to find a pretext to remove him. Belisarius and his wife







Antonina saw to it that Silverius was deposed, and Vigilius appointed in his stead.







Theodora now had her man on the papal throne but as it turned out, he was not







malleable enough.</p>







<p>The next incident in the saga of <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> continuing effort to find common ground







for the Chalcedonians and Monophysites was the 'Three Chapters' dispute. It arose







from an effort to clear the Chalcedonians of any suspicion of Nestorianism by







condemning the teaching of three long-dead theologians and it gave rise to a







protracted struggle which pitted the churches of Italy and Africa against







Constantinople. Ironically, for the Monophysites the dispute was largely irrelevant.







Vigilius waged an epic struggle with <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> and eventually lost, but in the







process, the 'Three Chapters' incident revealed the gulf that was widening between







East and West. Vigilius was not an unyielding prelate but he knew that if he







compromised, Italy and Africa would disown him, which in fact, did happen when







he did, in the end, surrender. The pope in the sixth century was anything but an







absolute potentate in matters of faith. Theodora died while the dispute was still







raging. But before she died she made a last contribution to the growing schism in







Christendom.</p>







<p>In 541, al-Harith, the sheikh of the Ghassanid tribe of Saracens whose friendship







was important for the security of the south Syrian frontier, was in Constantinople on







other business and took the opportunity to approach Theodora with a request for







bishops. Imperial prestige in the east was low at this point. Only the year before, the







Persians had sacked Antioch. With Theodora's blessing, Theodosius, who from his







refuge in the Hormisdas Palace was now recognized as the spiritual leader of the







Monophysites, ordained two monks as nomadic bishops. Nominally Jacob







Baradaeus was metropolitan of Edessa and Theodore was metropolitan of Bostra but







neither resided in their episcopal seats where they might have been vulnerable to arrest.







Instead they moved from camp to camp, in the countryside beyond the reach of the







Chalcedonian hierarchy.</p>







<p>Theodosius himself had been reluctant to ordain Monophysite bishops for he was







well aware that, with the establishment of a separate Monophysite hierarchy,







Christendom would be permanently split in two. That would strike at the heart of







imperial unity, and the moderate Monophysites were still steadfastly loyal. But







Jacob Baradaeus had no such scruples. His <em>Life</em>, attributed to John of Ephesus,







relates how he came to Constantinople, and met Theodora who had already seen







him in a dream and was given a dwelling by her where he met a large number of the







faithful, among them the Ghassanid sheikh, al-Harith. Once he was consecrated







bishop at al-Harith's request, he secretly secured permission from Theodosius to







ordain priests and the <em>Life</em><a href="#N_25_"><b>[[25]]</b></a> says with some exaggeration that he ordained 100,000.







<a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> tried to arrest him but he was never caught and in the end, he gave up.







Baradaeus has a good claim to be the founder of the Monophysite church.</p>







<p>The final result of Theodora's policy on theological matters was separatist. The split







between Chalcedonian and Monophysite doctrines was probably insoluble, for







behind both were popular forces which could not be controlled by theological







formulas. The 'Tome' of Pope Leo, which was the core of the Chalcedonian Creed,







was a reef on which all formulas would founder, for the Catholics would not accept







any amendment to it, whereas even the most moderate Monophysite had come to







regard it as an evil doctrine. One could argue, as the Chalcedonians did, that







Theodora fostered heresy and thus undermined the unity of Christendom. But it







would be equally fair to say that it was the non-negotiable position taken by Rome







that undermined unity, and that Theodora's championship of the Monophysites







delayed the alienation of the eastern church, and might have postponed it indefinitely







but for external events she could not control or foresee. </p>







<p>Yet, one incident shows how far Theodora could go to thwart her husband on







religious matters.  The Nobadae south of Egypt were converted to Monophysite







Christianity about 540. <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> had been determined that they be converted to the







Chalcedonian faith and Theodora equally determined that they should be







Monophysites. So <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> made arrangements for Chalcedonian missionaries from







the Thebaid should go with presents to Silko the king of the Nobadae. But on







hearing this, Theodora prepared her own missionaries and wrote to the duke of the







Thebaid that he should delay her husband's embassy so that the Monophysite







missionaries should arrive first; otherwise he would pay for it with his life. The duke







was canny enough not to thwart Theodora and thus he saw to it that the







Chalcedonian missionaries were delayed, and when they reached Silko, they were sent







away, for the Nobadae had already adopted the creed of Theodosius.<a href="#N_26_"><b>[[26]]</b></a></p>







<p>At the end of his life <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> converted to Monophysitism himself, and he did not







choose the moderate Monophysitism of Theodosius who still lived in the Hormisdas







Palace, but the extreme form taught by Julian of Halicarnassus. Theodora was by







then long dead. She had died of cancer in 548 and though it has been argued that the







sole source for her illness, Victor of Tonnena, may not use the word "cancer" in its







modern medical sense, yet cancer, possibly breast cancer, seems to  be best guess.







Perhaps Theodora's long discussions and debates with her husband (both were no







mean theologians) on the nature of the Trinity had, in the end, convinced <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a>.







She was a remarkable woman who left her mark on her age. How she should be







ranked for statecraft remains an open question.</p>
