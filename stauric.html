<h3>
Stauracius (A. D. 811)</h3></center>

<center><b>Matthew Marsh</b>
<br>Sul Ross State University</center>

<div><p>Reigning only two months following the annihilation
of the imperial army under <b><a href="nickkie.html">Nicephorus I </a></b>in
Bulgaria, Stauracius has one of the shortest reigns in the history of the
Byzantine Empire.&nbsp; We possess very little information about the life
or reign of Stauracius.&nbsp; What little information we have comes from
Theophanes, the main chronicler of the period, whose hatred of <b><a href="nickkie.html">Nicephorus</a></b>
has led Stauracius to have a similarly negative portrayal to that of his
father in Theophanes  <i>Chronographia</i>.<b><a href="#_edn1">[[1]]</a></b>The
account in Theophanes is slightly supplemented by short references in other
literary sources of the period, but these tend to be very short, basic
and, particularly in the Syriac works, wrong<b>.<a href="#_edn2">[[2]]</a></b>Because
of this Stauracius remains a rather shadowy figure in the history of the
period.
</p></div><center>
<p><b><u>Early Life</u></b></p></center>


<p>Stauracius was the son of the Emperor <b><a href="nickkie.html">Nicephorus
I</a></b> and his wife Procopia and was born sometime in the early 790s,
possibly in the same time period that <b><a href="nikkie.html">Nicephorus</a></b>
became <b><a href="irene.html">Irene s </a></b>Chief<i> Logotheate</i> in
charge of finance for the empire<b>.<a href="#_edn3">[[3]]</a> </b>Stauracius
was approximately 10-12 years old when <b><a href="nickkie.html">Nicephorus
</a></b>launched
his successful <i>coup d état</i> in A.D. 802<b>.<a href="#_edn4">[[4]]</a></b>At
first he would have no official position in his father s government until,
during the late summer of A.D. 803, the rebellion of Bardanes Turcus broke
out in the Anatoliac theme.<b><a href="#_edn5">[[5]]</a>&nbsp; </b>While
Turcus s rebellion failed by early September, <b><a href="nickkie.html">Nicephorus</a></b>
decided to move quickly to make his hold on the throne more secure.&nbsp;
To this end <b><a href="nickkie.html">Nicephorus</a></b> had Stauracius
crowned as co-emperor on Christmas Day A.D. 803.<b><a href="#_edn6">[[6]]
</a></b>While
Stauracius would not take an active part in <b><a href="nickkie.html">Nicephorus s</a></b>
government at this time, his coronation would end any questions about the
succession and make it harder for any potential usurper to gain the throne.
<br>&nbsp;

</p><p>There is then no mention of Stauracius until A.D.
807, at which time <b><a href="nickkie.html">Nicephorus,</a></b> having
decided that his son needed to be married, held an imperial bride show
in order to pick a wife for his son.&nbsp; On December 20<sup>th</sup><b><a href="nickkie.html">Nicephorus</a></b>
chose Theophano, a relative of the late Empress <b><a href="irene.html">Irene,</a></b>
to marry Stauracius.&nbsp; Theophano was chosen in spite of the fact that,
according to Theophanes, she was engaged to another man whom she had already
slept with and she was not the most beautiful of those in the show<b>.<a href="#_edn7">[[7]]</a></b>
<br>&nbsp;

</p><div><p>Stauracius does not appear again in the historical
record until the launch of <b><a href="nickkie.html">Nicephorus s</a></b>
ill-fated Bulgarian campaign in May of A.D. 811.<a href="#_edn8">[[8]]</a>&nbsp;
The Bulgars had been a major foreign policy concern of <b>t</b>he Empire
since the days of <b><a href="Constiv.html">Constantine IV</a></b>, whose
campaign against them ended disastrously, and between A.D. 808 - 811 the
simmering hostilities between the two powers had erupted into open warfare.<b><a href="#_edn9">[[9]]</a>

<a href="nickkie.html">Nicephorus</a></b> led the campaign in person with
Stauracius, <b><a href="mikeI.html">Michael I Rhangabe</a></b>, his son-in-law
[and a future emperor], and a large collection of senior dignitaries from
the Imperial court in tow.&nbsp; The campaign was initially very successful
as the army struck at the Bulgarian capital Pliska, overwhelmed its 12,000-strong
garrison and then defeated an army of some 15,000 the Bulgarian Khan Krum
had sent to relieve the city<b><a href="#_edn10">[[10]]&nbsp;</a> </b>In
his messages back to Constantinople <b><a href="nickkie.html">Nicephorus</a></b>
attributed victory to the military advice of Stauracius.<b><a href="#_edn11">[[11]</a>]

</b>However, on the return march a desperate Krum trapped the Byzantine
army in a small valley with palisades and two days later launched a massive
attack.&nbsp; In the ensuing battle <b><a href="nickkie.html">Nicephorus
</a></b>was
killed and most of the army cut to pieces.<a href="#_edn12">[[12]]</a>&nbsp;
Stauracius suffered a grievous wound to the spine, but was evacuated successfully
from the battlefield to Adrianople<b>.<a href="#_edn13">[[13]]</a></b></p></div><center>
<p><b><u>Reign and Death</u></b></p></center>


<p>Roughly three days after the battle the main survivors
had been gathered at Adrianople.&nbsp; While Stauracius was by law <b><a href="nickkie.html">Nicephorus s</a></b>
heir, the severity of his injury meant that the succession was in doubt.&nbsp;
Some of the officials pressed <b><a href="mikeI.html">Michael Rhangabe</a></b>,
Stauracius s brother-in-law who had escaped the battle unscathed, to let
them proclaim him emperor.&nbsp; <b><a href="mikeI.html">Rhangabe</a></b>
refused and Stauracius received the support of the senior surviving military
commander, Stephan, the domestic of the scholae.<a href="#_edn14">[[14]]&nbsp;</a>
Stauracius was just strong enough to be able to address the surviving troops
and spoke out against <b><a href="nickkie.html">Nicephorus s </a></b>judgment.&nbsp;
The army then acclaimed him as emperor, on or about July 28<b>.<a href="#_edn15">[[15]]</a></b>

</p><p>By the time Stauracius returned to Constantinople
by litter he found that there was blood in his urine and that he was paralyzed
from the waist down.&nbsp; Though Stauracius did what he could to assert
his authority, rebuffing the Patriarch Nicephorus in his attempt to get
the Emperor to return the large sums of money that the Emperor <b><a href="nickkie.html">Nicephorus</a></b>
had collected, as his condition became known to the officials around him
it became a question of not if he would die, but only when.&nbsp; Stauracius
and Theophano did not have any children of their own so the question of
the succession became the burning question of the day.

</p><p>Stauracius s sister Procopia backed her husband <b><a href="mikeI.html">Michael
Rhangabe</a></b>, but Theophano, attempting to follow in the Empress <b><a href="irene.html">Irene s</a></b>
footsteps, wanted to succeed him as a ruling Empress.&nbsp; Fearing the
possibility of mob violence as his health deteriorated Stauracius finally
decided to make Theophano his successor<b>.<a href="#_edn16">[[16]]</a>

</b>This decision succeeded in uniting the chief officials of the Empire,
in spite of their major differences, as none wanted the uncertainty that
had accompanied<b><a href="irene.html"> Irene </a></b>when she ruled.&nbsp;
The Patriarch Nicephorus, the domestic of the Scholae Stephan and the magister
Theoctistus agreed to back Stauracius s brother-in-law <b><a href="mikeI.html">Michael
Rhangabe</a></b> as Emperor.
<br>&nbsp;

</p><p>On the night of October 1<sup>st</sup> Stauracius,
perhaps getting wind of part of the plot, summoned the domestic Stephan
and asked him if it were possible to have <b><a href="mikeI.html">Michael</a></b>
brought to the palace and blinded.&nbsp; Stephan convinced him that <b><a href="mikeI.html">Michael</a></b>
was too well defended to attempt such an act.&nbsp; After promising Stauracius
to tell no one of their conversation Stephan proceeded to assemble what
was left of the tagmatic troops and key civil servants in the Hippodrome.&nbsp;
There at dawn on October 2<sup>nd</sup> <b><a href="mikeI.html">Michael
Rhangabe</a></b> was proclaimed the new Empero<b>r.<a href="#_edn17">[[17]]</a>

</b>Hearing the acclamation from the palace Stauracius immediately realized
what had happened and summoned his kinsman Symon and accepted tonsure and
the monk s habit.&nbsp; He also sent a strong protest to the Patriarch
Nicephorus over his role in the <i>coup d état</i> that the Patriarch
answered in person, along with <b><a href="mikeI.html">Michael I Rhangabe</a></b>
and his wife.&nbsp; The patriarch counseled Stauracius that they had acted
thus not out of treachery, but out of fear for his life.&nbsp; Stauracius,
unimpressed, informed the patriarch that  you will not find him a better
friend. &nbsp; In considerable agony, Stauracius would live another three
months before dying on January 11, 812 of putrefaction in his wound.<a href="#_edn18">[[<b>18]]</b></a>
</p><center>
<p><b><u>Assessment</u></b></p></center>


<div><p>Reigning only two months and eight days, Stauracius
did not rule long enough to make the mark on the Empire that his father
had.&nbsp; Due to his youth, and the fact that even as co-emperor from
A. D. 803-811 he existed in <b><a href="nickkie.html">Nicephorus s </a></b>shadow,
we know next to nothing about his abilities or strengths.&nbsp; While entries
in Theophanes  <i>Chronographia</i> give hints that Stauracius perhaps
had some tactical &amp; strategic skills, and certainly perhaps a measure
of the will that Nicephorus employed, they do not provide a complete picture
of Stauracius as a person.&nbsp; Therefore he remains a brief shadowy figure
in the history of the Empire.

Note that the author of the <i>ODB</i> entry on Staurakios states that
 he raped two beautiful girls. &nbsp; This is an inaccurate reading of
the discussion in Theophanes <i>A. M.</i> 6300 discussion of the bride-show
which states that <i><u>Nicephorus</u></i> chose the two girls, more beautiful
than Theophano, and openly debauched with them.&nbsp; See either the Turtledove
or Mango/Scott translations of Theophanes  <i>Chonographia. </i>On the
political reasoning behind the Imperial Bride-shows see Treadgold (2004),
50 &amp; Treadgold (1979), 410-413. On the issue of the historicity of
the Imperial Brides-shows and for a review of the dissenting literature

that while Bar Hebraeus, the Historia Synomos, Michael the Syrian and the
Syriac fragment all record the death of Stauracius, their stated cause,
and the immediate events prior, are all rather inaccurate.&nbsp; The <i>Chronicle
of 811</i> makes the mistake of saying that Stauracius died after reigning
two months, rather than almost six months after the battle.</p></div>
