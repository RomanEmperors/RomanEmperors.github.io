<br>&nbsp;
</p><p><span class="text-2xl">Maria's origins</span></p></center>

<p>Maria was born the princess Mart'a, daughter of Bagrat IV, king of Georgia,
and his second wife Borena. Bagrat succeeded his father on the Georgian
throne in 1027 and ruled down to 1072. Maria's mother, Borena, was the
sister of Dorgholeli, the ruler of Ovset'i (Alania) in northern Caucasia.<b><a href="#N_1_">[[1]]</a></b>
Maria had two siblings: the future Giorgi II and Mariam.&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior
to Maria's birth there had been fairly close contact between the Georgian
and Byzantine courts, with Georgia as the subservient partner. Her father
Bagrat had himself been sent to Constantinople as a hostage in 1023 when
five years of age; he was released in 1025 just prior to the death of <b><a href="basilii.html">Basil
II</a></b>.<b><a href="#N_2_">[[2]]</a></b> When his father, Giorgi I,
died in 1027, Bagrat was a nine-year old boy and it is probable that his
mother, Queen Mariam, served as regent during his minority. In 1030 Mariam
undertook an important embassy to Constantinople to request the title of
<i>curopalates</i>
for Bagrat and to find him a Byzantine princess as wife. According to the
author of the<i> Chronicle of K'art'li</i>:
</p><p>"... Queen Mariam, mother of Bagrat king of the Ap'xaz, went to Greece
in order to seek peace and an alliance, and also to seek the title of <i>curopalates
</i>for
her son -- as is the custom and right of their house -- and also to bring
back a wife for her son. When she reached Greece and met the king of the
Greeks, he joyfully fulfilled all her requests. He gave oaths and assurances
of alliance and friendship, wrote chrysobulls, bestowed the title of<i>
curopalates</i>, and gave the princess Elene [Helena] as a wife for Bagrat."<b><a href="#N_3_">[[3]]</a></b>
</p><p>This Byzantine princess was Helena Argyropoulaina, niece of<b><a href="romanusiii.html">
Romanus III Argyrus</a></b> (1028-1034), whom Bagrat married in 1032/1033
as his first wife. Though she died shortly afterwards, she may have had
a significant influence in hellenising the Georgian court. In times of
crisis, Constantinople could also be a place of refuge for a Georgian monarch.
According to the <i>Chronicle of K'art'li</i> and the <i>Life of Giorgi
Mt'acmideli</i>, Bagrat IV and his mother Mariam spent three years in Constantinople
in the 1050s before returning to power in Georgia.<b><a href="#N_4_">[[4]]</a></b>
</p><p>Like princes, Georgian princesses could also be summoned as hostages
to the Byzantine court. The young 'Alan princess' ('daughter of the king
there' and 'one of our hostages from Alania') was <b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine
IX Monomachus</a></b>' mistress at the time of his death in January 1055,
perhaps brought there as a pledge of good faith during Bagrat's stay in
Constantinople or part of his family and entourage.<b><a href="#N_5_">[[5]]</a></b>
This princess, a relative of Maria's, may perhaps have been her cousin
Irene, daughter of Bagrat's rebellious half-brother Demetre, who had died
in 1053.<b><a href="#N_6_">[[6]]</a></b> The young Mart'a herself is said
to have initially arrived in Constantinople in 1056 at the end of the reign
of <b><a href="theodoraemp.html">Theodora (1055-1056)</a></b>, presumably,
like other Georgian princelings, as a hostage for her father's conduct:
her age at the time may have been perhaps three years. She was sent home
a few months later at Theodora's death, returning some ten years later
to marry Michael Ducas.
</p><p>The eleventh-century <i>Life of Giorgi Mt</i>'<i>acmideli</i> records
this episode. Giorgi Mt'acmideli (1009-65) was abbot of the Iviron monastery
on Mt. Athos. His biographer Giorgi Mc'ire, c. 1070, recorded that:
</p><p>"For at the time, when the kingdom of the Greeks [i.e., the Byzantine
Empire] was ruled by Queen T'eodora [Theodora], she asked the king of the
Ap'xaz Bagrat to give his daughter Mart'a so that she might be brought
up as her own child. And King Bagrat, with great happiness, sent his daughter
Mart'a [to Byzantium] along with his personal servants. And in those days,
by divine will, Queen Theodora passed away [August 1056]. And at the same
time, Queen Mariam, the mother of King Bagrat, was there and our holy father
[Giorgi Mt'acmideli] was also there on some business. But, as we have said,
at that moment when Queen Theodora passed away, they led Mart'a, the daughter
of Bagrat, into the kingdom [<i>sameup</i>'<i>o</i>, also 'royal' so might
refer to Constantinople, the royal city]. And when the holy man [Giorgi]
saw Mart'a, within everyone's ear-range he prophesied, saying that: 'Let
everyone know that today the Queen has departed and the Queen has arrived.'
And then she stayed for a short time and again they brought Mart'a. And
after some time had elapsed, Dukic' [i.e., Ducas] again summoned her and
she was taken to the imperial city to be his daughter-in-law. Then, as
had been foretold by the monk [Giorgi], when they saw how she had reached
maturity, everyone was surprised and they gave thanks to God, who beforehand
had revealed his will. And Queen Mariam said to the holy man [Giorgi],
when she had been in the east: 'O Father, the prophesy that you foretold
about Mart'a has come to fruition."<b><a href="#N_7_">[[7]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b>Maria 'the Alan'</b></p></center>

<p>In Georgian-language sources Maria is simply known by the Georgian forms
of her name, Mart'a (equivalent to the Greek Martha) and then, once empress,
as Mariam (Greek: Maria). 'Mariam' is used, in Greek transliteration, in
the inscription on the plaque depicting her with <b><a href="mikevii.html">Michael
VII Ducas</a></b> on the Xaxuli (Khakhuli) triptych.<b><a href="#N_8_">[[8]]</a></b>
The inscription reads 'With my hands I crown Michael with Mariam'. It may
have been sent as a gift to her father Bagrat on the occasion of <b><a href="mikevii.html">Michael</a></b>
and Maria's coronation, hence the use of the Georgian form of Maria's name.
Contemporary Georgian-language sources say little about Maria, and she
had relatively little contact with her homeland once she had reached Constantinople,<b><a href="#N_9_">[[9]]</a></b>
though she was mentioned in the acts of the first formal all-Georgian ecclesiastical
council called by King Davit' II in 1103.<b><a href="#N_10_">[[10]]</a></b>
This is evidence for the respect which was paid her in Georgia as ex-empress
of Byzantium.
</p><p>In Byzantine sources May is invariably known as 'the Alan'. This was
presumably because of her mother Borena's origins, as 'the Iberian' or
even 'the Abasgian' would have been the more common Greek usage. <b><a href="annacom.html">Anna
Comnena</a></b> was close to Maria and does not indicate that Maria objected
to the nickname. Apart from Maria's relative, <b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine
IX's</a></b> mistress, there is no other prominent instance of 'Alan' having
been used for 'Iberian'. Byzantine and Islamic writers usually describe
contemporary Georgian rulers as the monarchs of the Ap'xaz (Greek: Abasgians)
or Iberians. Only John Tzetzes, himself Georgian on his mother's side,
labels Maria as 'of Abasgia'. In his poetic commentary the <i>Chiliades</i>
(lines 591-601) he explains that Iberians (Georgians), Abasgians and Alans
are all one people. His grandmother was herself an 'Abasgian' and a relative
of Maria of Alania (not a servant, he insists), who came to Byzantium with
her and was later to become the second wife of the <i>sebastus </i>Constantine,
grand <i>droungarius</i> and nephew of the patriarch Michael Cerularius.<b><a href="#N_11_">[[11]]</a></b>
Maria may have been a Georgian princess, but in fact her homeland and royal
parentage cut little ice with the Byzantines as a whole. Michael Psellus
in his <i>Chronographia</i> speaks vaguely of the wealth and antiquity
of her family, without even bothering to name her country of origin, even
though Maria was the godmother of Psellus' grandson by his adopted daughter.<b><a href="#N_12_">[[12]]</a></b>
Elsewhere he comments that 'the kingdom of Alania was not particularly
distinguished in itself, nor had it any great prestige: indeed, it regularly
supplied pledges of loyalty, such as hostages, to the Byzantine empire'.<b><a href="#N_13_">[[13]]</a></b>
The Continuator of Scylitzes simply calls her an 'Alan', while Bryennius,
who describes her as the daughter of Bagrat, ruler of the Iberians, is
the most accurate in his terminology, perhaps because he was the husband
of <b><a href="annacom.html">Anna Comnena</a></b> who had been intimately
acquainted with Maria and her son Constantine.<b><a href="#N_14_">[[14]]</a><a href="annacom.html">Anna
</a></b>herself
avoids any discussion of Maria's background, as does Theophylact in his
educational treatise written for her son Constantine (<i>Oratio</i> 4;
Gautier 1.184): though royal, her non-Greek, 'barbarian' background was
seen as better glossed over even by her admirers. Clearly, while the Byzantines
could feel positive esteem for the rulers of western European kingdoms,
Maria's Georgian background was considered somewhat of a disadvantage:
in contrast, the lament in 949 for the young Frankish princess Bertha-Eudocia,
the illegitimate daughter of Hugo of Provence, king of Italy (927-947)
and bride of <b><a href="romanusii.html">Romanus II</a></b>, who had been
brought to Constantinople but died before the marriage was consummated,
speaks of her as coming 'from the peoples of Europe, even from those distinguished
and famous for both splendour of birth and greatness of power, and possessing
the thriving and most fertile of the Italian lands'.<b><a href="#N_15_">[[15]]</a></b>
</p><p>Maria's career was the more remarkable because she was only the second
foreigner to reach the Byzantine throne in over 300 years, since <b><a href="leoiii.html">Leo
III</a></b> had arranged the marriage of <b><a href="irene.html">Irene</a></b>,
daughter of the Khazar khagan, with his son <b><a href="constanv.html">Constantine
V</a></b> in 732. Since that time no foreigner had married the heir to
the throne. Franks were in any case traditionally seen as the only foreigners
fit to marry into the Byzantine royal house as Constantine Porphyrogenitus
states in his <i>De administrando imperio,</i> in which he roundly condemns
both <b><a href="constanv.html">Constantine V's</a></b> marriage to <b><a href="irene.html">Irene</a></b>
the Khazar and that of his<b> </b>wife's niece Maria Lecapena to Peter
of Bulgaria<span face="Times">:</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">"</span>And that emperor Leo [III] aforesaid  contracted
an alliance in marriage with the chagan of Chazaria, and received his daughter
to be his wife, and thereby attached great shame to the empire of the Romans
and to himself, because he annulled and disregarded the ancestral injunctions...
For how can it be admissable that Christians should form marriage associations
and ally themselves by marriage with infidels, when the canon forbids it
and the whole church regards it as alien to and outside the Christian order?
Or which of the illustrious or noble or wise emperor of the Romans has
admitted it?' But if they reply: 'How then did the lord Romanus, the emperor,
ally himself in marriage with the Bulgarians, and give his grand-daughter
to the lord Peter the Bulgarian?', this must be the defence: 'The lord
Romanus, the emperor, was a common, illiterate fellow, and not from among
those who have been bred up in the palace, and have followed the Roman
national customs from the beginning; nor was he of imperial and noble stock,
and for this reason in most of his actions he was too arrogant and despotic,
and in this instance he neither heeded the prohibition of the church, nor
followed the commandment and ordinance of the great Constantine, but out
of a temper arrogant and self-willed and untaught in virtue and refusing
to follow what was right and good, or to submit to the ordinances handed
down by our forefathers, he dared to do this thing; offering, that is,
this alone by way of specious excuse, that by this action so many Christian
prisoners were ransomed, and that the Bulgarians too are Christians and
of like faith with us, and that in any case she who was given in marriage
was not daughter of the monarch and lawful emperor, but of the third and
most junior, who was still subordinate and had no share of authority in
matters of government; but this was no different from giving any other
of the ladies of the imperial family, whether more distantly or closely
related to the imperial nobility, nor did it make any difference that she
was given for some service to the common weal, or was daughter of the most
junior, who had no authority to speak of. And because he did this thing
contrary to the canon and to ecclesiastical tradition and the ordinance
and commandment of the great and holy emperor Constantine, the aforesaid
lord Romanus [Lecapenus] was in his lifetime much abused, and was slandered
and hated by the senatorial council and all the commons and the church
herself, so that their hatred became abundantly clear in the end to which
he came; and after his death he is in the same way vilified and slandered
and condemned inasmuch as he too introduced an unworthy and unseemly innovation
into the noble polity of the Romans.' For each nation has different customs
and divergent laws and institutions, and should consolidate those things
that are proper to it, and should form and develop out of the same nation
the associations for the fusion of its life. For just as each animal mates
with its own tribe, so it is right that each nation also should marry and
cohabit not with those of other race and tongue but of the same tribe and
speech."<sup><span size="-1"> </span></sup><b><a href="#N_16_">[[16]]</a></b>

<p><b><span face="Times">Maria and Michael VII Ducas</span></b></p></center>

<p>So when Mart'a-Maria was summoned from Georgia to marry <b><a href="mukevii.html">Michael
VII Ducas </a></b>(1071-1078), this was a radical departure from tradition.
But, while her origins were not highly regarded, this did not prevent Maria
from maintaining her imperial status during three reigns. After <b><a href="mikevii.html">Michael's</a></b>
abdication she then went on to marry the usurping emperor <b><a href="nickiii.html">Nicephorus
III Botaniates</a></b> (1078-1081) and was to aid<b><a href="alexcomn.html">
Alexius </a></b>and Isaac Comnenus in their coup against <b><a href="nickiii.html">Nicephorus</a></b>
and retain great influence in the early part of <b><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius'</a></b>
reign, though she was later involved in a conspiracy against him. Her only
child was Constantine, son and heir of<b><a href="mikevii.html"> Michael
VII Ducas</a></b>, who was betrothed to <b><a href="annacom.html">Anna Comnena</a></b>,
<b><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius
Comnenus' </a></b>eldest child, and the two were named as <b><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius'</a></b>
heirs. During three reigns, from 1071, she maintained her position as Augusta
(empress), and more importantly under Alexius secured that of her son Constantine,
first as heir to the throne and then as son-in-law-designate of the emperor,
until his premature death in or after 1094.
</p><p>Maria arrived in Constantinople at some point between 1066 and 1071
to marry <b><a href="mikevii.html">Michael Ducas</a></b>. The choice of
a Georgian princess was unprecedented, though it was seen in Georgia as
a diplomatic success on Bagrat's side.<b><a href="#N_17_">[[17]]</a><a href="mikevii.html">Michael
Ducas'</a></b> father <b><a href="connieX.html">Constantine X</a></b> had
succeeded to the throne on the abdication of<b><a href="isaaci.html"> Isaac
Comnenus</a></b> in 1059, and perhaps the fact that the regime was a new
one led to this departure from tradition in order to consolidate his position
and to strengthen ties with the East. A further factor may have been the
young Mart'a's appearance, for beauty was much prized in an imperial bride.<b><a href="#N_18_">[[18]]</a></b>
According to <b><a href="annacom.html">Anna Comnena</a></b>, Maria was so
beautiful that -- like the Gorgon's head -- she was capable of rendering
a bystander speechless or rooted to the spot.<b><a href="#N_19_">[[19]]</a></b>
</p><p>The account of the <i>Chronicle of K'art'li</i>, if strictly chronological,
would suggest a date for Mart'a's arrival c. 1065-6,<b><a href="#N_20_">[[20]]</a></b>
while the <i>Life of Giorgi Mt'acmideli</i> states that she was brought
to Constantinople by 'Ducas' (i.e., <b><a href="connieX.html">Constantine
X)</a></b>, which would mean in or before 1067. However, the marriage need
not have taken place immediately, as imperial brides were expected to spend
a period of 'training' in the royal palace prior to their marriage. Maria
and <b><a href="mikevii.html">Michael</a></b> may not have been actually
married until <b><a href="mikevii.html">Michael's</a></b> accession in 1071.
Certainly the couple were married and Maria a 'basilissa' (empress) by
the beginning of 1072.<b><a href="#N_21_">[[21]]</a> </b>It was not uncommon
for imperial brides to be married at fourteen or fifteen years of age,
and she may have been fourteen years of age when she was brought to Constantinople
as bride-designate c. 1066. She could scarcely have been less than three
years of age if sent to Constantinople in <b><a href="theodoraemp.html">Theodora's</a></b>
reign, and so was probably born c. 1052; <b><a href="mikevii.html">Michael</a></b>
was born c. 1050.
</p><p>During Maria's early years at the Byzantine court she must have lived
in the shadow of her mother-in-law, the empress Eudocia Macrembolitissa,
wife of <b><a href="connieX.html">Constantine X Ducas</a></b>. On <b><a href="connieX.html">Constantine's
</a></b>death
in 1067 Eudocia had decided to rule in her own right as 'regent' for her
son <b><a href="mikevii.html">Michael</a></b>, instead of passing the throne
over to him, even though he was technically of age. Eudocia then remarried,
choosing as her consort and emperor the general <b><a href="romandio.html">Romanus
Diogenes.</a></b> During <b><a href="romandio.html">Romanus IV's</a></b>
three year reign (1068-1071) <b><a href="mikevii.html">Michael</a></b> appears
to have played no part in politics, and the two sons of Eudocia and <b><a href="romandio.html">Romanus</a></b>
were crowned as co-emperors.<b><a href="#N_22_">[[22]]</a></b> Eudocia
even considered taking over government again after <b><a href="romandio.html">Romanus'</a></b>
defeat by the Turks at Mantzikert in 1071. It was only when the Ducas family
manoeuvred her into a convent after a month of joint rule by <b><a href="mikevii.html">Michael</a></b>
and Eudocia that <b><a href="mikevii.html">Michael</a></b> was free finally
to assume power.<b><a href="#N_23_">[[23]]</a></b>
</p><p>Once empress, Maria's future was still not secure. <b><a href="mikevii.html">Michael
</a></b>was
not an efficient emperor and his seven years of rule (1071-1078) were marked
by rising unpopularity and inflation.<b><a href="#N_24_">[[24]]</a></b>
A rebellion was only a matter of time. Their son Constantine was born in
1074 and soon made co-emperor: it was the future of her son which was to
be Maria's main priority.<b><a href="#N_25_">[[25]]</a></b> Later in 1074
Constantine was betrothed to Olympias, daughter of the Norman Robert Guiscard.
Olympias was renamed Helena and brought to Constantinople to be educated
by Maria, as was customary.<b><a href="#N_26_">[[26]]</a></b> Psellus describes
Maria as self-effacing and retiring during <b><a href="mikevii.html">Michael's</a></b>
reign,<b><a href="#N_27_">[[27]]</a></b> but she appeared on <b><a href="mikevii.html">Michael's</a></b>
coinage, just as Eudocia Macrembolitissa had on that of her husbands. Psellus'
portrait of his patron and ex-pupil's wife need not be taken at face value,
though his comment that she spoke to no one but her husband may perhaps
suggest that she was not entirely fluent in Greek at this point.
</p><center>
<p><b>Maria and Georgians in Constantinople</b></p></center>

<p>In Byzantium there were a number of families of Armeno-Georgian descent,
such as the Pakourianoi (Bakuriani) and Tornikioi, as well as possibly
the Phokades, Skleroi and the Dalassenoi themselves.<b><a href="#N_28_">[[28]]</a></b>
At least some of these maintained a strong sense of national identity.
Gregory Pakourianos, in the typikon of his monastery, specified that 'Iberians'
-- 'who are near to us by blood' -- were to be given preference over other
foreigners. As Ostrogorsky notes, Pakourianos, even after a brilliant career
in the imperial service, felt himself to be an alien in Byzantine circles
and viewed Greeks with suspicion.<b><a href="#N_29_">[[29]]</a></b> Maria
also brought to Constantinople a number of female relatives as part of
her retinue, which strengthened her connections. One of her relatives was
her 'Alan' cousin Irene ('the daughter of the ruler of Alania'), who was
married by <b><a href="mikevii.html">Michael </a></b>to the military aristocrat
Isaac Comnenus shortly after Michael's accession. The first of their seven
children, John, was born in late 1073. The match was arranged by Maria
according to <b><a href="annacom.html">Anna Comnena.</a><a href="#N_30_">[[30]]</a></b>
It is possible that this cousin Irene was the hostage at court who had
been mistress of <b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine IX Monomachus</a></b>,<b><a href="#N_31_">[[31]]</a></b>
in which case she may have been in Constantinople since c. 1054. However,
Isaac Comnenus' wife was still producing children in 1096 and it is therefore
unlikely that she had been <b><a href="connieix.html">Constantine's </a></b>mistress
more than 40 years earlier. The Irene who married Isaac Comnenus may then
have been another connection of Maria's whom she brought to Constantinople.
Another relative or attendant of Maria's was to become the second wife
of Constantine, the grand droungarius, and Tzetzes' grandmother.<b><a href="#N_32_">[[32]]</a></b>
The second wife of the general Theodore Gabras, whom he married apparently
in 1091 after the death of his first wife Irene, was also a 'most noble'
lady from 'Alania', and the cousin of Isaac Comnenus' wife. This princess
may have been Maria's own sister Mariam.<b><a href="#N_33_">[[33]]</a></b>
Gabras was the governor and <i>de facto</i> ruler of Trebizond following
his recapture of it from the Turks so it was an excellent match. In addition,
Maria either brought with her advisors who were placed at court, or 'Alans'
were promoted under her influence: one of the close friends and advisors
of her second husband <b><a href="nickiii.html">Nicephorus III Botaniates</a></b>
was an 'Alan', while an 'Alan', who possessed the rank of <i>magistros</i>,
was to inform the Comneni of the plot against them and precipitate <b><a href="nickiii.html">Botaniates</a></b>'
downfall.<sup> </sup><b><a href="#N_34_">[[34]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b>Maria and Nicephorus III Botaniates</b></p></center>

<p>The end of <b><a href="mikevii.html">Michael's</a></b> reign was punctuated
by the rebellions of Roussel de Bailleul, Bryennius and the elderly general
<b><a href="nickiii.html">Nicephorus
Botaniates</a></b>, and <b><a href="nickiii.html">Botaniates,</a></b> the
eventual winner, was proclaimed emperor on 7 January 1078. <b><a href="mikevii.html">Michael</a></b>
fled to a monastery at the end of March, later to be made bishop of Ephesus,
and <b><a href="nickiii.html">Botaniates</a></b> entered Constantinople
on 3 April.
</p><p>On <b><a href="mikevii.html">Michael's</a></b> abdication, Maria took
refuge in the Petrion monastery with her son Constantine, but did not take
the veil.<b><a href="#N_35_">[[35]]</a></b> <b><a href="nickiii.html">Nicephorus'</a></b>
second wife Vevdene apparently died shortly after his accession,<b><a href="#N_36_">[[36]]</a></b>
perhaps in early 1079, and he was therefore in the market for another suitable
empress to help legitimise his position. It was a hotly contested competition,
with candidates including Maria, her mother-in-law Eudocia Macrembolitissa,
and Eudocia's daughter Zoe, as well as all the unmarried girls of the capital.
<b><a href="nickiii.html">Botaniates'</a></b>
first choice seems to have been Eudocia,<b><a href="#N_37_">[[37]]</a></b>
but Maria received the support of her Ducas in-laws, especially that of
the Caesar John Ducas,
<b><a href="mikeii.html">Michael's</a></b> uncle,
who advised <b><a href="nickiii.html">Botaniates</a></b> to marry her, rather
than any of the other contenders, because she was extremely beautiful and
was of foreign birth with no crowd of relatives to interfere in government.<b><a href="#N_38_">[[38]]</a></b>
At the last moment, a priest refused to perform the marriage ceremony and
John Ducas had the priest removed and another substituted.<b><a href="#N_39_">[[39]]</a><a href="nickiii.html">Botaniates'</a></b>
marriage to Maria was considered adulterous, since <b><a href="mikevii.html">Michael</a></b>
was still alive. Furthermore, his retirement to a monastery had been forced,
not voluntary, and hence any divorce and remarriage by his wife was invalid;<b><a href="#N_40_">[[40]]</a></b>
on these grounds the priest who celebrated it was deposed.<b><a href="#N_41_">[[41]]</a></b>
Indeed, according to Bryennius (<i>Historia</i>, 253-5),<b><a href="nickiii.html">
Botaniates'</a></b> wife Vevdene was still alive, which would have made
the marriage doubly adulterous.
</p><p>Maria thus became empress for the second time and, as ex-empress, was
the legitimising factor of<b><a href="nickiii.html"> Botaniates'</a></b>
reign. She appears on his silver coinage and the reverse of a <i>miliaresion</i>
depicts their busts, with the obverse bearing the inscription 'Nicephorus
and Maria, faithful <i>basileis</i> of the Romaioi'.<b><a href="#N_42_">[[42]]</a></b>
One of the illustrations in the Coislin MS of the <i>Homilies</i> of John
Chrysostom in Paris shows Christ blessing Maria and <b><a href="nockiii.html">Botaniates</a></b>
In fact, the codex was being made for <b><a href="mikevii.html">Michael</a></b>
at the time of his abdication, and after some alterations was presented
to <b><a href="nickiii.html">Nicephoru</a></b>s instead.<b><a href="#N_43_">[[43]]</a></b>
The imperial couple are shown as equal in size and in full regalia. Nevertheless,
<b><a href="nickiii.html">Botaniates</a></b>
refused to nominate Maria's son Constantine as his successor, selecting
instead his own relative Nicephorus Synadenus. Constantine was allowed
various privileges of imperial rank, such as the right to wear silk shoes
of various colours, but not ones entirely of the imperial purple.<b><a href="#N_44_">[[44]]</a></b>
There was no open break between the imperial couple, despite Constantine's
loss of rank and Maria's attempts to promote her son's position. Her status
was still emphasized on the coinage, and she had been granted the wealthy
Constantinopolitan estates of the Mangana palace and monastery and the
Hebdomon monastery by chrysobull from <b><a href="nickiii.html">Botaniates.</a><a href="#N_45_">[[45]]</a></b>
Near the end of his reign (c. 1081) <b><a href="nickiii.html">Botaniates</a></b>
also honoured Maria's brother, the Georgian ruler Giorgi II, granting him
the high-ranking dignity of Caesar as a sign of his close connection with
the imperial family, Giorgi, had previously held the ranks of <i>curopalates</i>
(as heir), <i>nobilissimus</i>, and then <i>sebastus</i>.<b><a href="#N_46_">[[46]]</a></b>
Furthermore, <b><a href="annacom.html">Anna</a></b> shows <b><a href="nickiii.html">Botaniates</a></b>
at approximately this period discussing the loyalty of his <i>dux</i> of
Illyricum (George Monomachatus) in Maria's presence ('I suspect this Monomachatus
of being an enemy of the Roman Empire'): this was reported to Monomachatus
by John 'an Alan', a friend of Monomachatus' who heard the remark and advised
him to consult his interests (leading to negotiations with Alexius and
his eventual defection).<b><a href="#N_47_">[[47]]</a></b> Maria was therefore
still trusted by<b><a href="nickiii.html"> Botaniates</a></b> and privy
to his discussions with his advisors.
</p><p><b><a href="annacom.html">Anna </a></b>explains Maria's support of the
revolt of the Comneni against her husband as a consequence of her son's
demotion: <b><a href="anncom.html">Anna</a></b> states that if <b><a href="nickiii.html">Botaniates</a></b>
had left the throne to Constantine 'he would have ensured his own safety
to the end... the empress, moreover, would have had more confidence in
him; she would have been more loyal. The old man did not realize the unfairness
and inexpediency of his plans, unaware that he was bringing evil on his
own head'.<b><a href="#N_48_">[[48]]</a></b> Maria was already closely
linked with the Comneni through her cousin Irene's marriage to Isaac Comnenus,
and it was Anna Dalassena, the mother of Isaac and <b><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius
Comnenus</a></b>, who came up with a pretext which would enable them to
visit Maria to discuss her concerns over the succession. <b><a href="annacom.html">Anna</a></b>
clearly saw Maria as a very valuable ally at court.<b><a href="#N_49_">[[49]]</a></b>
Maria's aim in supporting the coup was her desire to have Constantine reinstated
as emperor. To facilitate this, Maria even adopted <b><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></b>,
who was not so much younger than herself (he was born c. 1057), as her
son -- even though his own mother was very much alive -- so he could visit
her frequently and in private.<b><a href="#N_50_">[[50]]</a></b> She was
supposedly persuaded to the adoption by officials of the women's quarters,
presumably her own 'Alans' and her eunuch officials, on the advice of Isaac
Comnenus: <b><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></b> and Constantine were
now adoptive brothers, and Isaac and <b><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></b>
took an oath that they would preserve Constantine's rights as emperor.<b><a href="#N_51_">[[51]]</a></b>
Clearly Maria passed on inside information to the brothers, who were told
of the counter-plot against them by an 'Alan', one of the emperor's friends
and a courtier of long-standing. <b><a href="annacom.html">Anna </a></b>records
the rumour that Maria was aware of his mission, suggesting that some of
the emperor's closest advisers were working in her interests and against
those of the emperor and that Maria herself played a pivotal part in the
plot against her second husband.<b><a href="#N_52_">[[52]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times">Maria and the Comneni</span></b></p></center>

<p><span face="Times">The coup was successful. <b><a href="nickiii.html">Botaniates</a></b>
abdicated on 1 April 1081, and <b><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></b>,
though the younger of the two brothers, become emperor. He moved into the
imperial palace with his adoptive mother Maria and his blood relatives
including his brothers, and was crowned on 4 April, leaving his fourteen
year-old wife <b><a href="irened.html">Irene Ducaena</a></b> with her own
relatives in the 'lower' palace. </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="irened.html">Irene</a></span></b><span face="Times">
was only crowned a week later after pressure from the patriarch, the fleet,
and her Ducas relatives. Maria may certainly have had hopes of becoming
empress for a third time, perhaps with the support of Anna Dalassena, though
Maria's marriage to <b><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius </a></b>would have
been illegal because his brother Isaac was married to her cousin.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_53_">[[53]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
In addition, her first two husbands, <b><a href="nickiii.html">Nicephorus
III Botaniates</a></b> and </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikevii.html">Michael
VII</a></span></b><span face="Times">, were still alive. In her narration
of the events of April 1081 </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="annacom.html">Anna
Comnena</a></span></b><span face="Times"> states (3.1.2) that the Comneni
refused to drive Maria from the palace, because of the many kindnesses
they had received from her as empress and because of their close relationship,
while Maria herself was reluctant to leave because of her lonely position:
'she was in a foreign country, without relatives, without friends, with
nobody whatever of her own folk.' But the Caesar John Ducas now preferred
to see his niece <b><a href="irened.html">Irene</a></b> on the throne, and
arranged for Maria's unwilling departure from the palace, demanding that
the patriarch Cosmas refuse to listen to any of Maria's arguments and instead
support the Ducas faction. Anna Dalassena was also won over by Cosmas'
agreement to abdicate in favour of a new patriarch, her protégé
Eustratius Garidas.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_54_">[[54]]</a></span></b>
</p><p>Maria was still in a powerful position as adoptive mother of the emperor,
with her son Constantine as <b><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></b>'
adoptive brother. Maria had <b><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></b> guarantee
her safety and issue a chrysobull confirming Constantine's imperial privileges
before she left the imperial palace for her own dwelling, the Mangana palace.
In her removal she was formally escorted by Isaac, the new emperor's elder
brother. Constantine was restored to his position as co-emperor and even
outranked Isaac, who was only given the rank of <i>sebastocrator</i>. Constantine
signed documents of state in purple ink after <b><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></b>,
and followed immediately after him in processions.<b><a href="#N_55_">[[55]]</a></b>
In acclamations his name came after that of <b><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></b>
and soon after the birth of <b><a href="annacom.html">Anna Comnena</a></b>,
<b><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius'
</a></b>eldest
child, in December 1083, he was betrothed to her and the two were named
as heirs-apparent.<b><a href="#N_56_">[[56]]</a><a href="annacom.html">Anna</a></b>
went to live with Maria before she was eight years old and Maria, as her
future mother-in-law, was to bring up <b><a href="annacom.html">Anna</a></b>
with Constantine, according to Byzantine custom. <b><a href="annacom,htm">Anna
</a></b>was
in Maria's care from c. 1090 until, it seems, Constantine's death, perhaps
in 1095/6.
<b><a href="annacom.html">Anna</a></b> stresses that Maria was
very fond of her and shared all her secrets with her.<b><a href="#N_57_">[[57]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times">Maria as Monastic and Literary Patron</span></b></p></center>

<p>Maria now lived in the Mangana palace, originally built by <b><a href="connieIX.html">Constantine
IX Monomachus</a></b>, as mother of the co-emperor and mother-in-law designate
of the emperor's eldest daughter. There she held an alternative court and
was the centre of a noted literary circle. She was patron of numerous literary
figures, including Theophylact of Ochrid, Constantine's tutor (who became
Archbishop of Bulgaria in 1088/9), and Eustratius of Nicaea (a western-influenced
pupil of the philosopher John Italos). Theophylact wrote at least one letter
to her: the 'despoina' ('mistress') who is addressed in letter 107 may
be Maria, or perhaps <b><a href="irened.html">Irene Ducaena</a></b>,<b><a href="#N_58_">[[58]]</a></b>
while his letter 4 to Maria when on Principo, perhaps accompanying a gift
of incense, demonstrates their patronage relationship as late as c. 1095.
In his <i>Paideia Basilike</i> (<i>Oration</i> 4) on the education of her
son Constantine, perhaps delivered in 1085/86, Theophylact praises her
piety and love of theology. The work may have been delivered as an oral
presentation in the court of the Mangana palace, as there is no reference
in it to the emperor <b><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></b>. Maria,
therefore, may be assumed to have had a literary circle at which readings
of appropriate works were delivered to her and her retinue. Eustratius
of Nicaea, for example, dedicated 'to my lady Maria of Alania' a meteorological-cum-cosmographical-cum-geographical-cum-astronomical
treatise, in which he promises to explain to her the phenomenon of thunder
and lightning and other natural forces to the best of his ability. The
treatise touches on such topics as: 'On thunder and lightning', 'on the
dimensions of the earth', 'on stadia and miles', 'on the distance between
the sky and the earth', 'on earthquakes', 'on the elements', 'on the antipodes',
'on the four seas', 'on pearls', 'on the firmament', and 'on stars', i.e.,
the zodiac. Eustratius also wrote an anti-Latin polemical treatise, of
which the Georgian version is extant - perhaps both written and translated
at Maria's instance.<b><a href="#N_59_">[[59]]</a></b>&nbsp; Maria was
also a supporter of John Italus, whose group <b><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></b>
repressed at the beginning of his reign in 1082.<b><a href="#N_60_">[[60]]</a></b>
She was also probably a patron of the Georgian neo-Platonist John Petrici
(Petritsi), who was a pupil of Psellus and a friend of Italus who addressed
an essay to an 'Abasgian grammarian' who has been identified with Petrici.<b><a href="#N_61_">[[61]]</a></b>
The date of Michael Psellus' death is not known, though some of his works
were apparently written after 1081,<b><a href="#N_62_">[[62]]</a></b> and
it would be surprising in this case if he too were not part of the literary
circle which formed around his grandson's godmother and imperial pupil's
ex-wife.
</p><p>Theophylact wrote at her request his commentaries on the gospels of
Mark and Luke and the lesser prophets. <i>Vind. Theol. Gr</i>. 90, which
contains his commentary on St Mark and St Luke, appears to be an autograph
presentation copy and the dedication to Maria reads:
</p><p>"Theophylact, leading shepherd of Bulgaria, has harvested these words
which flow with honey for the consideration of the Empress Maria, truly
a work for a most noble soul."<b><a href="#N_63_">[[63]]</a></b>
</p><p>The date at which these commentaries might have been written is unknown,
but clearly after 1088 when Theophylact was made Archbishop: his commentary
on the Acts of the Apostles can be dated to either 1097 or 1108.<b><a href="#N_64_">[[64]]</a></b>
If his other commentaries were composed at the same time, these would show
that Maria's active literary patronage continued even after Constantine's
death and her own retirement.
</p><p>Maria's position was in no way altered by her having become a nun. She
had certainly taken the veil (though not, of course, retired to a convent)
at the time the
<i>Paideia Basilike</i> was delivered, for Theophylact
mentions her austere clothing and ascetic lifestyle, while Zonaras mentions
her as a nun at the time when she visited <b><a href="mikevii.html">Michael
VII</a></b> at his deathbed, c. 1090, when she asked his pardon for marrying<b><a href="nickiii.html">
Botaniates</a></b>.<b><a href="#N_65_">[[65]]</a></b> But, just as in the
case of Anna Dalassena, this transition made little difference to Maria's
lifestyle and she continued with her involvement in charitable concerns
and patronage of monastic institutions, including donations to the Georgian
monastery of Iviron on Mount Athos, and the building of a convent named
Kappatha at Jerusalem with her mother Borena.<b><a href="#N_66_">[[66]]</a></b>
Significantly, Maria not only maintained this contact with her mother,
but Borena herself was a writer of religious poetry and may have influenced
Maria's sponsorship of Byzantine authors and copyists.<b><a href="#N_67_">[[67]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times">Maria as empress-mother</span></b></p></center>

<p><span face="Times">Maria's property holdings were extensive and she
commanded great wealth. Within Constantinople, she possessed the Mangana
palace and monastery (constructed by <b><a href="connieIX.com">Constantine
IX)</a></b> and the Hebdomon Monastery (the burial place of</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basilii.html">
Basil II</a></span></b><span face="Times">). In the country west of Constantinople
she owned estates called Petritzos (Petriconi in Georgian) and Pernikos,
not far from the seaport of Christoupolis (Kavala). Petritzos lies between
the Georgian monastery of Theotokos Petritzonissa and the city of Stenimachos
(in southern Bulgaria), just a few kilometres from each. The area had close
connections with Georgian families and monastic foundations. The Petritzonissa
monastery (modern Bachkovo) had been founded just south of Philippopolis
in 1083 by Gregory Pakourianos (Georgian: Bakuriani), a general of Armeno-Georgian
ancestry, for the use of 50 Georgian monks, primarily family members and
retired soldiers who had served in his army. He endowed the monastery with
extensive properties in the region and he and his brother were buried there.
As Grand Domestic of the West he had been one of the Comneni's fervent
supporters in their coup.[[</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_68_">68]]</a></span></b>
<br><span face="Times">&nbsp;Maria's son Constantine had separate holdings
in the area, most notably a large estate at Pentegostis in Thrace, near
Serres, 'a delightful place with a good supply of cold, drinkable water

</p><p><span face="Times"><b><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></b> remained

was crowned at his baptism, but not publicly proclaimed as co-emperor until

Constantine's status may have gradually declined after <b><a href="johncomn.html">John's</a></b>
birth.<b><a href="annacom.html"> Anna</a></b> speaks of the public acclamations
of herself and Constantine as heirs-apparent as something which she does
not personally remember, which implies that they were discontinued c. 1088,
when she was four or five years of age. The couple's engagement, however,
continued until Constantine's death in or after 1094, after which she married
<b><a href="nickbry.html">Nicephorus
Bryennius</a></b>: they were certainly married in April 1097.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_71_">[[71]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
According to </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nickbry.html">Bryennius</a></span></b><span face="Times">,
Constantine's demotion in rank was due not to <b><a href="johncomn.html">John's

Maria, not unnaturally, was aggrieved at this change in Constantine's status
and still hoped to see him emperor.</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">In the summer of 1094 </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">,

at Constantine's villa. The chosen venue clearly implies that Constantine's
interests were involved and the plot apparently had Maria's support. <b><a href="annacom.html">Anna

that, when<b><a href="nickdio.html"> Diogenes</a></b> was arrested, documents
were found on him which made it clear that Maria knew of the conspiracy,
though (according to <b><a href="annacom.html">Anna</a></b>) she disapproved
of the plan to murder <b><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></b> and was
trying to dissuade Diogenes from it.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_73_">[[73]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">

he was to die shortly afterwards (at least in or before 1097).</span>
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times">Maria's later career</span></b></p></center>

<p><span face="Times">Like so many imperial women, Maria may have chosen
to remove herself to a convent after Constantine's death, and there is
no evidence that her removal to a convent was anything other than her own
choice. Because Theophylact wrote to her c. 1095 while she was staying
on the island of Principo, one of the Prince's Islands in the Sea of Marmara
where there were several monastic foundations, it has been considered that
it was there that she retired after the death of Constantine. However,
Maria may simply have been visiting one of the imperial foundations, and
a more likely scenario is that she retired to the heavily-Georgian influenced
area in which her estates were situated. With Constantine, she may have
founded a monastery at Mount Papikion, some 100 kilometres from the Theotokos
Petritzonissa monastery, and this may have been the site of her retirement
and eventual death. Excavations have uncovered a mid-eleventh century monastic
complex with donor portraits in the main church depicting a mother and
son (perhaps Maria and Constantine), and a grave containing clothing with
silver threads and a gold signet ring with the negative inscription: '(Of)
Maria Botoniatina'.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_74_">]]74]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
This may have been both Maria's foundation and her final resting-place.</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">The date of her death is not known, but the fact
that she was mentioned in the acts of the ecclesiastical council called
by King Davit' II in 1103, as 'Our Queen Mart'a the Augusta,' confirms
that Maria was still alive at that date, at the age of about 50 years,
and highly honoured in her homeland. Her name occurs in a list of commemorations
given for prominent Georgians and is put in first position, even before
that of her nephew King Davit' himself as befitted a Byzantine empress

even stated that no 'Roman' monks or priests should be admitted, on the
grounds that the Greeks were 'violent by nature, deceitful, and grasping'
and might take control of the institution and turn it into their property;
moreover, all monks were to be able to understand written and spoken Georgian
(ch. 1). Ostrogorsky points out (n. 113) that a similar attitude occurs
in the Life of Sts John and Euthymios, founders of the Iviron monastery,
where the 'Greeks' are criticised for trying to extirpate the Georgians
from the monastery; cf. P. Lemerle, <i>Cinq études sur le XIe siècle

together with her children by Diogenes and restored her possessions, as

does not mention the marriage, which is in itself evidence for its illegality.
