<h3>Summary and Introduction</h3>



<p>The Emperor Gaius Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus (A.D. 284-305) put

an end to the disastrous phase of Roman history known as the "Military

Anarchy" or the "Imperial Crisis" (235-284). He established

an obvious military despotism and was responsible for laying the groundwork

for the second phase of the Roman Empire, which is known variously as the

"Dominate," the "Tetrarchy," the "Later Roman

Empire," or the "Byzantine Empire." His reforms ensured

the continuity of the Roman Empire in the east for more than a thousand

years.</p>



<h3>Diocletian's Early Life and Reign</h3>



<p>Diocletian was born ca. 236/237 on the Dalmatian coast, perhaps at Salona.

He was of very humble birth, and was originally named Diocles. He would

have received little education beyond an elementary literacy and he was

apparently deeply imbued with religious piety He had a wife <a href="#Note 1"><b>Prisca</b></a> and

a daughter <a href="#Note 1"><b>Valeria</b></a>, both of whom reputedly were Christians. During Diocletian's

early life, the Roman empire was in the midst of turmoil. In the early

years of the third century, emperors increasingly insecure on their thrones

had granted inflationary pay raises to the soldiers. The only meaningful

income the soldiers now received was in the form of gold donatives granted

by newly acclaimed emperors. Beginning in 235, armies throughout the empire

began to set up their generals as rival emperors. The resultant civil wars

opened up the empire to invasion in both the north, by the Franks, Alamanni,

and Goths, and the east, by the Sassanid Persians. Another reason for the

unrest in the army was the great gap between the social background of the

common soldiers and the officer corps.</p>



<p>Diocletian sought his fortune in the army. He showed himself to be a

shrewd, able, and ambitious individual. He is first attested as "Duke

of Moesia" (an area on the banks of the lower Danube River), with

responsibility for border defense. He was a prudent and methodical officer,

a seeker of victory rather than glory. In 282, the legions of the upper

Danube proclaimed the praetorian prefect Carus as emperor. Diocletian found

favor under the new emperor, and was promoted to Count of the Domestics,

the commander of the cavalry arm of the imperial bodyguard. In 283 he was

granted the honor of a consulate.</p>



<p>In 284, in the midst of a campaign against the Persians, Carus was killed,

struck by a bolt of lightning which one writer noted might have been forged

in a legionary armory. This left the empire in the hands of his two young

sons, Numerian in the east and Carinus in the west. Soon thereafter, Numerian

died under mysterious circumstances near Nicomedia, and Diocletian was

acclaimed emperor in his place. At this time he changed his name from Diocles

to Diocletian. In 285 Carinus was killed in a battle near Belgrade, and

Diocletian gained control of the entire empire.</p>



<center></center>



<h3>Diocletian's Administrative and Military Reforms</h3>



<p>As emperor, Diocletian was faced with many problems. His most immediate

concerns were to bring the mutinous and increasingly barbarized Roman armies

back under control and to make the frontiers once again secure from invasion.

His long-term goals were to restore effective government and economic prosperity

to the empire. Diocletian concluded that stern measures were necessary

if these problems were to be solved. He felt that it was the responsibility

of the imperial government to take whatever steps were necessary, no matter

how harsh or innovative, to bring the empire back under control. </p>



<p>Diocletian was able to bring the army back under control by making several

changes. He subdivided the roughly fifty existing provinces into approximately

one hundred. The provinces also were apportioned among twelve "dioceses,"

each under a "vicar," and later also among four "prefectures,"

each under a "praetorian prefect." As a result, the imperial

bureaucracy became increasingly bloated. He institutionalized the policy

of separating civil and military careers. He divided the army itself into

so-called "border troops," actually an ineffective citizen militia,

and "palace troops," the real field army, which often was led

by the emperor in person.</p>



<p>Following the precedent of Aurelian (A.D.270-275), Diocletian transformed

the emperorship into an out-and-out oriental monarchy. Access to him became

restricted; he now was addressed not as <i>First Citizen</i> (<i>Princeps</i>)

or the soldierly <i>general</i> (<i>Imperator</i>), but as <i>Lord and

Master</i> (<i>Dominus Noster</i>) . Those in audience were required to

prostrate themselves on the ground before him.</p>



<p>Diocletian also concluded that the empire was too large and complex

to be ruled by only a single emperor. Therefore, in order to provide an

imperial presence throughout the empire, he introduced the "Tetrarchy,"

or "Rule by Four." In 285, he named his lieutenant <a href="maxherc.html"><b>Maximianus</b></a>

"Caesar," and assigned him the western half of the empire. This

practice began the process which would culminate with the <i>de facto</i>

split of the empire in 395. Both Diocletian and  <a href="maxherc.html"><b>Maximianus</b></a> adopted divine

attributes. Diocletian was identified with Jupiter and  <a href="maxherc.html"><b>Maximianus</b></a> with

Hercules. In 286, Diocletian promoted <a href="maxherc.html"><b>Maximianus</b></a> to the rank of Augustus,

"Senior Emperor," and in 293 he appointed two new Caesars, <b><a href="chlorus.html">Constantius</a></b>

(the father of <a href="conniei.html">Constantine

I </a>), who was given Gaul and Britain in the west, and <a href="galerius.html"><b>Galerius</b></a>, who

was assigned the Balkans in the east.</p>



<p>By instituting his Tetrarchy, Diocletian also hoped to solve another

problem. In the Augustan Principate, there had been no constitutional method

for choosing new emperors. According to Diocletian's plan, the successor

of each Augustus would be the respective Caesar, who then would name a

new Caesar. Initially, the Tetrarchy operated smoothly and effectively.</p>



<p>Once the army was under control, Diocletian could turn his attention

to other problems. The borders were restored and strengthened. In the early

years of his reign, Diocletian and his subordinates were able to defeat

foreign enemies such as Alamanni, Sarmatians, Saracens, Franks, and Persians,

and to put down rebellions in Britain and Egypt. The easter frontier was

actually expanded.</p>

<h3>Diocletian's Economic Reforms</h3>



<p>Another problem was the economy, which was in an especially sorry state.

The coinage had become so debased as to be virtually worthless. Diocletian's

attempt to reissue good gold and silver coins failed because there simply

was not enough gold and silver available to restore confidence in the currency.

A "Maximum Price Edict" issued in 301, intended to curb inflation,

served only to drive goods onto the black market. Diocletian finally accepted

the ruin of the money economy and revised the tax system so that it was

based on payments in kind . The soldiers too came to be paid in kind. </p>



<p>In order to assure the long term survival of the empire, Diocletian

identified certain occupations which he felt would have to be performed.

These were known as the "compulsory services." They included

such occupations as soldiers, bakers, members of town councils, and tenant

farmers. These functions became hereditary, and those engaging in them

were inhibited from changing their careers. The repetitious nature of these

laws, however, suggests that they were not widely obeyed. Diocletian also

expanded the policy of third-century emperors of restricting the entry

of senators into high-ranking governmental posts, especially military ones.</p>



<p>Diocletian attempted to use the state religion as a unifying element.

Encouraged by the Caesar <a href="galerius.html"><b>Galerius</b></a>, Diocletian in 303 issued a series of

four increasingly harsh decrees designed to compel Christians to take part

in the imperial cult, the traditional means by which allegiance was pledged

to the empire. This began the so-called "Great Persecution."</p>



<h3>Diocletian's Resignation and Death</h3>



<p>On 1 May 305, wearied by his twenty years in office, and determined

to implement his method for the imperial succession, Diocletian abdicated.

He compelled his co-regent  <a href="maxherc.html"><b>Maximianus</b></a> to do the same. <b><a href="chlorus.html">Constantius</a></b>

and <a href="galerius.html"><b>Galerius</b></a> then became the new <i>Augusti</i>, and two new Caesars were

selected, <a href="daia.html"><b>Maximinus</b></a> (305-313) in the east and <a href="severus.html"><b>Severus</b></a> (305- 307) in the

west. Diocletian then retired to his palace at Split on the Croatian coast.

In 308 he declined an offer to resume the purple, and the aged ex-emperor

died at Split on 3 December 316.</p>



<h3><b>Prisca, Galeria Valeria, and Candidianus </b></h3>

<p><img src="/galval.jpg" alt="Coin with the image of Galeria Valeria (c)1998 princeton Economic Institute" height="150" width="150">Galeria Valeria</p>

<p>Prisca was the wife of the Emperor <a href="dioclet.html"><b>Diocletian</b></a>.  She bore him a daughter named Valeria, who was apparently the second wife of the Emperor <a href="galerius.html"><b>Galerius</b></a>.  Although she was a Christian or favorably disposed to Christianity, she was forced to sacrifice to the gods during the Great Persecution of 303. Her husband had built her a home in Nicomedeia.  When  <a href="galerius.html"><b>Galerius</b></a> died in 311, she and her daughter were exiled to Syria by the Emperor <a href="daia.html"><b>Maximinus Daia  </b>

</a>.  She was later arrested and beheaded by the Emperor <a href="licinius.html"><b>Licinius </b>

</a> in 315.</p>

<p>Valeria, like her mother a Christian or Christian sympathizer,  seems to have married  <a href="galerius.html"><b>Galerius</b></a> in 293 and, perhaps in November 308, was raised to the rank of <i>Augusta</i> and <i> Mater Castrorum</i>.  Her husband named a province after her.  She adopted Candidianus,  <a href="galerius.html"><b>Galerius's</b></a> illegitimate son, as her own child; he was betrothed to the daughter of   <a href="daia.html"><b>Maximinus Daia</b>

</a>.  Valeria and her mother Prisca fled from <a href="licinius.html"><b>Licinius </b>

</a>, to whose care they had been entrusted, to the realm of  <a href="daia.html"><b>Daia</b>

</a> after  <a href="galerius.html"><b>Galerius</b></a> died in 311.  When Valeria did not accede to <a href="daia.html"><b>Daia's</b>

</a>wishes to marry him, the emperor took possession of all her property and exiled Valeria and her mother to Syria.  When he died, <a href="licinius.html"><b>Licinius </b>

</a> sentenced her to death.  Valeria escaped from his clutches and survived in hiding for over a year.  <a href="licinius.html"><b>Licinius </b>

</a> eventually captured her and had her put to death <i>ca.</i> 315 along with Candidianus.</p>
