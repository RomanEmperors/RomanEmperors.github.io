<h3>Introduction.</h3>



<p> The reign of Justinian was a turning-point in Late Antiquity. It is the period when

paganism finally lost its long struggle to survive, and when the schism in Christianity

between the Monophysite east and the Chalcedonian west became insurmountable.

From a military viewpoint, it marked the last time that the Roman Empire could go

on the offensive with hope of success. Africa and Italy were recovered, and a

foothold was established in Spain. When Justinian died, the frontiers were still intact

although the Balkans had been devastated by a series of raids and the Italian

economy was in ruins. His extensive building program has left us the most

celebrated example of Byzantine ecclesiastical architecture that still survives: Hagia

Sophia in modern Istanbul. His reign was a period when classical culture was in

sharp decline and yet it had a last flowering, with historians such as Procopius and

Agathias working within the  tradition inherited from Herodotus and Thucydides,

and poets such as Paul the Silentiary who wrote some of the most sensuous poems

that the classical tradition has ever produced. The <em>Codex Justinianus</em>, the
<em>Institutes</em>

and the <em>Digest</em> of Roman jurisprudence, all commissioned by Justinian, are

monuments to the past achievements of Roman legal heritage. Justinian's reign sums

up the past. It also provides a matrix for the future. In particular, there was the bubonic plague,

which appeared in Constantinople in 542, for the first time in Europe, and then

travelled round the empire in search of victims, returning to the capital for a new

crop in 558. The plague ended a period of economic growth and initiated one of

overstrained resources.<a href="#N_1_"><b>[[1]]</b></a></p>



<h3>The Background.</h3>



<p>The name "Justinianus" has almost completely blotted out the name which this

emperor bore at his birth: Petrus Sabbatius. The sole source for his full name,

"Flavius Petrus Sabbatius Justinianus," is the consular diptychs made for his

consulship in 521. The cognomen "Justinianus" indicates that he was the adoptive

son of the emperor <a href="justin.html"><b>Justin</b></a> (518-527), his uncle, and the
adoption must have taken

place before his consulship year, possibly before <a href="justin.html"><b>Justin</b></a> became
emperor. Thus it

was <a href="justin.html"><b>Justin</b></a> who launched his nephew, his sister's son, and
Justinian's influence over

<a href="justin.html"><b>Justin</b></a> was such that later contemporaries regarded Justin's
reign as an extension of

Justinian's. However, in 518, Justinian was only a <em>candidatus</em> under the command

of the Master of Offices and although a tradition attributed to Peter the Patrician had

it that the Excubitors tried to put him forward as emperor to succeed 

<a href="anastasi.html"><b>Anastasius</b></a>, but

he declined, the story is not credible. The story told by John Malalas<a href="#N_2_"><b>[[2]]</b></a>  has the ring of

truth: the imperial chamberlain Amantius was ambitious for power, but since, as a

eunuch, he could not himself become emperor, he gave Justin, the commander of the

Excubitors, the effective palace guard (unlike the <em>candidati </em>and the
<em>scholares</em>, who

were ornamental) money to buy support for his domestic, the count Theocritus.

<a href="justin.html"><b>Justin</b></a> used the money to buy support for himself, and he
began his reign by putting

Amantius to death.</p>





<p>  <a href="justin.html"><b>Justin's</b></a> family came from an area of

 the empire where Latin rather than Greek was

spoken: <a href="justin.html"><b>Justin</b></a> himself was a native of the town of Bederiana
near Nish and his

sister's son, Justinian, was born at the village of Tauresium, near Scupi, <i>ca.</i> 482.<a href="#N_3_"><b>[[3]]</b></a> He

was to rebuild his native village eight years after his own assumption of the purple

and rename it Justiniana Prima, modern Caricin Grad. <a href="justin.html"><b>Justin</b></a>
had risen through the

ranks of the army until he was commander of the Excubitors when the emperor <a href="anastasi.html"><b>Anastasius</b></a>

died on 9 July, 518 and moved from there unexpectedly to become emperor. He

moved quickly to consolidate his position. The patrician Apion, a member of a

famous family that held extensive lands in Egypt, who had been exiled and ordained

a priest in 510, was recalled and appointed prefect. <a href="anastasi.html"><b>Anastasius'</b></a> old enemy, Vitalian,

who had rebelled against his Monophysite policies, was made <em>magister militum

praesentalis</em>, which placed him in charge of the military forces in the capital and put

him in a better position than Justinian to succeed old <a href="justin.html"><b>Justin</b></a>.
Vitalian became consul

in 520, but, in the same year, he was brutally murdered. Justinian, who succeeded

Vitalian as <em>magister militum praesentalis</em>, was suspected, rightly or wrongly. In any

case, the murder removed a dangerous rival. In 521, Justinian himself became

consul, and his inauguration was a blatantly lavish affair, designed to make his mark.

In that year, too, we find Justinian writing to the pope in Rome and speaking of the

empire as "our state", implying thereby that he was <a href="justin.html"><b>Justin's</b></a>
mouthpiece.</p>





<p>It must have been not long after that he married <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a>,
whose earlier life is

described vividly by Procopius in his <em>Secret History</em>, where he provided additions to

his <em>History of the Wars of Justinian</em> which were too lurid to publish. <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a> had

been one of three daughters of the bearkeeper employed by the Green faction in the

Hippodrome, and her mother was a professional dancer and actress. When

<a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora's</b></a> father died, her mother remarried and hoped that
the Greens would

appoint her new husband bearkeeper, for in the bearkeepers' guild  positions usually

passed from father to son, but the decision belonged to the lead pantomime dancer

to make and he was bribed to appoint someone else. Destitute, the mother and her

daughters presented their petition in the Hippodrome, where the Greens rejected

them, but the Blues, who had lost their bearkeeper, gave <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora's</b></a> stepfather the

job.<a href="dora.html"><b> Theodora</b></a> herself became a mime actress as soon as she
was old enough.

<a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a> and Justinian were to remain Blue aficionados;
indeed, up until the "Nika"

revolt of 532, Justinian showed open favoritism towards the Blues.<a href="#N_4_"><b>[[4]]</b></a></p>

<p>According to Procopius, <a href="justin.html"><b>Justin's</b></a> wife <a href="euphem.html"><b>Euphemia</b></a> objected
to the marriage of

Justinian and <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a>  even though she was fond of her
nephew, for actresses and

prostitutes were virtually synonymous; even the church denied them the sacraments.

<a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a> already had a bastard daughter and Procopius reports
that she also had a

son, saved from infanticide by his father, but Procopius' story sounds like malicious

gossip. But after <a href="euphem.html"><b>Euphemia's</b></a> death, <a href="justin.html"><b>Justin</b></a> was willing to clear
the way. He passed a

constitution which said that a contrite actress who abandoned her profession should

recover her pristine condition, and marry whomsoever she chose, even a senator.

Her children would be legitimate. Justinian and <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a>
hoped for children; indeed

years later Theodora was to ask for the prayers of Mar Saba that she might

conceive, but the saint refused to beseech God on behalf of a Monophysite.</p>





<p>For <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a> left no doubt about where her religious
sympathies lay. It may be that

she was converted in the Monophysite stronghold, Alexandria, by the patriarch

Timothy III (517-535), who ventured to shelter the patriarch of Antioch, Severus, the

chief Monophysite spokesman during his lifetime, when he was driven from his see

on <a href="justin.html"><b>Justin I's</b></a> accession.  Procopius<a href="#N_5_"><b>[[5]]</b></a>  relates that before she met Justinian, she had

accompanied the governor of Libya, Hecebolus, to his province and when he

abandoned her, she made her way to Alexandria and thence to the capital, and a late

seventh-century Egyptian text reports that in Alexandria she met Timothy. Procopius

charged that the theological differences of the imperial couple were intended simply

to stir up trouble, but both were devoted to their doctrinal tenets and both were able

to defend them in debate. Justinian respected his wife's beliefs; he promised her

when she was on her deathbed in 548 that he would continue to protect the

Monophysite heretics whom she sheltered in the palace of Hormisdas in

Constantinople. He kept his promise. At the same time, neither Justinian nor

<a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a> could have been unaware of the civil advantages of
their private

theological "quarrel": as long as the Monophysites felt that they had a champion at

court, their allegiance to the emperor and the empire would remain secure.</p>





<p>There was, however, one consequence of the lowly origins of the emperor and

empress. Both placed great emphasis on court ceremonial. The old ruling classes in

Constantinople, who were proud and snobbish even though their pedigrees were

often rather short, had looked down at these new dynasts sprung from peasants and

actors.  Justinian and <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a> paraded their power. <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a> in particular took

pleasure in her new status. Even Justinian's most conspicuous achievement in

architecture, Hagia Sophia, made a statement. Before its construction, the largest

church in Constantinople was the church of St. Polyeuktos, built at the end of

<a href="justin.html"><b>Justin's</b></a> reign by Anicia Juliana, the wealthy scion of one of
Constantinople's "old"

families which boasted imperial blood.<a href="#N_6_"><b>[[6]]</b></a></p>

<p>Justinian succeeded  his uncle on 1 August, 527. He had already been made co-emperor

four months earlier, and coins were minted showing the two emperors seated beside

each other. Old <a href="justin.html"><b>Justin</b></a> may have been less willing to yield
power to his nephew than

later contemporaries believed, for when pope John visited Constantinople in 526, he

favored <a href="justin.html"><b>Justin</b></a> with a coronation ceremony, but did not include
Justinian. But <a href="justin.html"><b>Justin</b></a>

was failing. On August 1, he died of complications arising from an old war wound in

a foot, and Justinian's succession was smooth.</p>





<h3>The Early Years.</h3>





<p>Justinian's first years as emperor were full of action. There was a spate of

legislation, directed against Manichaeans, pagans and Samaritans. Pagans were

barred from the civil service, baptized Christians who lapsed into paganism were to

be put to death, as were any persons caught making secret sacrifice to the gods;

pagan teachers were denied stipends from the imperial treasury and if they would

not accept baptism, they were to lose their property and be banished into exile. It

was probably this last law which put an end to the Neoplatonic Academy in Athens,

which was still a pagan stronghold. The head of the Academy, Damaskios, and six

other philosophers emigrated to Persia, looking for a place with the new king of

Persia, Khusro I, but they returned, disappointed, within less than a year. Some of

them may have settled at Harran (Carrhae) and founded a school there which lasted

into the Islamic period. However Khusro saw to it that one clause in the so-called

"Endless Peace" of 532 between Persia and Justinian promised these philosophers

the right to practice their religion unmolested within the empire, and the promise

seems to have been kept.<a href="#N_7_"><b>[[7]]</b></a></p>

<p>The Samaritans, who claim descent from the tribes of Ephraim and Manassah, are

now reduced to a corporal's guard, but in the early sixth century they seem to have

made up a large number of the farmers in First and Second Palestine. Their center

was Neapolis, Biblical Shechem, and their sacred mountain was nearby Mt.

Gerizim. They were disliked both by Christians and Jews. A law of Justinian's

dating before 529 ordered their synagogues destroyed and took away their right to

bequeath property to the non-orthodox: a favorite method of persecuting persons outside

correct Christian belief. (The right was restored in 551, with the proviso that if a

Samaritan had both Samaritan and Christian heirs, the latter should have sole title to

the legacy). The Samaritans revolted in the summer of 529, coordinating their

uprising with a raid into Syria by al-Mundhir, the sheikh of the Arab Lakhmid tribe

which was a formidable ally of Persia. After some initial success the Samaritans

were defeated; their leader Julian was beheaded and the head sent to the emperor,

and some 20,000 Samaritans were sold into slavery. The agricultural economy of

First and Second Palestine was devastated. Procopius,<a href="#N_8_"><b>[[8]]</b></a>
writing two decades later in

his <em>Secret History</em> complains about deserted farms.  In midsummer, 556, the

Samaritans rose again, this time in Caesarea, and with some Jewish allies. The revolt

was crushed without mercy. After Justinian's death, his successor <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin II</b></a> in 572

renewed Justinian's restrictions on Samaritan legacies and banned them again from

public office. The result was a last revolt and a last suppression which effectively

extinguished the Samaritan problem.</p>





<p>Judaism was still a <em>religio licita</em> under Roman law and the emperor's hand was

relatively light. The rabbinical school at Tiberias was headed by a chief rabbi, called

the archipherecite by the Greeks, who in Justinian's reign was Mar Zutra, the son of

the head of the Jewish community in Babylon, and he exercised many of the powers

once enjoyed by the Jewish patriarch, the <em>Nasi</em>, whose office had come to an end

with the extinction of the House of Hillel in 425. Archaeology shows that in Galilee

and the Golan Heights there was a building boom in synagogues in the fourth and

fifth centuries, which continued into Justinian's reign. Jews had more to fear from

fanatical monks than from the law. Nonetheless in mid-535 we find Justinian issuing

a constitution targeting heretics, pagans and Jews in the newly-conquered prefecture

of Africa: their places of worship were to be turned into Catholic churches. What

was new in this law was that Jews were lumped together with heretics and pagans.

The law seems not to have been enforced as far as Jews were concerned.

Nonetheless, we sense a growing feeling of insecurity among Jews which grew into

antagonism: when the Persians captured Jerusalem in 614, the Jews were to assist

actively in the massacre of the Christians.<a href="#N_9_"><b>[[9]]</b></a></p>





<p>On the eastern front, at Justinian's accession the <em>magister militum</em> was a nephew
of

the emperor <a href="anastasi.html"><b>Anastasius</b></a>, Hypatius, an experienced officer of
no great ability. The

commander of Armenia was Sittas, and the duke of Mesopotamia was Belisarius,

both former members of Justinian's bodyguard where they had come to his notice.

In 529, Justinian replaced Hypatius with Belisarius, whose staff included the

historian Procopius, who served as Belisarius' legal advisor (<em>adsessor</em>). Procopius'

account of the war with Persia at this point in time is biased in favor of his

commander, although later his disillusion was to be bitter. Belisarius had married a

crony of the empress, Antonina, and he rapidly acquired a military reputation: in

June, 530, he won a major victory over a Persian invasion force at <a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;c_d_a531.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=472&quot;)"> <b>Daras</b></a>, the

fortress which <a href="anastasi.html"><b>Anastasius</b></a> had built on the Persian frontier in
violation of treaty

obligations. The following year, however, he suffered a defeat at <a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;c_d_a531.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=472&quot;)"> <b>Callinicum</b></a> on the

Euphrates River and was recalled to Constantinople. Procopius does his best to shift

blame for the defeat from Belisarius onto the Ghassanid (Arab) allies of the empire,

but the account of John Malalas<a href="#N_10_"><b>[[10]]</b></a> serves as a corrective:
Belisarius' leadership had

been barely competent, and al-Harith, the Ghassanid phylarch, and his tribesmen had

given a good account of themselves. But in September, the shah of Persia, Kavadh,

died and his successor Khusro I wanted peace until he could consolidate his

position, for he was not his father's eldest son.  In 532, the empire and Persia agreed

upon the "Endless Peace". Justinian paid handsomely for this peace: 11,000 gold

pounds, but if it had been really "endless" or at least of considerable duration, it

would have been worth the price. As it was, Persia attacked again in 540.</p>





<p>The following year, in 533, Justinian launched an expedition led by Belisarius

against the Vandal kingdom in Africa and Procopius suggests that he already had

this expedition in mind when he recalled Belisarius from the eastern front.<a href="#N_11_"><b>[[11]]</b></a> However,

there is an <em>ad hoc</em> quality about Justinian's campaigns in the west. Justinian felt the

appeal of <em>renovatio</em>, and as the native son of a Latin-speaking area of the empire, he

probably felt an emotional involvement in Italy. But he never forgot the importance

of the eastern provinces and the revenues they brought to the treasury. Yet with the

"Endless Peace", he imagined that the Persian frontier was safe and that his hands

were free to grab whatever opportunities there were for recovering the lost

provinces in the west. As for Belisarius, the "Nika Revolt" was to restore his

standing at court as a loyal, valuable retainer.</p>



<h3><b>The 'Nika' Revolt</b><a href="#N_12_"><b>[[12]]</b></a></h3>





<p>The <a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;nika532.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=475&quot;)"> <b>'Nika' Revolt</b></a> which broke out in January, 532, in
Constantinople, was an

outburst of street violence which went far beyond the norms even in a society where

a great deal of street violence was accepted. Every city worth notice had its chariot-racing
factions which took their names from their racing colors: Reds, Whites, Blues

and Greens. These were professional organizations initially responsible for fielding

chariot-racing teams in the hippodromes, though by Justinian's time they were in

charge of other shows as well. The Blues and the Greens were dominant, but the

Reds and Whites attracted some supporters: the emperor <a href="anastasi.html"><b>Anastasius</b></a> was a fan of the

Reds. The aficionados of the factions were assigned their own blocs of seats in the

Hippodrome in Constantinople, opposite the imperial loge, and the Blue and Green

"demes" provided an outlet for the energies of the city's young males. G. M.

Manojlovic<a href="#N_13_"><b>[[13]]</b></a> in an influential article originally published
in Serbo-Croat in 1904,

argued that the "demes" were organized divisions of a city militia, and thus played

an important role in the imperial defense structure. His thesis is now generally

disregarded and the dominant view is that of Alan Cameron,<a href="#N_14_"><b>[[14]]</b></a>  that <em>demos</em>, whether

used in the singular or plural, means simply "people" and the rioting of the "demes",

the "fury of the Hippodrome", as Edward Gibbon called it, was hooliganism, which

was also Gibbon's view. Efforts to make the Greens into supporters of

Monophysitism and the Blues of Orthodoxy founder on lack of evidence. However,

in support of Manojlovic's thesis, it must be said that, although we cannot show that

the Blue and Green "demes" were an <em>organized</em> city militia, we hear of "Young

Greens" both in Constantinople and Alexandria who bore arms, and in 540, when

Antioch fell to the Persians, Blue and Green street-fighters continued to defend the

city after the regular troops had fled.</p>

<p>Justinian and <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a> were known Blue supporters, and
when street violence

escalated under <a href="justin.html"><b>Justin I</b></a>,  Procopius<a href="#N_15_"><b>[[15]]</b></a> claims that they encouraged it. But since

Justinian became emperor he had taken a firmer, more even-handed stand. On

Saturday, January 10, 532, the city prefect Eudaemon who had arrested some

hooligans and found seven guilty of murder, had them hanged outside the city at

Sycae, across the Golden Horn, but the scaffold broke and saved two of them from

death, a Blue and a Green. Some monks from St. Conon's monastery nearby took the

two men to sanctuary at the church of St Lawrence where the prefect set troops to

watch. The following Tuesday while the two malefactors were still trapped in the

church, the Blues and Greens begged Justinian to show mercy. He ignored the plea

and made no reply. The Blues and Green continued their appeals until the twenty-second race
(out of twenty-four) when they suddenly united and raised the

watchword 'Nika'. Riots started and the court took refuge in the palace. That

evening the mob burned the city prefect's <i>praetorium</i>.</p>

<p>Justinian tried to continue the games next day but only provoked more riot and

arson. The rioting and destruction continued throughout the week; even the arrival of

loyal troops from Thrace failed to restore order. On Sunday before sunrise, Justinian

appeared in the Hippodrome where he repented publicly and promised an amnesty.

The mob turned hostile, and Justinian retreated. The evening before Justinian had

dismissed two nephews of the old emperor <a href="anastasi.html"><b>Anastasius</b></a>,
Hypatius and Pompey,

against their will, from the palace and sent them home, and now the mob found

Hypatius and proclaimed him emperor in the Hippodrome. Justinian was now ready

to flee, and perhaps would have done so except for <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a>,
who did not frighten

easily. Instead Justinian decided to strike ruthlessly. Belisarius and Mundo made

their separate ways into the Hippodrome where they fell on Hypatius' supporters

who were crowded there, and the 'Nika' riot ended with a bloodbath.</p>

<p>A recent study of the riot by Geoffrey Greatrex has made the point that what was

unique about it was not the actions of the mob so much as Justinian's attempts to

deal with it. His first reaction was to placate: when the mob demanded that three of

his ministers must go, the praetorian prefect of the East, John the Cappadocian, the

Quaestor of the Sacred Palace Tribonian and the urban prefect Eudaemon, Justinian

replaced them immediately. He hesitated when he should have been firm and

aggravated the situation. It may well have been <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a>  who
emboldened him for the

final act of repression. Procopius imagines <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a> on the last
day engaging in

formal debate about what should be done, and misquoting a famous maxim that was

once offered the tyrant of Syracuse, Dionysius the Elder "Tyranny is a good

shroud." <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a> emends it to "Kingship is a good shroud"
and readers of

Procopius may have thought wryly that the emendation was unnecessary.<a href="#N_16_"><b>[[16]]</b></a>  The formal

debate, and <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora's</b></a> great scene, was probably a creation of
Procopius'

imagination, but a splendid one.</p>





<p>The 'Nika' revolt left Justinian firmly in charge. The mob was cowed and the

senatorial opposition that surfaced during the revolt was forced underground. The

damage to Constantinople was great, but it cleared the way for Justinian's own

building program. Work in his new church of Hagia Sophia to replace the old Hagia

Sophia that was destroyed in the rioting, started only forty-five days after the revolt

was crushed.<a href="#N_17_"><b>[[17]]</b></a> The two leaders of the Hippodrome
massacre, Mundo and Belisarius,

went on to new appointments: Mundo back to Illyricum as <em>magister militum</em> and

Belisarius to make his reputation as the conqueror of the Vandals in Africa. The

530s were a decade of confidence and the 'Nika' riot was only a momentary crisis.</p>

<h3>The Conquest of Africa.<a href="#N_18_"><b>[[18]]</b></a></h3>

<p>The motive for attacking the Vandal Kingdom in Africa, which was a century old,

was sound. King Hilderic (523-30) had fostered good relations with the Catholics;

exiled bishops were recalled and Catholic churches reopened. But in 530 he was

deposed by his cousin Gelimer and, from his prison, Hilderic appealed to Justinian.

Even so, Constantinople was nervous: an earlier expedition dispatched in 468 had

ended in a disaster which was still remembered. John the Cappadocian, dismissed as

praetorian prefect during the 'Nika' riot but soon reinstated, advised against it. But

Justinian decided upon the expedition nonetheless. There was an influential lobby of

African merchants, churchmen and dispossessed landowners who urged him on, and

the final argument may have been religious: to rescue Africa from their Arian Vandal

rulers whose persecution of Catholics was notorious.</p>





<p>The expedition set sail about the summer solstice in 533 under the command of

Belisarius. The field army numbered about 18,000 men: 10,000 of them infantry and

5,000 cavalry, plus some barbarian federates. In Sicily, Belisarius got the welcome

news that Gelimer was unaware of the offensive and had sent 5,000 men and 120

ships under his brother Tata to put down a rebellion in Sardinia. The expedition

landed at Caput Vada, modern Ras Kaboudia in Tunisia,  and the army marched

along the coast towards Carthage while the fleet accompanied it offshore.</p>





<p>Gelimer reacted by putting Hilderic to death and marched out to resist. But his

tactics misfired and at <a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;ad_tr533.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=471&quot;)"> <b>the Tenth Milestone (Ad Decimum)</b></a> outside Carthage
he was

routed. The next day, Belisarius entered Carthage. Gelimer fled westwards and

joined his troops who had been recalled from Sardinia, but in mid-December  he

suffered another defeat at <a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;ad_tr533.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=471&quot;)"> <b>Tricamarum</b></a>, probably not far from Carthage though
the

actual site is unknown. Gelimer fled and took refuge with the Berbers. After an

uncomfortable winter besieged on "Mt. Papua", he surrendered. As for Belisarius,

rumors circulated that he might make himself an independent king in Africa and,  to

quench them, he chose to return to Constantinople with the Vandal captives and the

booty, although Justinian allowed him the option of remaining in Africa. To

celebrate the victory, a version of a Roman triumph was held in the capital, where

the procession ended in the Hippodrome, with Belisarius and Gelimer both

prostrating themselves before the emperor and empress in the imperial loge. 

Gelimer was granted an estate in Galatia and some 2,000 Vandals were conscripted

into the imperial army.</p>





<p>The Byzantines had yet to face the Berbers, or "Moors" who in the last years of

the Vandal kingdom had encroached on Vandal territory in the south. Belisarius'

successor was his <i>domesticus</i> Solomon, a native of the eastern frontier near Daras and a
eunuch, though his castration was the result of an accident rather than by design.   Appointed both
praetorian prefect of the new African prefecture

(created April, 534) and military commander, initiated a campaign against the Berbers and in
order to contain their razzias, he

built a string of  forts, some of which have survived.  But in 536 a revolt broke out in the army,

and Solomon had to flee to Sicily to get help from Belisarius who had begun his

Ostrogothic campaign. Belisarius made a lightning trip to Africa and saved Carthage

from the rebels but he could not stay, and to meet the growing crisis, Justinian

appointed his cousin Germanus whose military abilities should have guaranteed him

a great career had not he suffered from <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora's</b></a> prejudice.
Germanus crushed the

revolt and for two years Africa was calm. In 539, Solomon was reappointed, and

came with fresh troops.</p>

<p>Solomon first weeded out subversives in the army and then began a campaign

against the Berbers which took him into the Aurès mountain range. Mauretania

Prima was annexed and Solomon built defensive works to protect imperial territory.

When rebellion broke out again in 543, the cause was the blundering of Solomon's

nephew Sergius, a favorite of <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a>, who was appointed
first duke of Tripolitania

and then Solomon's successor after his death in 544. Sergius was disliked both by

his soldiers and by civilians, and the Berbers despised him. In 545, Justinian

appointed another officer, Areobindus, but he proved incompetent and was

assassinated in 546. But later that year, Justinian appointed John Troglita, an

experienced commander who was able to win a major victory in 548, after which

Africa was at peace, and it seems to have been reasonably prosperous thereafter until the Arab

conquest. John Troglita's achievement is memorialized by the <em>Johannid</em>, an epic

written swiftly by an African schoolmaster, Corippus, who

presumably got to Constantinople as a reward, for he was there to write a panegyric

on the accession of <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin II</b></a> when Justinian died.</p>



<h3>The Campaign against the Ostrogoths.</h3>

<p>The Ostrogothic campaign did not end until 552, and it left Italy in ruinous

condition. Yet it seems to have begun on a wave of optimism sparked by the

successes in Africa. The force which Belisarius led to Sicily in 535 was less than

half the size of the one he had taken against the Vandals. It must have seemed to

Justinian that the Gothic regime was tottering and offering a ready opportunity for an

easy victory. The great Theodoric had died one year before Justinian's accession.

His grandson Athalaric was a minor and the regent, his mother Amalasuintha, was

considered too Romanized for the taste of many of the Gothic nobles who were

showing a degree of independence now that Theodoric's  firm hand was gone. At one

point, Amalasuintha felt so threatened that she contemplated flight and got the

promise of refuge in Constantinople, but decided to remain where she was after she

succeeded in disposing of three of her enemies.</p>

<p>When Athalaric died (2 Oct., 534) Amalasuintha tried to strengthen her position by

associating her cousin, Theodoric's nephew, Theodahad, on the throne, but it was an

unfortunate move. Theodahad had her murdered. Justinian now had ample

justification for war, and high hopes for success.</p>

<p>The attack launched in 535 was two-pronged. One spearhead led by Mundo, the

<em>magister militum</em> of Illyricum, led a force to Dalmatia where he was to lose his life
in

a skirmish with the Goths the next year, and the other, commanded by Belisarius

landed in Sicily. Only at Palermo did Belisarius  meet any resistance, and on December 31,

he entered Syracuse, where he laid down the consulship which he had held for that

year. Theodahad attempted negotiation: he sent pope Agapetus I to Constantinople,

where he masterminded the deposition of the patriarch Anthimus, who was too

friendly to Monophysitism, and consecrated a new patriarch, but he achieved

nothing for the Goths. The following spring, Belisarius crossed to the mainland and

had an easy advance until he reached Naples, which had a Gothic garrison. Naples

was entered by an unguarded aqueduct after a twenty-day siege and sacked.

Theodahad's failure to relieve Naples was the last straw as far as the Gothic rank

and file were concerned and they chose a new king, Witigis, not of the Amal royal

house, raising him on a shield according to German custom. Theodahad fled for

Ravenna, but he was overtaken and killed.</p>

<p>The Goths, in council with their new king, decided that the more pressing danger

came from the Franks in the north whom Justinian had incited to invade Italy.

Witigis made for Ravenna where he married Amalasuintha's daughter Matasuintha,

who made an unwilling bride, and bought off the Franks. Belisarius advanced on

Rome where Pope Silverius urged the Romans to invite him into the city. Silverius

had been only recently elected with Theodahad's support, Agapetus having died in

Constantinople, and Witigis had extracted a loyalty oath from him and the Romans,

but Italian sympathies were with the imperial forces. Belisarius entered Rome on 9

December, and prepared for the Gothic counterattack.</p>

<p>On hearing of the fall of Rome, Witigis raised an army which Procopius numbers at

150,000, mostly mailed cavalry, and made directly for Rome. The Gothic siege of

Rome was to last one year and nine days, until mid-March, 537. Both the besiegers

and the besieged began to suffer from hunger and disease and when Byzantine

reinforcements and supplies started to arrive, the Goths sought a truce in order to

send envoys to Constantinople to negotiate terms of peace.  But Belisarius sent

orders to John, the nephew of Vitalian who was wintering in Picenum, that if the

Goths broke the truce, he was to plunder Gothic estates in the area, and when the

Goths did, in fact, break the truce, John launched a campaign which brought him to

Rimini, a day's march from Ravenna where Witigis' unhappy wife Matasuintha

contacted him to offer marriage and betrayal. Alarmed at the threat to Ravenna,

Witigis lifted the siege of Rome and retreated.</p>

<p>As the Goths retreated northwards, they laid siege to Rimini, shutting in John, the

nephew of Vitalian who had remained there in defiance of Belisarius' orders.

Belisarius made no great haste to relieve him, until in mid-538 a new army arrived in

Italy led by the eunuch Narses, <em>praepositus sacri cubiculi</em> and a friend of John. He

argued that John, insubordinate though he might have been, could not be abandoned

to the Goths, and a message arrived from John himself saying that Rimini could not

last any longer than another  week. Belisarius moved swiftly to relieve it, and John

emerged, bitter and ready to ally himself with Narses against Belisarius. The rift

between Belisarius and Narses grew to the extent that they operated independently

and one result was the destruction of Milan in 539, which might have been saved if

the Byzantine general staff had cooperated against the Goths. Learning of the fall of

Milan, Justinian did not assign blame, but he did recall Narses.</p>

<p>Early in 539, the Goths made a move which portended danger. They made contact

with the king of Persia, Khusro, and urged him to set aside the "Endless Peace" and

attack the empire. Khusro was receptive, but the Gothic position in Italy deteriorated

too rapidly: Belisarius took Osimo, south of Ancona, and moved to invest <a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;ra_ar540.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=473&quot;)"> <b>Ravenna</b></a>

itself. Witigis had two options: one was to accept an offer from the Merovingian Franks to

help in return for sharing the rule of Italy, and the other was to negotiate with the

Romans. Justinian's envoys arrived with an offer to leave Italy north of the Po

River, and half the Gothic treasure to the Goths, while the rest would go to the

Romans. In the light of future events, this was a prudent settlement: it would have

established an Ostrogothic kingdom as a buffer in the north of Italy, and freed

Roman troops to deal with the Persian threat. But Belisarius, hoping for another

triumph to match what he had won in the Vandal War, aborted this arrangement.

The rumors that arose after his victory in Africa surfaced again: that he wanted to

make himself king, independent of Constantinople, and the Goths believed them

enough to make him an offer: they would proclaim him emperor in the west, reviving

an office which had lapsed in 476 with the deposition of <a href="auggiero.html"><b>Romulus
Augustulus</b></a>.

Belisarius accepted. Procopius indicates that it was a pretended acceptance, and that

once Ravenna had surrendered, he would reveal himself as a loyal subject of the

emperor. Thus in May, 540, the Romans entered Ravenna, but Justinian, hearing of

the plot, ordered Belisarius to return. The emperor's motive may have been the

danger on the eastern front as much as distrust of Belisarius, but in any case,

Belisarius, with important Goths including Witigis and Matasuintha, and the Gothic

treasure, made their way to the capital, where the emperor's greeting was cool and

mistrustful. Belisarius was not allowed a second triumph. The Goths had already

chosen a new leader, Ildibad, nephew of the king of the Visigoths in Spain, and

when he was assassinated in 541, his nephew in turn, Totila (as Procopius names

him) or Baduila (as the name appears on his coins) was chosen in his place. Totila

was to prove a worthy adversary of the empire.</p>

<h3>The Gloomy 540s</h3>
<p>The decade began with a renewed Persian offensive and the sack of <a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;anti540.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=474&quot;)"> <b>Antioch</b></a>. In 545

Justinian purchased peace on the eastern front but in the Caucasus kingdom of

Lazica, the struggle continued. In 542, bubonic plague struck Europe for the first

time that has been securely recorded. In Italy, the Ostrogoths recovered much of the
ground they had lost, and the empire
lacked the resources and the will to make an      

effective counterattack. In the all-important theological sector, the so-called "Three

Chapters" dispute, which Justinian orchestrated along with <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a> until her death,

was to prove a turning-point between the Orthodox and the Monophysites. <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a>

died of cancer in 548 and her death left the regime less sensitive to the psyche of the

dissidents and perhaps more high-handed in its search for solution to the endless

contention between Chalcedonian and Monophysite.</p>





<p>On the eastern frontier, Armenia, where Justinian was determined to apply Roman

law in matters of marriage and inheritance, provided a <em>casus belli. </em> When trouble

broke out, Justinian dispatched a general with experience in Armenia, Sittas, the

husband of <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora's</b></a> sister Komito, and when he lost his life,
his replacement was

an officer whom the Armenians had reason to mistrust. A deputation of Armenians,

led by members of the old Armenian royal house, the Arsacids, went to Persia and

urged Khusro to make war on Justinian, who, they argued, had already broken the

'Endless Peace'.</p>
<p>In early spring, 540, Khusro crossed into imperial territory and headed for Antioch,

exacting money from various towns along the way. Justinian had dispatched his

cousin Germanus with 300 men to <a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;anti540.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=474&quot;)"> <b>Antioch</b></a> but he could do little and he and the

patriarch had already evacuated the city when Khusro took it. The sack of Antioch

was a devastating blow to imperial prestige. In 541, Belisarius was sent to the

Persian frontier with a force that included some Goths brought from Italy, but

Khusro had turned his attention to Lazica where the Lazi, like the Armenians had

sought an alliance. Khusro captured the Laz town of Petra on the Black Sea but

when he learned that Belisarius was across the Persian frontier he cut short his

campaign. The next year, Khusro advanced once again into Roman territory but

Belisarius checkmated him. Then Belisarius was recalled under somewhat

mysterious circumstances. The truth or something like it is probably to be found in

Procopius' <em>Secret History</em>: word reached the front that Justinian was ill with the

plague and some generals including Belisarius were guilty of loose talk about

Justinian's successor, saying they would not put up with another emperor like him.

<a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a> heard of it, and recalled the officers. One of them was
consigned to a

dungeon for two years. The influence of Antonina, Belisarius' wife, saved him, but a

year elapsed before he was appointed to another command, which took him back to

Italy.</p>
<h3>The Plague</h3>
<p>Procopius<a href="#N_19_"><b>[[19]]</b></a> gives us a good account of the plague,
modelled on Thucydides. This was

clearly bubonic rather than the more deadly pulmonary plague, for Procopius

indicates that people who cared for the ill did not necessarily contract the plague

themselves, and pulmonary plague is directly communicable to another person

whereas the bubonic variety is carried by fleas which live on rodents, particularly

the black rat. Nonetheless bubonic plague is deadly enough: without modern

treatment it can result in death in 40 to 70 per cent of its victims.</p>

<p>The plague moved from city to city in the empire. In 558 it returned to

Constantinople for a new crop of victims. In fact, the number of natural disasters

which befell the empire in Justinian's reign is remarkable: earthquakes, floods and

plague. In the midst of the plague of 542, Constantinople was shaken by an

earthquake. The plague brought a period of economic growth to an end. One

estimate suggests that the population of the empire in 600 was only 60 per cent of

what it was in 500. The loss of so many taxpayers hurt the treasury, though Justinian

does not seem to have greatly curtailed his building program to take declining

revenues into consideration. Recruits for the army became harder to find and

Justinian had to rely more on barbarian troops. The army in Italy, where Belisarius

was in command from 544 to 549 seems in particular to have suffered from lack of new

resources to carry on the war against Totila and the Goths.</p>





<h3>War on the Eastern Front.</h3>

<p>Nonetheless, plague or not, in 543, the Romans fielded an enormous force of 30,000

troops commanded by the <em>magister militum</em> of the East, Martin, for an invasion of

Persian-controlled Armenia. Anyone who cares to argue that Justinian directed his

resources to the conquest of the western Mediterranean and neglected his eastern

provinces should reflect on this campaign; the army, which Martin had at his disposal,

equalled the force which Narses was to take to Italy in 551 to wind up the

Ostrogothic war - and by that time, the empire had recovered somewhat from the

immediate impact of the plague. But the great army which Martin led was routed by

a small Persian force and the campaign came to nothing. Next year Khusro attacked

Edessa, which fought back hard and saved itself; and Khusro had to be satisfied with

the relatively small indemnity of 500 gold pounds. The following year, 545,

Justinian paid Khusro 5000 gold pounds for a 5-year peace. It was an uneasy peace

but it held.</p>
<p>However, in Lazica at the eastern end of the Black Sea, war between the Romans

and the Persians continued with various vicissitudes but in general, the Romans had

the upper hand and in 557 Khusro dispatched his envoy Izedh Gushnap to

Constantinople to negotiate a truce. Khusro now had other enemies to deal with: the

Ephthalites, or "White Huns",  old enemies of Persia, who were now assailed by a

new wave of Turkish nomads who offered Khusro an alliance against the

Ephthalites. In 561, Justinian's envoy, Peter the Patrician, and Izedh Gushnap put

together a 50-year peace. The Persians agreed to evacuate Lazica, and received an

annual subsidy of 420 gold pounds, which was less than the 500 gold pounds a year

which the emperor <a href="anastasi.html"><b>Anastasius</b></a> had agreed to pay Khusro's
father. Taken altogether,

the Romans could claim a modest success.</p>
<h3>The Conclusion of the Ostrogothic War</h3>

<p>Belisarius in Italy was left starved for troops. In December, 545, Totila laid siege to

Rome, which held out for about a year. Belisarius could not relieve it, and it fell in

December 546. Totila considered destroying the city, but Belisarius wrote him to

protest, pointing out how it would damage his reputation if he destroyed a city of

such beauty, and Totila gave up his plan and instead evacuated Rome, taking with

him the senators and sending the rest of the populace into Campania. Rome was left

empty. Then Belisarius took over the city, repaired its walls and re-populated it, and

Totila to his chagrin found that he could not recapture it.</p>
<p>In 548, Belisarius' wife Antonina went to Constantinople to attempt to use her

influence with <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a> to secure reinforcements for Italy, but
when she arrived,

she found <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a> already dead, and believing that Belisarius
could do no more in

Italy, she sought his recall. After Belisarius' departure, Totila took Rome once again

and plundered Sicily. But now Italy had some eloquent advocates in Constantinople.

Pope Vigilius was there, embroiled in the "Three Chapters" dispute but very aware

of the agonies of Rome, and with him were various Roman nobles who had fled the

city. In 550 Justinian took action. He put his cousin Germanus in charge of a large

expedition to Italy. <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a> had always regarded Germanus
and his family as rivals 

and Germanus' career no doubt suffered as a result, but now <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a> was dead. In

preparation for the campaign, Germanus married Matasuintha, the granddaughter of

Theodoric, but while he was organizing his army, he took sick and died in the

autumn of 550. We can only speculate whether or not his marriage portended a

change of policy towards the Ostrogoths, which would seek to win the support of

the Romanized elements among them for the reintegration of Italy into the empire.

Matasuintha gave birth to a posthumous son named Germanus after his father, but

whatever plans for the settlement of the Gothic War Germanus had in mind, they

died with him.</p>
<p>To replace Germanus, Justinian turned to the Armenian eunuch Narses who took

with him an army of some 30,000 men, quite beyond the power of the Ostrogoths to

resist. Narses was also clearly a leader of great ability who, in contrast with

Belisarius, seems to have had no great problem with insubordination among his

troops. In June or July, 552, a decisive battle was fought at <a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;bu_la553.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=471&quot;)"> <b>Busta Gallorum</b></a> in the

Apennines. The Goths were defeated and Totila died of wounds received in the

battle. At the end of October, another battle was fought at <a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;bu_la553.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=471&quot;)"> <b>Mons Lactarius</b></a>, not far

from Naples. After that it was only a matter of mopping up.</p>

<p>Nothing illustrates Justinian's opportunism in the west quite as much as the fact that

at this same time, he had an army campaigning in Visigothic Spain.<a href="#N_20_"><b>[[20]]</b></a>  In 551, a

Visigothic noble, Athanagild, sought Justinian's help in a rebellion against the king,

and next year, Justinian dispatched a force under the octogenarian Liberius, a native

of Italy who had served in succession Odoacer, Theodoric, Athalaric, Amalasuintha,

Theodohad, and Justinian and now at a great age proved himself a successful

military commander. In 555 Athanagild became king and asked the Romans to

withdraw, which they declined to do. Thus the Byzantine empire held on to a small

slice of the Spanish coast until the reign of <a href="heraclis.html"><b>Heraclius</b></a>. There
was a strategic reason

for the Spanish campaign: in 546 the Visigoths had crossed the Strait of

Gibraltar to take Septem and, though the Romans routed them with a surprise attack

on a Sunday while they were at a church service, they still posed a potential danger.

But the overriding reason was that Justinian could not resist what must have seemed

a golden opportunity.</p>

<h3>Theological Contention<a href="#N_21_"><b>[[21]]</b></a></h3>
<p>The theological battlefield, where no one won a victory, left results that were to last

longer than the military campaigns of Justinian's reign. At the start of the reign both

the Orthodox and the Monophysites resisted the idea of a split in Christendom but

by its end, there was a Monophysite hierarchy in place and though there was still no

permanent schism <em>de iure</em>, one did exist <em>de facto.</em> When <a href="justin.html"><b>Justin I</b></a> became emperor in

518, the 'Acacian Schism' still existed and Vitalian, who had raised rebellion twice

against the Monophysite emperor <a href="anastasi.html"><b>Anastasius</b></a>,  driven by a
combination of orthodox

zeal and ambition, was still lurking in his native province of Scythia Minor with the

remains of his military force. <a href="justin.html"><b>Justin</b></a> immediately sent a letter to
Pope Hormisdas

inviting him to send legates to Constantinople to discuss healing the breach, and

Justinian sent a letter as well, summoning Hormisdas in person. (Hormisdas did not

come.) The breach was healed; on Holy Thursday, 519, the patriarch of

Constantinople accepted Rome's conditions. Severus, patriarch of Antioch, the

theological luminary of the Monophysites, escaped to Egypt where the patriarch of

Alexandria gave him refuge. Vitalian returned to Constantinople where he became

Master of the Soldiers in the capital, consul in 520, and then was murdered,  probably

at Justinian's instigation. But the settlement was illusive, as Justinian soon realized,

and within months he was advocating a compromise put forward by a group of

monks from Scythia Minor which got the support of Vitalian, who came from there

himself. Hormisdas himself did not reject this so-called "Theopaschite Doctrine" out

of hand, though in the end, he did. But it was vigorously denounced by ardent

watchdogs of orthodoxy in Constantinople, the 'Sleepless Monks', so called

because they kept up an endless doxology with teamwork day and night in their

monastery on the eastern side of the Bosporus.</p>

<p>In Syria, the concordat between the Pope and<a href="justin.html"><b>Justin</b></a>
unleashed a wave of persecution

against the Monophysite monasteries. The monks in the northern Syro-Arab areas

had the choice of accepting Chalcedon or expulsion; most chose the latter. Egypt

remained a fortress of Monophysitism but outside it there was no refuge. The

persecution was aimed at the Monophysite monks and the clergy who supported

Monophysite doctrine, not at the laity and it had the unintended result of spreading

Monophysite teaching, for it forced many of the monks to mingle with the general

populace.</p>

<p>The persecution continued into the early 530s when <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a> used her influence to

promote dialogue. In 531 a Monophysite delegation came to Constantinople where

the imperial couple gave them quarters in the Palace of Hormisdas. There <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a>

visited them every two or three days, sometimes bringing Justinian with her, and in

the spring, 532, he sponsored a three-day conference between five Chalcedonian

bishops and five followers of Severus. Severus himself came from Egypt in the

winter of 534/5 along with Theodosius, who  became patriarch of Alexandria in early

535, and these two came to an agreement with Anthimus, the new patriarch of

Constantinople. This was an opportunity to rally the moderates on both sides of the

schism and, unfortunately,  it came to nothing. In 536 Pope Agapetus arrived from

Rome on a mission of the Gothic king Theodahad and won Justinian back to

Chalcedonian doctrine. In Dante's <em>Divine Comedy</em> Justinian pays tribute to

Agapetus for his intervention, but in the light of history, papal intransigence has a

great deal to answer for. Having abandoned compromise to satisfy the pope,

Justinian returned to force as the chosen weapon of Chalcedonian belief. Anthimus,

who was replaced by a patriarch consecrated by Agapetus, disappeared into the

Palace of Hormisdas where he remained, outliving his protector <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a>.</p>
<p>All this happened on the eve of Belisarius' invasion of Italy and Justinian may have

had strategic reasons for wanting to keep the pope on his side. But when Agapetus died

shortly after consecrating a successor to Anthimus, <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a>,
apparently with

Justinian's support, plotted to have elected as the next pope Vigilius, a deacon who had

come to Constantinople with Agapetus and promised flexibility. But before Vigilius

could return to Rome, a new pope, Silverius, the son of Pope Hormisdas, had been

chosen with Theodahad's backing. However, during the one year and nine day siege

of Rome by the Goths, Silverius was deposed by Belisarius and Antonina at

<a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora's</b></a> behest and replaced by Vigilius. Thus it was
Vigilius who represented

Rome and Catholicism during the 'Three Chapters' dispute.</p>



<p>This dispute arose from an edict issued by Justinian in 544 condemning the

teachings of Theodoret of Cyrrhus, Ibas of Edessa and Theodore of Mopsuestia. The

last of these was one of the theologians whose teachings fathered Nestorianism and

Theodoret and Ibas had been friends and supporters of Nestorius. By condemning

these three theologians of the previous century, Justinian hoped to make it clear that

the orthodox position differed sharply from Nestorianism and to give the lie to those

Monophysites who argued that the theology of the Nestorians and that of the

Chalcedonians on the nature of the Trinity was essentially the same. However the

Council of Chalcedon had brought Theodoret and Ibas back into communion with the

Church and Theodore, who had died before the council took place, was held in

respect by the Chalcedonians. It was Justinian's theological adviser of the moment,

Theodore Askidas,  who suggested that a condemnation of the Three 'Chapters'

would make for harmony between the Catholics and the Monophysites. Additionally, he was

probably motivated in part by animosity towards the papal nuncio in Constantinople,

Pelagius, later to become pope himself. In fact, the condemnation was irrelevant as

far as the Monophysites were concerned and it aroused hostility in the west,

particularly in Africa. Sentiment among Catholics in the west was such that Vigilius

had little choice but to refuse to accept the condemnation.</p>

<p>Justinian had his way in the end, but Vigilius did not give up the fight until February

554 when at last he anathematized the 'Three Chapters'. By then he was a sick man

and he died on his way back to Rome, where his body was refused interment in St.

Peter's basilica. As his successor Justinian chose the papal nuncio Pelagius who had

vigorously defended the 'Three Chapters' while the dispute was raging, but, now that

he was offered the papal throne on condition that he accept the condemnation, he

accepted. The Roman populace was hostile, but Narses and his troops maintained

firm control and Pelagius was ordained by two bishops and a presbyter, for the usual

compliment of three bishops could not be mustered. Little by little Pelagius won

acceptance in Italy south of the Po River, though Italy north of the Po remained

hostile until the Lombard invasion made unity seem more essential.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Monophysites had been establishing their own hierarchy. In 541, al-Harith, the
sheikh of the Ghassanid tribe of Arabs on the borders of southern Syria,

whose loyalty it was important to maintain, was in Constantinople, and took the

opportunity to ask <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a> for Monophysite bishops for his
tribe. He got two,

consecrated by Theodosius, the exiled Monophysite patriarch of Alexandria who

was living under <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora's</b></a> protection in the palace of
Hormisdas in

Constantinople. The two were Theodore, metropolitan of Bostra, and Jacob

Baradaeus, metropolitan of Edessa. Neither lived in his metropolis. Both were

roving bishops. By Baradaeus' death in 578, he had consecrated 27 metropolitan

bishops and some 100,000 clergy. Justinian tried at first to have him arrested, but he

was never caught and in the end, Justinian let him be, tolerated in fact if not in law.<a href="#N_22_"><b>[[22]]</b></a>

By Justinian's death there was an organized Monophysite church.</p>

<h3>  The Law<a href="#N_23_"><b>[[23]]</b></a></h3>
<p>Roman law in Late Antiquity was in a state of confusion. Emperors issued new

constitutions and rescripts which had the force of law, but they were not

systematically published and even the imperial archives did not always keep copies

of new laws. The situation was muddied further by the great number of legal

opinions offered by legal experts (<em>iurisconsulti</em>) of the second and third centuries.

The emperor Theodosius II had set up commissions in 427 and again in 434 to

prepare a collection of laws issued since 312, and this resulted in the Theodosian

Code issued in 438. Justinian had not been on the throne a year before he set up a

ten-man commission chaired by John the Cappadocian to produce a new code of

imperial law. The commission produced the <i>Codex Justinianus</i> (<em>Codex vetus</em>) on 7

April, 529.</p>

<p>Next Justinian turned to the enormous task of ordering and codifying the legal

opinions of the Roman <em>iurisconsulti</em>. On 15 December 530 he set a commission to

work at it: sixteen lawyers from the legal fraternities of Constantinople and Beirut,

men headed by Tribonian,<a href="#N_24_"><b>[[24]]</b></a> who had already been a
member of the commission that

produced the <i>Codex Justinianus</i>. The result of their labor was published on 16

December, 533. It is the <i>Digest</i>, or to give it its Greek name, the <i>Pandects</i>. At the

same time, a committee also headed by Tribonian was working on a textbook for

law students. Entitled the <i>Institutes</i>, it was published less than a month before the

<i>Digest</i>, on 16 November. One byproduct of all this labor was to make the
<em>Codex</em>

<em>vetus</em> obsolete, and hence a new edition was published on 16 November, 534 and

the first edition has failed to survive. This body of legal achievement has been

known since the sixteenth century as the <em>Corpus Iuris Civilis</em> and it was intended as

a unified body of law. Justinian forbade commentaries on the <i>Digest</i> and probably

the rule applied to the whole <em>Corpus</em>.</p>

<p>Justinian's final legislative achievement was the <i>Novels</i>, new laws which he issued

after the <em>Corpus</em> was published and unlike the laws in the <em>Corpus</em>,
most of these

were issued in Greek. The <i>Novels</i> were not collected until after the emperor's

death, for though he intended a collection, his plan was never carried out. The

<i>Novels</i>, taken together with Justinian's earlier laws which were included in the

<em>Codex</em>, reveal an emperor full of reforming zeal. Not surprisingly, over half the

<i>Novels</i> were issued in the 530's; in the latter part of his reign, Justinian's energies

were increasingly directed toward theology. The impression that emerges from the

Justinian's laws is ambivalent. On matters of religion he strikes us as bigoted and at

the same time remarkably self-confident. On other matters such as provincial

administration, the status of women and slavery he is zealous for improvement.  The

disabilities of women in matters of guardianship and the right to conduct business in

their own right were finally removed completely. Yet we may doubt how effective

Justinian's efforts were, taken as a whole. Justinian's laws reveal his intentions but

we should not suppose that they mirror reality.</p>

<h3>Last Years.</h3>

<p>Misfortune crowded into the final years of Justinian's reign. There was another

Samaritan revolt in midsummer, 556. Next year, in December, a great earthquake

shook Constantinople and in May of the following year, the dome of Justinian's new

Hagia Sophia collapsed, and had to be rebuilt with a new design. About the same

time, the plague returned to the capital. Then in early 559 a horde of Kutrigur 'Huns'

(proto-Bulgars) crossed the frozen Danube and advanced into the Balkans. It split

into three columns: one pushed into Greece but got no further than Thermopylae,

another advanced into the Gallipoli peninsula but got no further than the Long Wall,

which was defended by a young officer from Justinian's native city, while the third,

most dangerous spearhead led by the 'Hun' khan, Zabergan himself,  made for

Constantinople. Faced with this attack and without any forces for defense, Justinian

called Belisarius out of retirement, and Belisarius, using a scratch force, the core of

which was 300 of his veterans, ambushed the Kutrigur horde and routed it.<a href="#N_25_"><b>[[25]]</b></a> Once the

immediate danger was over, however, Justinian recalled Belisarius and took charge

himself. The news that Justinian was reinforcing his Danube fleet made the

Kutrigurs anxious and they agreed to a treaty which gave them a subsidy and safe

passage back across the river. But as soon as they were north of the Danube, they

were attacked by their rivals the Utigurs who were incited by Justinian to relieve

them of their booty. The Kutrigurs raided Thrace again in 562, but they and the

Utigurs were soon to fall prey to the Avars who swept out of the Asian steppes in

the early 560s.</p>

<p>There was discontent in the capital. Street violence was on the increase again. There

were bread shortages and water shortages. In late 562, there was a conspiracy which

almost succeeded in killing the emperor. The chief conspirator was Marcellus, an

<em>argyroprates</em>, a goldsmith and banker, and the conspiracy probably reflected the

dissatisfaction of the business community. But Justinian was too old to learn to be

frugal. He resorted to forced loans and requisitions and his successor found the

treasury deeply in debt.</p>

<p>What remained of the great emperor's achievement? His successor <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin II</b></a>, out of a

combination of necessity and foolhardiness, denied the 'barbarians' the subsidies

which had played a major role in Justinian's defense of the frontiers, and, to be fair,

 which had also been provided by emperors before him. Subsidies had been part of <a href="anastasi.html"><b>Anastasius'</b></a> policy as well, but

that was before the plague, while the imperial economy was still expanding. The

result of <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin II's</b></a> change of policy was renewed hostility
with Persia and a shift of

power in the Balkans. In 567 the Avars and Lombards joined forces against the

Gepids and destroyed them. But the Lombards distrusted their allies and next year

they migrated into Italy where Narses had just been removed from command and

recalled, though he disobeyed orders and stayed in Rome until his death. By the end

of the century only a third of Italy was in Byzantine hands. On the eastern frontier,

<a href="justin2.html"><b>Justin</b></a> alienated the Ghassanid allies and lost the fortress of
Daras, a reverse which

overwhelmed his frangible sanity. For this Justinian can hardly be blamed. No one can deny his

greatness; a recent study by Asterios Gerostergios (<em>see Bibliography) </em>even lionizes

him. But if we look at his reign with the unforgiving eye of hindsight, it appears to

be a brilliant effort to stem the tide of history, and in the end, it was more a failure

than a moderate success.</p>
