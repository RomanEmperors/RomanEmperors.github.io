<h3><b>Theodosius I (379-395 A.D.)</b></h3>

<p></p>
<h3>Origin and Early Career</h3>
<p>Flavius Theodosius was born at Cauca in Spain in about 346 to Thermantia and Theodosius the
Elder (so-called to distinguish him from his son).<a href="#N_1_"><b>[[1]]</b></a> Theodosius the Elder was a senior military
officer serving in the Western empire and rose to become the <i>magister equitum praesentalis</i> under
the emperor <b><a href="vali.html">Valentinian I</a> </b>from late 368 until his execution in early 375.<a href="#N_2_"><b>[[2]]</b></a> As the
son of a soldier, Theodosius was legally obliged to enter upon a military career. He seems to have
served under his father during his expedition to Britain in 367/8, and was the <i>dux Moesiae Primae</i>
by late 374.<a href="#N_3_"><b>[[3]]</b></a> Unfortunately, great controversy surrounds the rest of his career until <a href="gratian.html"><b>Gratian</b></a> had
him hailed as his imperial colleague in succession to the emperor <a href="valens.html"><b>Valens</b></a> at Sirmium on 19 January
379.<a href="#N_4_"><b>[[4]] </b></a>It is clear that he was forced to retire home to Spain only to be recalled to active service
shortly thereafter, but the circumstances of his forced retirement are shrouded in mystery.<a href="#N_5_"><b>[[5]]</b></a> His
father was executed at roughly the same time, and much speculation has centred on the
relationship between these events. A general consensus seems to have emerged, however, that the
future emperor was forced into retirement shortly after the execution of his father at Carthage in
Africa during the winter of 375/6.<a href="#N_6_"><b>[[6]]</b></a>  The same court faction which had engineered the death of
his father managed to persuade <a href="vali.html"><b>Valentinian</b></a> to dismiss him also, or so the consensus goes. This
interpretation of events is incorrect, however, not least because it places far too much trust in a
number of unreliable sources.<a href="#N_7_"><b>[[7]]</b></a></p>
<p>The answer to the mystery surrounding Theodosius' forced retirement lies in Ammianus'
description of a severe defeat which Sarmatian raiders inflicted upon Roman forces in the province
of Valeria in late 374 when they almost annihilated a <i>legio Moesiaca</i>, i.e. a legion from Moesia,
and a <i>legio Pannonica</i>, i.e. a legion from Pannonia.<a href="#N_8_"><b>[[8]]</b></a> These legions had been sent to intercept a
party of Sarmatians who had been pursuing a senior Roman officer named Aequitius deep into
Roman territory, and would undoubtedly have triumphed had they acted together. But they failed
to co-operate, and their quarrelling allowed the Sarmatians to catch them unprepared, defeating
the legion from Moesia first, then the legion from Pannonia. <a href="vali.html"><b>Valentinian's</b></a> reaction to this defeat
can best be judged from his reaction to an earlier defeat which the Alamanni had managed to
inflict on his forces in Gaul during the spring of 365.<a href="#N_9_"><b>[[9]]</b></a> He sought out those who had been the first
to turn and run before the enemy and blamed them for the subsequent defeat. He ordered the unit in
question - the Batavi - to be stripped of their weapons and sold into slavery, and it took the
whole army to persuade him to relent. In this instance, the first of the two units to break and run
had been the legion from Moesia. Hence <a href="vali.html"><b>Valentinian</b></a> would have held their commanding officer
responsible for the wider defeat, and, as the <i>dux Moesiae Primae</i>, Theodosius was the officer
ultimately responsible for this unit. Hence <a href="vali.html"><b>Valentinian</b></a> dismissed Theodosius and sent him home to
Cauca in Spain in the same manner, and for the same reason, that the emperor <a href="constaii.html"><b>Constantius II</b></a> had
dismissed <a href="vali.html"><b>Valentinian</b></a> himself in 357, or the<i> magister equitum per Gallias</i> Marcellus in the same
year.<a href="#N_10_"><b>[[10]]</b></a> He had found him guilty of cowardice.</p>
<p>The best explanation for the death of Theodosius the Elder is that he had tried to intervene on
behalf of his son, and <a href="vali.html"><b>Valentinian</b></a> had had him executed as a result, most probably during the early
new year of 375.<a href="#N_11_"><b>[[11]]</b></a> His son regained his commission within the army only following the death of
<a href="vali.html"><b>Valentinian</b></a> himself on 17 November 375. He seems to have obtained a position similar to that
which he had originally held at his dismissal, that of <i>dux Valeriae</i> perhaps. He campaigned
against the Sarmatians again in 376, during which he was promoted as the <i>magister militum per
Illyricum</i>.<a href="#N_12_"><b>[[12]]</b></a> He remained as <i>magister militum per Illyricum</i> from 376 until 19 January 379 when
the western emperor <a href="gratian.html"><b>Gratian</b></a> appointed him to succeed his eastern colleague <a href="valens.html"><b>Valens</b></a> who had been
killed at the <a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;hadri378.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=474&quot;)"><b>Battle of Adrianople</b></a> on 9 August 378. 
The fact that <a href="gratian.html"><b>Gratian</b></a> chose him as
his new colleague does not necessarily mean that he enjoyed a particularly
good reputation as the best general of his day.
 <a href="gratian.html"><b>Gratian</b></a> had effectively been forced to choose him
since he seems to have been the most senior officer of Roman birth available to him
at the time.<a href="#N_13_"><b>[[13]]</b></a></p>
<h3>Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>The problem confronting Theodosius immediately upon his accession was how to check the Goths
and their allies who were continuing to ravage the Balkans.<a href="#N_14_"><b>[[14]]</b></a> One difficulty was that they had
spread beyond the diocese of Thrace into the dioceses of Macedonia and Dacia in the prefecture
of Illyricum, which had traditionally belonged to the western empire. The result was that <a href="gratian.html"><b>Gratian</b></a>
surrendered the three dioceses of the prefecture of Illyricum to the temporary control of
Theodosius for the duration of the Gothic crisis, while he himself returned to Trier in Gaul.<a href="#N_15_"><b>[[15]]</b></a> The
date of this transfer is disputed, but it seems to have come into formal effect at the beginning of
the new tax year on 1 September 379 and may be presumed to have ended on 31 August 382.
This left Theodosius in control of the entire theatre of operations. Theodosius left Sirmium, the
site of his accession, for Thessalonica in Macedonia which remained his base for the campaign
seasons of 379 and 380. <a href="gratian.html"><b>Gratian</b></a> had transferred some of his own officers and men to
Theodosius in order to assist him in his efforts to rebuild the eastern field-armies, which had been
shattered at the <a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;hadri378.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=474&quot;)"><b>Battle of Adrianople</b></a>. These transfers included his <i>comes domesticorum</i>
Richomer, who became Theodosius' <i>magister peditum praesentalis</i>, a post which he retained until
his death by illness in late 392.<a href="#N_16_"><b>[[16]]</b></a></p>
<p>We are poorly informed about the exact sequence of events during the Gothic war, but
Theodosius' "general" Modares appears to have inflicted an important defeat upon the Goths
somewhere in Thrace in 379.<a href="#N_17_"><b>[[17]]</b></a> Theodosius proved himself willing to recruit one group of
barbarians into his army to use against the other groups who remained hostile, but this was a risky
strategy. In order to reduce the risk, Theodosius transferred some of these fresh barbarian
recruits to Egypt in return for some of the experienced Roman troops stationed there, during late
379 apparently.<a href="#N_18_"><b>[[18]]</b></a> Nevertheless, a large number of his new recruits appeared to have defected to
the other side during the course of his campaign in 380, so that he suffered at least one serious
reverse. He left Thessalonica and entered Constantinople for the first time on 24 November
380.<a href="#N_19_"><b>[[19]]</b></a> He was to remain in Constantinople, or its immediate vicinity, until late 387. During the
winter of 380/1 he wrote to <a href="gratian.html"><b>Gratian</b></a> for his help against the Goths in Illyricum, and <a href="gratian.html"><b>Gratian</b></a> replied
first by sending his "generals" Bauto and Arbogast against them, then by taking to the field
himself.<a href="#N_20_"><b>[[20]]</b></a> They appear to have succeeded in driving the Goths and their allies from Illyricum and
back into Thrace during 381. Theodosius, however, did enjoy a propaganda coup
when the Gothic chieftain Athanaric surrendered to him at Constantinople on
11 January 381, although he died only two weeks
later.<a href="#N_21_"><b>[[21]]</b></a> Theodosius finally reached a settlement with the remainder of the Goths on 3 October
382.<a href="#N_22_"><b>[[22]]</b></a> The exact terms of this settlement have not been preserved, but it is clear that the Goths
were granted the right to settle large amounts of land along the Danube frontier in the diocese of
Thrace and enjoyed an unusual degree of autonomy.<a href="#N_23_"><b>[[23]]</b></a> Many came to serve in the Roman army,
but the terms of their service remain unclear. Many volunteered to serve on a
full-time professional basis, while more were obliged to serve only for the duration of a specific
campaign. The results were that the Goths who settled within the empire remained a constant threat to
its internal stability. A substantial number of Gothic troops defected to the side of <a href="madmax.html"><b>Magnus
Maximus</b></a> when Theodosius joined his forces with those of the young <a href="valenii.html"><b>Valentinian II</b></a> at
Thessalonica in 387 in preparation for their joint campaign westwards against <a href="madmax.html"><b>Maximus</b></a>.<a href="#N_24_"><b>[[24]]</b></a> These
hid in the rough country about Thessalonica until Theodosius managed to drive them back into
Thrace during his return from the West in 391, where they remained a threat as late as 392 when
they managed to kill the "general" Promotus.<a href="#N_25_"><b>[[25]]</b></a> One of their emerging leaders, Alaric, participated in
Theodosius' campaign against <a href="eugene.html"><b>Eugenius</b></a> in 394, only to resume his rebellious behaviour against
Theodosius' son and eastern successor, <a href="arcadius.html"><b>Arcadius</b></a>, shortly thereafter. Nor did the external threat
cease. The "general" Promotus won a notable victory for Theodosius in 386 when he defeated an
attempt by Odotheus and his Greuthungian Goths to force their way across the Danube.<a href="#N_26_"><b>[[26]]</b></a></p>


<p>The East remained relatively quiet under Theodosius. The Saracens rejected their previous treaty
of 377 with the Romans and resumed their raids once more along the frontier from Arabia to Syria
in 383 apparently.<a href="#N_27_"><b>[[27]]</b></a> We do not know the reason for this revolt, but the <i>magister peditum
praesentalis</i> Richomer appears to have crushed it in but one campaign that year. As a result, the
Salihids replaced the Tanukhids as the dominant group among Rome's Saracen <i>foederati</i>. As for
the Persians, Theodosius maintained good relations with a rapid succession of Persian kings
during his reign. Armenia remained a potential source of conflict between the two powers until
they reached agreement upon the division of this country in 387 when Theodosius sent his
<i>magister militum per Orientem</i> Stilicho on an embassy to the Persian court.<a href="#N_28_"><b>[[28]]</b></a> In accordance
with this agreement, the pro-Roman king Arsak retained possession of the western part of
the country, while the pro-Persian king Khosro retained possession of the eastern part.</p>
<h3>Civil Wars</h3>
<p>Theodosius fought two bloody civil wars in quick succession against the usurpers <a href="madmax.html"><b>Magnus
Maximus</b></a> and <a href="eugene.html"><b>Eugenius</b></a>. <a href="madmax.html"><b>Magnus Maximus</b></a> was a fellow Spaniard who even claimed to be a
relative of Theodosius himself.<a href="#N_29_"><b>[[29]]</b></a> Like Theodosius, he was also a pious Catholic. Hence there was
no deep ideological differences between the two. <a href="madmax.html"><b>Magnus Maximus</b></a> had been the commander of a
field army in Britain in 383 when he had led his troops back to Gaul in an attempt to seize
power.<a href="#N_30_"><b>[[30]]</b></a> He forced <a href="gratian.html"><b>Gratian</b></a> to flee from an initial encounter near Paris, but was blamed for
<a href="gratian.html"><b>Gratian's</b></a> assassination near Lyons as he made for northern Italy. This was the only charge
which Theodosius could seriously have held against him in 383, that he had risen to power
through the assassination of a legitimate emperor. War between the two had not been inevitable,
and the orator Themistius undoubtedly exaggerates when he claims that Theodosius set out
against him in 384 with the intention of avenging <a href="gratian.html"><b>Gratian's</b></a> death.<a href="#N_31_"><b>[[31]]</b></a> The young <a href="valenii.html"><b>Valentinian II</b></a>
continued to rule the prefectures of Italy, Illyricum and Africa, which constituted a buffer-ground
between the territories of his two more powerful colleagues. An uneasy peace prevailed until the
late summer of 387 when <a href="madmax.html"><b>Maximus</b></a> sent his troops into northern Italy and forced <a href="valenii.html"><b>Valentinian</b></a> to
retreat to Thessalonica at the eastern extreme of his territory.<a href="#N_32_"><b>[[32]]</b></a> Yet while <a href="madmax.html"><b>Maximus</b></a> may have
struck the first formal blow in this renewed bout of civil war, one suspects that he felt compelled
to act as he did much because of the growing influence of Theodosius over <a href="valenii.html"><b>Valentinian</b></a> and his
ministers. One notes that Theodosius' <i>magister peditum praesentalis</i> Richomer was the uncle of
<a href="valenii.html"><b>Valentinian's</b></a> <i>magister equitum praesentalis</i> Arbogast, who was effectively the sole commander
of <a href="valenii.html"><b>Valentinian's</b></a> forces at this point.<a href="#N_33_"><b>[[33]]</b></a> More importantly, perhaps, <a href="valenii.html"><b>Valentinian </b></a>had appointed
Gildo as his <i>comes Africae</i> <i>ca.</i> 386, and Theodosius had attempted to win Gildo over to his cause
by marrying Nebridius, a nephew of the empress Flaccilla, to Gildo's daughter Salvina.<a href="#N_34_"><b>[[34]]</b></a>The fact
that <a href="madmax.html"><b>Maximus</b></a> suffered some sort of serious defeat at Sicily during the initial stage of the civil war
in 388, and that he committed a large number of men to naval operations off the southern Italian
coast under the command of his <i>magister praesentalis</i> Andragathius, suggests that Theodosius was
well rewarded for his efforts, that he did at least persuade Gildo to defect to his side and seize
Sicily on his behalf.<a href="#N_35_"><b>[[35]]</b></a> Whatever the case, Theodosius joined with <a href="valenii.html"><b>Valentinian</b></a> at Thessalonica
during the late summer of 387, at which time he also married <a href="valenii.html"><b>Valentinian's</b></a> sister Galla. They
launched a joint expedition against <a href="madmax.html"><b>Maximus</b></a> during the summer of 388, defeating his forces in
pitched battles at Siscia, then Poetovio.<a href="#N_36_"><b>[[36]]</b></a> They then forced their way across the Alps and captured
<a href="madmax.html"><b>Maximus</b></a> himself at Aquileia. They had him executed three miles outside Aquileia on 28 August
388, and sent Arbogast to do the same to his son <a href="flavvict.html"><b>Victor</b></a> in Trier. However, they spared his wife
and two daughters.</p>
<p>Theodosius spent about three years in Italy until he began his return trip to Constantinople in the
summer of 391. <a href="valenii.html"><b>Valentinian</b></a> now ruled the whole of the western empire, but he was increasingly
dominated by his <i>magister peditum praesentalis</i> Arbogast, whose own arrogance increased the
further Theodosius moved from the scene. Matters came to a head in 392 when <a href="valenii.html"><b>Valentinian</b></a> tried
to cashier Arbogast and Arbogast simply refused to accept his command.<a href="#N_37_"><b>[[37]]</b></a> <a href="valenii.html"><b>Valentinian </b></a>secretly
wrote to Theodosius for his assistance, but was found dead on 15 May 392. An uneasy peace
followed as Arbogast awaited the news of Theodosius' reaction to the death of his
brother-in-law <a href="valenii.html"><b>Valentinian</b></a>; Theodosius tried to determine whether <a href="valenii.html"><b>Valentinian</b></a> really had
committed suicide as alleged.<a href="#N_38_"><b>[[38]]</b></a> Unfortunately for all concerned, Theodosius was still married to
Galla, who refused to accept that her brother had committed suicide. Worse still, Arbogast's
strongest advocate at Theodosius' court, his uncle Richomer, was mortally ill. As a hostile
judgement seemed increasingly likely, Arbogast struck first. He hailed <a href="valenii.html"><b>Valentinian's</b></a> <i>magister
scrinii</i> as emperor on 22 August 392 and quickly secured Italy for his cause. In contrast to his
acceptance of <a href="madmax.html"><b>Maximus</b></a> for several years, Theodosius refused to recognise <a href="eugene.html"><b>Eugenius</b></a> as emperor
right from the start. He publicly indicated this by his refusal to accept <a href="eugene.html"><b>Eugenius'</b></a> nominees for the
consulship of 393 and by his coronation of his second son <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius</b></a> as Augustus on 23 January
393. The war did not begin until the summer of 394 when Theodosius finally began his march
from Constantinople. The war was decided by one decisive <a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;frig394.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=473&quot;)"> <b>battle on the banks of the river
Frigidus</b></a> in the foothills of the Alps on 6 September 394.<a href="#N_39_"><b>[[39]]</b></a> While Christian sources delight to
recount how God assisted Theodosius by sending a wind to blow his enemies' weapons back into
their faces,<a href="#N_40_"><b>[[40]]</b></a> the crucial factor was surely the decision by a key section of <a href="madmax.html"><b>Maximus'</b></a> army under
the <i>comes</i> Arbitio to defect from his side to that of Theodosius.<a href="#N_41_"><b>[[41]]</b></a> So Theodosius triumphed and
had <a href="eugene.html"><b>Eugenius</b></a> executed, while Arbogast committed suicide.</p>
<h3>Religious Policy</h3>
<p>Theodosius was Catholic and received baptism at the hands of bishop Acholius of Thessalonica
during the autumn of 380 when serious illness threatened his life.<a href="#N_42_"><b>[[42]]</b></a> Two days after his first arrival
in Constantinople on 24 November 380, Theodosius expelled the "Arian" bishop Demophilus of
Constantinople from the churches of that city and surrendered them to Gregory of Naziaznus who
happened to be the leader of the small Catholic or "Nicene" community there at the time. This was
greatly resented and may even have resulted in an attempt to assassinate the emperor.<a href="#N_43_"><b>[[43]]</b></a> He also
called a synod of 150 Catholic bishops who assembled at Constantinople in May 381. An early
meeting of this synod, when all the bishops had not yet arrived, elected Gregory of Nazianzus as
the new Bishop of Constantinople, but he was quickly forced to resign. The synod then elected the
senator Nectarius, who obviously enjoyed the strong backing of the emperor himself, in his stead.
Theodosius' early reign witnessed the gradual expulsion of all heretical bishops from the towns
and cities of the East and the transfer of all church buildings and property to their Catholic rivals.
The depth of resentment which such policies caused can best be judged by the fact that in 388
"Arian" mobs at Constantinople rioted and caused widespread damage in reponse to the false
rumour that <a href="madmax.html"><b>Magnus Maximus</b></a> had inflicted a severe defeat upon Theodosius.<a href="#N_44_"><b>[[44]]</b></a></p>
<p>Theodosius continued to tolerate the traditional pagan practices and rituals which had enjoyed
toleration from successive Christian emperors throughout the fourth century, i.e., almost anything
which did not include blood-sacrifice or did not smack of treason against the emperor, until 391 at
least. He then issued a series of laws which seemed effectively to prohibit all pagan worship by
forbidding visits to pagan sites of worship or even the adornment in any manner of the images of
the gods.<a href="#N_45_"><b>[[45]]</b></a> This apparent change of policy on his part has often been credited to the increased
influence of bishop Ambrose of Milan.<a href="#N_46_"><b>[[46]]</b></a> For in 390 Ambrose had
excommunicated Theodosius because he had ordered the execution of several
thousand of the inhabitants of Thessalonica in response to the murder there
of his "general" Butherichus. Theodosius accepted his excommunication and
even performed several months of public penance, so it is all too easy too
imagine how he might have taken the time to review his other "failings"
also, including his continued toleration of paganism.<a href="#N_47_"><b>[[47]]</b></a> However, the importance
of these laws has been greatly exaggerated.<a href="#N_48_"><b>[[48]]</b></a> They were limited in scope, specific measures in
response to various petitions and accusations and tell us less about Theodosius than the
private agenda of many of the increasingly militant Christians who could be found throughout his
administration. Although he had voiced his support earlier for the preservation of temples or
pagan statues as useful public buildings or as works of art, in 391 he officially sanctioned the
destruction of the most famous of the temples in the East, the Serapeum at Alexandria.<a href="#N_49_"><b>[[49]]</b></a> Bands
of monks and Christian officials had long been accustomed to take the law into their own hands
and destroy various centres of pagan worship, but the destruction of the Serapeum seemed to
confirm that such actions had often enjoyed the emperor's tacit approval at least, and 
served to encourage such action in the future also. Again, however, Theodosius had been effectively
 manipulated into sanctioning the destruction of the Serapeum by local officials who had
essentially engineered the crisis there for this very purpose.</p>
<h3>Family and Succession</h3>
<p>Theodosius married twice. His first wife was the Spanish Aelia Flavia Flaccilla.<a href="#N_50_"><b>[[50]]</b></a> She bore him
<a href="arcadius.html"><b>Arcadius</b></a> <i>ca.</i> 377, <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius</b></a> on 9 September 384, and Pulcheria <i>ca</i>. 385. Theodosius honoured her
with the title of Augusta shortly after his accession, but she died in 386. In late 387 he married
Galla, daughter of <a href="vali.html"><b>Valentinian I</b></a> and full-sister of <a href="valenii.html"><b>Valentinian II</b></a>.<a href="#N_51_"><b>[[51]]</b></a> She bore him <a href="gratian.html"><b>Gratian</b></a> <i>ca</i>. 388, <a href="galla.html"><b>Galla
Placidia</b></a> <i>ca</i>. 388/390, and died in childbirth in 394, together with her new-born son John.<a href="#N_52_"><b>[[52]]</b></a>  Of his two sons who survived infancy, he appointed
<a href="arcadius.html"><b>Arcadius</b></a> as Augustus on 19 January 383 and <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius</b></a> as Augustus on 23 January 393. His
promotion of <a href="arcadius.html"><b>Arcadius</b></a> as a full Augustus at an unusually young age points to his determination
right from the start that one of his own sons should succeed him. He sought to strengthen
<a href="arcadius.html"><b>Arcadius'</b></a> position in particular by means of a series of strategic marriages whose purpose was to
tie his leading "generals" irrevocably to his dynasty. Hence he married his niece and adoptive
daughter Serena to his <i>magister militum per Orientem</i> Stilicho in 387, her elder sister Thermantia
to a "general" whose name has not been preserved, and <i>ca.</i> 387 his nephew-in-law Nebridius to Salvina,
daughter of the <i>comes Africae</i> Gildo.<a href="#N_53_"><b>[[53]]</b></a> By the time of his death by illness
on 17 January 395, Theodosius had promoted Stilicho from his position as one of the two <i>comites
domesticorum</i> under his own eastern administration to that of <i>magister peditum praesentalis</i> in a
western administration, in an entirely traditional manner, under his younger son <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius</b></a>.
Although Stilicho managed to increase the power of the <i>magister peditum praesentalis</i> to the disadvantage of his colleague the <i>magister equitum praesentalis</i> and claimed that Theodosius had
appointed him as guardian for both his sons, this tells us more about his cunning and ambition than
it does about Theodosius' constitutional arrangements.<a href="#N_54_"><b>[[54]]</b></a></p>
<p>Theodosius' importance rests on the fact that he founded a dynasty which
 continued in power until the death of his grandson Theodosius II in 450. 
This ensured a continuity of policy which saw the emergence of Nicene
 Christianity as the orthodox belief of the vast majority of Christians
 throughout the middle ages. It also ensured the essential destruction of
 paganism and the emergence of Christianity as the religion of the state, 
even if the individual steps in this process can be difficult to identify. 
On the negative side, however, he allowed his dynastic interests and 
ambitions to lead him into two unnecessary and bloody civil wars which 
severely weakened the empire's ability to defend itself in the face of 
continued barbarian pressure upon its frontiers. In this manner, he put the interests of his family before those of the wider Roman population and was responsible, in many ways, for the phenomenon to which we now refer as the fall of the western Roman empire.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p><a name="N_1_">[[1]]</a>On his origin at Cauca, see Zos. 4.24.4. His date of birth is calculated from his death in his
fiftieth year in January 395, <i>Epit.</i> 48.19. The name of his mother is preserved only at <i>Epit</i>. 48.1.</p>
<p><a name="N_2_">[[2]]</a><i>Pan. Lat</i>. 2(12).5.2 preserves the fullest surviving account of the movements of Theodosius the
Elder throughout his career, but fails to note his rank or position at any particular time. On this
passage, see Nixon and Rodgers (1994), 517-19. Amm. Marc. 28.3.9 proves that he succeeded
Jovinus as the <i>magister equitum praesentalis</i> following his return in late 368 from an expedition
to Britain. He is normally identified as a <i>comes rei militaris</i> before this, with little effort to define
what exactly is meant by this term.  See Birley (1981), 333-39.
 I believe that he succeeded Charietto as the <i>vicarius</i> of the
<i>magister equitum praesentalis</i> Jovinus in early 365 and retained this post until he succeeded
Jovinus in 368.</p>
<p><a name="N_3_">[[3]]</a>On his service in Britain, see Zos. 4.24.4. On his position as <i>dux Moesiae</i>, see Amm. Marc.
29.6.15; Zos. 4.16.6. He had presumably served on his father's staff as a
 <i>protector domesticus</i>, a member of the imperial bodyguard seconded to 
his command. Note, for example, that the ten <i>protectores domestici</i> who 
had accompanied the <i>magister militum per Gallias</i> Ursicinus to Cologne in
 355 had consisted of friends and relatives for the most part 
(Amm. Marc. 15.5.22).</p>

<p><a name="N_5_">[[5]]</a><i>Pan. Lat</i>. 2(12).9; Theod. <i>HE</i> 5.5.1-2. It has traditionally been accepted that the emperor Gratian
recalled Theodosius to active service only sometime after the battle of Adrianopole
on 9 August 378, i.e., that he remained in retirement in Spain for almost three years 376-78. See,
e.g., Sivan (1996), 199. But Errington (1996a), 438-40, exposes Theodoret's account of
Theodosius' recall to service for the fictitious nonsense it is and dates his recall as early as late
377.</p>
<p><a name="N_6_">[[6]]</a>See, e.g., Nixon and Rodgers (1994), 453; Williams and Friell (1994), 23-4. Differences
sometimes emerge, as when Errington (1996a), 443-44, argues that their enemies forced the
younger Theodosius into retirement first before they dared to move against his father, or when
Matthews (1975), 93, claims that the younger Theodosius "withdrew to a judicious retirement"
after his father's execution as if he did so entirely voluntarily. Nevertheless, all accept that
Theodosius the Elder was executed at Carthage, and that his execution and his son's "retirement"
should both to be dated to the winter of 375/76.</p>
<p><a name="N_7_">[[7]]</a>E.g., Oros.
7.33.7 is our only source to locate Theodosius' death at Carthage, and
only because Carthage was the administrative centre for the region. He may
also have been influenced by the fact that Arcadius had had the rebellious
<i>comes Africae</i> Heraclianus executed at Carthage <i>ca</i>. 413. In contrast, Amm.
Marc. 29.5.1-55 reveals not the slightest indication that Theodosius had
visited Carthage even once during his stay in Africa <i>ca.</i> 373-4. Writing
ca. 417, during the reign of Theodosius' grandson Arcadius, Orosius was
principally concerned to fill in the flattering assumption that the father
of such a pious dynasty had surely received baptism before his death.  As for 
the date of Theodosius' execution, Jerome is our only source, and he 
dates it to 376 (<i>Chron. s.a</i>. 376). Note, however, that he does not date 
the execution of Theodosius the Elder alone to 376 but associates it with
 the deaths of many other notables also. If he is not simply mistaken,
 as he is on other occasions, it is arguable that he refers to a series 
of executions, which culminated in 376, rather than that they all necessarily occurred in the same year.</p>
<p><a name="N_8_">[[8]]</a>Amm. Marc. 29.6.13-14. These legions have traditionally been identified with two palatine
legions whose names are recorded together in the <i>Notitia Dignitatum</i>, the <i>Pannoniciani seniores</i>
(<i>ND Oc.</i> 5.149) and the <i>Moesiaci seniores</i> (<i>ND Oc</i>. 5.150), e.g. by Hoffmann (1969), 433. There
are several objections to this identification. The first must be that their titles do not actually match.
Ammianus records the names of other palatine legions in the exact form that they have been
preserved by the <i>Notitia</i> so that we cannot simply assume some literary licence on his part in this
instance. He refers to the <i>Primani</i> (<i>ND Or</i>. 6.45) by their correct title (Amm. 16.12.49) and the
<i>Divitenses Iuniores</i> and the <i>Tuncgrecani Iuniores</i> by theirs (Amm. 26.6.12), and to the<i> Lanciarii</i>
and the <i>Mattiarii</i> (Amm. 21.13.16, 31.13.8), whether <i>seniores</i> or <i>iuniores</i> (<i>ND Or</i>. 5.42, 6.42; <i>Or.</i>
6.47, Oc. 7.30), as such rather than as, say, the <i>legio lanciaria</i> or the <i>legio mattiaria</i>. Next, a pair of
palatine legions, a so-called "brigade" in the manner of the <i>Pannoniciani seniores</i> and the <i>Moesiaci
seniores</i> should have been long used to operating together so it is difficult to understand why they
should have quarrelled so badly here. Next, one notes that Ammianus does not say where exactly
they came from, and the speed with which they arrived upon the scene inclines one to suspect that
they had not had to come very far at all. Finally, it must strike one as a remarkable coincidence
that the first two palatine legions to arrive in response to attacks upon the Pannonias and Moesia
Prima should have been named after those very regions.</p>

<p><a name="N_11_">[[11]]</a><i>Cf</i>. his earlier petition on behalf of the advocate Africanus who had merely wanted a second
provincial governorship, Amm. Marc. 29.3.6. In response, Valentinian had ordered him to behead
Africanus. It is beyond the scope of the present article to explore the evidence in full, but I believe
that Theodosius the Elder reached the Pannonian provinces in order to lead their defence against
the Sarmatians sometime during late 374, and that he then reported back to Valentinian himself at
Trier. He is probably identifiable as one of the "missing" consuls for 375.
   Jerome is the only author to explain why there appear to have been no
 consuls for 375, claiming that the consuls remained the same as the 
previous year because of the Sarmatian devastation of the Pannonian
provinces (<i>Chron. s.a.</i> 375). This was true in a round about way, 
in so far as the Sarmatian attacks did set off a chain of events that
 resulted in the execution of Theodosius the Elder and the disgrace of his 
consular colleague, but not in the way that Jerome implies. The Sarmatian
 attack upon the Pannonias was an embarassment rather than a serious 
military crisis, as is best revealed by the fact that it did not provoke
 Valentinian I to leave his capital at Trier until the spring of 375, when 
the worst was over. If such an attack had prevented Valentinian from
 appointing new consuls for 375, then it is a wonder that there were any 
new consuls at all during the far more serious crises of the subsequent
 decades.</p>

probably <i>prima</i> (<i>ND Or</i>. 5.1), by the time of his death, since Theodosius had merged the infantry

defector to such a high rank without first having tested his ability and loyalty at a lower level of
command. So one suspects that he is identifiable with the <i>dux Arabiae</i> to whom Ammianus refers
as Munderichus (Amm. 31.3.5), and that Ammianus, or his source, have confused Modares' name with
his Gothic title <i>reiks</i> "leader of men".</p>

Valentinian's mother Justina sailed across the Ionian Sea to Italy with some of her children, and
that Maximus had initially assembled his fleet in order to capture her. He then kept the fleet in
being because he feared that Theodosius was about to launch a naval expedition. It suffices to
note that this would have left Valentinian's family stranded behind enemy lines in danger of being
used as hostages against him. McLynn (1994), 293-4, assumes that Valentinian himself led a naval
expedition which gained the victory at Sicily. But Valentinian had no military experience, and if he
and Theodosius had really wanted to open a second front, then it would have been far less risky,
and potentially far more beneficial, had they sent their forces to land on the eastern coast of
peninsular Italy instead, as far north as possible. They would then have been able to strike
Maximus' main lines of defence in northern Italy from behind.</p>

 Arbogast claimed that Valentinian had not given him his command in the
 first place so he could not now take it away from him. This is often
 interpreted as evidence that Theodosius had somehow imposed him upon
 Valentinian and that he was the tool by which Theodosius had continued
 to control his western colleague. It refers, rather, to the fact that
 he had essentially "inherited" the post of
 <i>magister peditum praesentalis</i> from his father Bauto <i>ca.</i> 386. 
Neither emperor had been in a position to nominate an alternative candidate

exaggerated the religious aspects of the conflict for ideological reasons, although many modern
commentators have traditionaly accepted their propaganda at its face value. The claims, for
example, that Eugenius' forces erected statues of Jupiter in the Alps (Aug. <i>Civ. Dei</i> 5.26), or that
they bore an image of Hercules at their head as they marched (Theod. <i>HE</i> 5.24) are not to be
taken literally. They have their origin in a deliberate misrepresentation of the significance of the
fact that the two leading western military units, the <i>Ioviani seniores</i> and the <i>Herculiani seniores</i>,
had probably restored their standards to what they imagined to be their traditional form. See

that Stilicho negotiated an important treaty with the Persians shortly 
before his marriage to Serena. I interpret this to refer to the 
treaty of 387 by which the Romans and Persians agreed upon the division 
of Armenia between their empires. This means that Stilicho's daughter 
Maria can only have been about 10 years of age by the time of 
her marriage to Honorius in about February 398. But this explains the 
tradition preserved at Zos. 5.28.2, that Serena herself thought that 
Maria was too young for marriage, even if one cannot accept Zosimus' 
fanciful solution to this problem, that Serena managed
 to drug Honorius in order to prevent him from consummating the marriage, over 
a period of ten years apparently !</p>

<p><a name="N_54_">[[54]]</a>Relying principally on Zos. 4.59, Cameron (1969) argues that Theodosius
 had appointed Stilicho as <i>magister militum per Occidentem</i> with 
command of all the western troops and the power to administer the western
 empire in Honorius' name some three months before his death in January 
395. At that point, Theodosius made a vague statement entrusting his sons to 
Stilicho which the latter interpreted in his own interest to mean that 
his earlier regency over Honorius had now been extended over Arcadius 
also. But the office of <i>magister militum per Occidentem</i>, or 
whatever other title one wishes to use to describe the appointment of a 
single supreme military commander, was entirely without precedent and an 
obvious threat to the independence of any emperor. One suspects, rather, 
that Theodosius had appointed Stilicho to an entirely regular command, i.e.
 as <i>magister peditum praesentalis</i>, at that point three months before
 his death, and that Stilicho asserted a regency which he had yet to enjoy over
 either son.</p>
