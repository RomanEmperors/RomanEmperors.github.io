<b>Antonia Minor</b></h3></center>

<center>
<h4>
Donna Hurley</h4></center>

<p>Antonia Minor, the "lesser" or "younger" Antonia, was born on January
31, 36 BC <b><a href="#N_1_">[[1]]</a></b>. Like all freeborn Roman girls,
she carried the feminine form of her father's family name, and <i>minor</i>
indicates that she was the second daughter of <b><a href="marcant.html">Marc
Antony</a></b>. Her older sister was Antonia Maior. They had no additional
names. Her mother was Octavia, the sister of <b><a href="auggie.html">Julius
Caesar Octavianus</a></b>, who would become the Emperor Augustus. Her parents'
marriage had been intended to bond <b><a href="auggie.html">Octavian</a></b>
and <b><a href="marcant.html">Antony </a></b>during the period known as
the Second Triumvirate, but in the end it proved insufficient to hold their
alliance together. The two men eventually fought it out, and <b><a href="marcant.html">Antony</a></b>
was with Cleopatra by the time he died. After his death, <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus
</a></b>generously allowed his nieces, the two Antonias, to benefit from
their father's estate <b><a href="#N_2_">[[2]].</a></b>
<br>&nbsp;
</p><center>
<p><b>Marriage and Children</b></p></center>

<p><b><a href="auggie.html">Octavian</a></b>, once he became sole ruler
of Rome and took the name of Augustus, consolidated the influence of his
extended family and was energetic in strengthening the dynasty by means
of careful marriage alliances. He had no sons himself, only a single daughter,
<b><a href="julia.html">Julia</a></b>, by his first wife Scribonia, but
he inherited stepsons through his second wife, <b><a href="livia.html">Livia
Drusilla</a></b>. <b><a href="livia.html">Livia</a></b> brought to their
marriage two sons by her former husband, Tiberius Claudius Nero. The older,
born in 42 BC, would become the Emperor <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>.
The second, Nero Claudius Drusus, referred to as <b><a href="drusus.html">Drusus</a></b>
or Drusus the Elder, was born in 38 BC, and <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
chose him as the husband for Antonia Minor. Antonia and <b><a href="drusus.html">Drusus
</a></b>had an unknown number of children of whom three lived to adulthood.
They were evidently married by 16 BC, for<b><a href="germanicus.html"> Germanicus,
</a></b>their oldest surviving son, was born around 15. After <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b>
came a daughter, (Claudia) Livia or Livilla, born perhaps in 13. Their
youngest, <b><a href="claudius.html">Tiberius Claudius Nero,</a></b> later
the emperor Claudius, was born in 10 BC <b><a href="#N_3_">[[3]]</a></b>.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p><b><a href="drusus.html">Drusus</a></b> and his brother <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>
were successful field commanders for <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
in the Alpine and Danube regions and in territory controlled by the German
tribes east of the Rhine. Their victories between 15 and 9 BC brought renown
both to themselves and to their commander-in-chief. In 18 BC <b><a href="drusus.html">Drusus</a></b>
entered the <i>cursus honorum</i> five years before the legal age and advanced
to the praetorship in 11 and the consulship in 9. He died while campaigning
in Germany that year. <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b> returned
his body to Rome for an elaborate funeral in connection with which he delivered
one eulogy and <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b> another. <b><a href="drusus.html">Drusus</a></b>'
ashes were placed in the Mausoleum that <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus
</a></b>had built for his family, and he was awarded the honorific <i>cognomen
</i>Germanicus, which was to be passed on to his male descendents. As a
consolation, his mother <b><a href="livia.html">Livia</a></b> received honors.
<b><a href="drusus.html">Drusus</a></b> was clearly a much-favored prince
of the house of <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>. His glory reflected
on those about him, including his wife Antonia <b><a href="#N_4_">[[4]]</a></b>.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><center>
<p><b>The Widow in the Court</b></p></center>

<p>Left a hero's widow, Antonia remained a significant presence within
the imperial court. She was only twenty-seven when <b><a href="drusus.html">Drusus</a></b>
died, and a new marriage and an additional opportunity for dynastic alliance
were possible through her. Although<b><a href="auggie.html"> Augustus</a></b>
is said to have urged this, she never remarried and so embodied the Roman
ideal of the chaste woman, a <i>univira, </i>a woman who had only one husband
throughout her life <b><a href="#N_5_">[[5]]</a></b>. It was an ideal not
often realized. But despite the sterling reputation that seemed to set
her apart from and above the swirl of family intrigue, she was very much
a part of the court dynamic. Her behavior toward her physically impaired
younger son <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius </a></b>was no better than
that of <b><a href="livia.html">Livia,</a></b> who refused to speak with
him, or that of his sister Livilla, who prayed he might never rule Rome.
Antonia called him "a monster of a man, not yet a finished product of nature
but only begun" <b><a href="#N_6_">[[6]]</a></b>. She and <b><a href="livia.html">Livia</a></b>
together chastised him for covering in his history the cruel years between
the death of Caesar and the emergence of <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
as first man of Rome, a narrative that would have reflected badly on both
of their husbands. A few years before <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
died, he wrote a letter to his wife in which he asked her to confer on
what could be done with young <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>,
whose unseemly affects were an embarrassment. He suggests that <b><a href="livia.html">Livia</a></b>
share the letter with Antonia and bring her into the discussion. The exchange
illustrates how the imperial family operated; <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
was in charge and his wife was an important confidante, but Antonia belonged
to the inner circle as well <b><a href="#N_7_">[[7]]</a></b>.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>When <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b> died in AD 20, Antonia
did not attend her son's public funeral, nor did <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>
or <b><a href="livia.html">Livia</a></b>. Tacitus speculates that ill health
or overwhelming grief caused her absence or that <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>
forbade her to go. It may, however, have been a decision that they all
avoid the highly charged emotional atmosphere surrounding the funeral.
There followed an inquiry into <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus'
</a></b>death and especially into the seditious activity of Cn. Calpurnius
Piso, who was accused of undermining <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus'
</a></b>authority in Asia Minor. At the conclusion of this, in the official
thanksgiving voted for the avenging of <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b>,
Antonia's name was included along with those of the rest of the family's
inner circle -- <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>,<b><a href="livia.html">
Livia</a></b>, <b><a href="aggiei.html">Agrippina (the wife of Germanicus)</a></b>,
Drusus (the son of Tiberius), Livilla and <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>.
Her steadfast loyalty to her deceased husband was noted in the decree's
official language: "Antonia, mother of Germanicus Caesar, who, having experienced
a single marriage . . .has shown by the integrity of her character that
she was worthy of such close kinship with the deified Augustus" <b><a href="#N_8_">[[8]].</a></b>
When <b><a href="livia.html">Livia</a></b> died in AD 29, Antonia, as the
senior woman in the household, inherited the role of respected queen mother.
Her grandson <b><a href="gaius.html">Gaius Caesar (Caligula)</a></b>, the
youngest son of <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b>, and his
sister Drusilla fell to her care at that time, and it seems that <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>,
who had also lived with <b><a href="livia.html">Livia</a></b>, came into
her house as well. Her friendship was valuable. She favored the Judean
prince Herod Agrippa because of her close relationship with his mother
Berenice, niece of Herod the Great <b><a href="#N_9_">[[9]]</a></b>.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>Her most important -- and really only -- direct intervention in matters
of state came in AD 31 when she informed <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius
</a></b>of the conspiracy against him being planned by the aggressive praetorian
praefect L. Aelius Sejanus. She dispatched a letter of warning to the emperor,
who was now in self-imposed isolation on Capri. According to one source,
the letter was carried by her freedman Pallas, who would become wealthy
and influential under <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>; in another
it was carried by Caenis, later the mistress of <b><a href="vespasia.html">Vespasian</a></b>.
<b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b> quickly removed Sejanus from
power, and he was killed. Antonia's daughter Livilla had become involved
in an affair with Sejanus and so shared his fate. It would be said later
that<b><a href="tiberius.html"> Tiberius </a></b>was willing to spare her
but that her mother killed her by starvation. Antonia is again portrayed
as consistently loyal to the dynasty -- even at the expense of her own
daughter <b><a href="#N_10_">[[10]]</a></b>.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><center>
<p><b>Death and Posthumous Honors</b></p></center>

<p>Antonia Minor died at the age of 72 on May 1, 37 AD, shortly after the
death of <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b> and the accession of
<b><a href="gaius.html">Gaius</a></b> in March of that year. One of her
grandson's first imperial acts was to grant her the title Augusta and give
her all the honors that <b><a href="livia.html">Livia</a></b> had enjoyed.
He made her a priestess of the cult of <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
and gave her the privileges of the Vestal Virgins. The <i>Acts of the Arval
Brothers</i> confirm that she received her title from <b><a href="gaius.html">Gaius</a></b>
because they record a sacrifice to Antonia Augusta on her birthday the
following January <b><a href="#N_11_">[[11]]</a></b>. But <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>,
when he became emperor in AD 41, also gave her the name of Augusta and
added a ceremonial carriage to transport her image in the Circus and established
games to honor her birth. This repeated conferral of the title Augusta
is explained by the fact that <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>
refused to ratify the <i>acta </i>(ordinances) of his predecessor, and
so any measures that he wanted to perpetuate (such as this recognition
of his mother) had to be reenacted. But the doubling has further importance,
for it made it possible to claim that it was not <b><a href="gaius.html">Gaius</a></b>
but <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius </a></b>who had so honored her.
She was said to have declined the title from <b><a href="gaius.html">Gaius</a></b>,
and in the few weeks between his accession and her death, he refused to
see her when she wanted an audience with him, drove her to her death by
his insults and even poisoned her. When she died, he ignored her funeral.
These reports of disrespect that contradict reports of his honors for her
and more importantly, the inscription that names her Augusta during the
reign of <b><a href="gaius.html">Gaius</a></b>, served to separate her from
her reprehensible grandson. An anecdote adds to the separation: She caught
him in bed with his sister Drusilla during the time when both lived with
her. This image of her as the disapproving grandmother cleared her of the
responsibility that she had in the rearing of him<b><a href="#N_12_"> [[12]]</a></b>.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>Both when she lived and after her death, Antonia Minor was held up as
an example of old-fashioned virtue, a pillar of respectability in the imperial
court. She was indeed loyal but to more than dead husband. She and <b><a href="drusus.html">Drusus</a></b>
gave stature to the principate of their son <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>,
who stood outside the Julian line and needed to be accepted as a member
of the imperial family. And she was a helpmate to her brother-in-law <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>
and to the family as a whole as it turned itself into a dynasty.
