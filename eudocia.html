<h3>Aelia Eudocia (Wife of Theodosius II)</h3>

<h3>Geoffrey
Greatrex</h3>

<center>Dalhousie University</center>
<p>Aelia Eudocia, whose first name was Athenaïs, was born into a pagan
family probably around the start of the fifth century. Her father, Leontius,
was a prominent philosopher, who ensured that his daughter received a thorough
and traditional education. He may have been Athenian - hence the name of
his daughter - or a native of Antioch, a city which liked to claim a traditional
link with Athens.<b><a href="#N_1_">[[1]]</a></b> Probably after her father's
death, the young girl came to Constantinople, where she was baptised a
Christian. At some point she became known to the Emperor<b><a href="theo2.html">
Theodosius</a></b>, who married her on 7 June 421.<b><a href="#N_2_">[[2]]</a></b>
Despite her education and late baptism, her subsequent travels and endowments
in Palestine, as well as her literary output (discussed below) point to
a rather more Christian than pagan attitude.<b><a href="#N_3_">[[3]]</a></b>
Henceforth she was known as Aelia Eudocia. Her brothers, Valerius and Gessius,
were promoted to important posts, as was her uncle Asclepiodotus, and she
herself came to exercise an influence comparable to that of <b><a href="theo2.html">Theodosius'</a></b>
sister <b><a href="pulcheria.html">Pulcheria </a></b>over the emperor.<b><a href="#N_4_">[[4]]</a></b>
She was swiftly able to put her literary skills to work, extolling the
performance of the Roman troops in their war against Persia, which ended
in 422, in a hexameter poem.<b><a href="#N_5_">[[5]]</a></b>
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>In the same year (422), Eudocia gave birth to a daughter,<b><a href="eudox.html">
Licinia Eudoxia</a></b>, and no doubt in consequence she was made Augusta
on 2 January 423. Gold <i>solidi</i> were issued with her portrait on the
reverse, just as they had been for <b><a href="pulcheria.html">Pulcheria</a></b>.<b><a href="#N_6_">[[6]]</a></b>
The empress continued to build upon her position and it is highly likely
that she was instrumental in the setting up of what is generally known
as the 'university' of Constantinople in the mid-420s. By a series of laws,
<b><a href="theo2.html">Theodosius</a></b> set up and endowed various chairs
in the imperial capital, thus putting in order the somewhat chaotic situation
of higher learning there. Eudocia's uncle Asclepiodotus, the praetorian
prefect, was probably also involved. Building work at Athens in the 420s
has also been associated with the rise to prominence of Eudocia's family.<b><a href="#N_7_">[[7]]</a></b>
Moreover, she was active in sponsoring building work in the imperial capital,
founding (<i>e.g.</i>) the Church of St Polyeuktos. Such indeed was her
reputation as a builder that one early sixth-century source, the 'Oracle
of Baalbek' referred to Byzantium changing its name to Eudocopolis-Constantinopois;
the region situated between the walls built by Constantine in the fourth
century and under <b><a href="theo2.com">Theodosius II</a></b> in the fifth
was probably known initially as Eudocopolis.<b><a href="#N_8_">[[8]]</a></b>
At the same time, efforts were made to curtail the persecution of the Jews,
a minority who had suffered particularly during the time of <b><a href="pulcheria.html">Pulcheria's</a></b>
ascendancy.<b><a href="#N_9_">[[9]]</a></b>
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>At some point in the 420s, however, the tide turned against Eudocia.
It was <b><a href="pulcheria.html">Pulcheria</a></b> who played a leading
role in the downfall of Nestorius, the patriarch of Constantinople, who
was unseated as patriarch in 431. Nothing is heard of Eudocia in this episode.
She did, however, provide the emperor with another daughter, Flaccilla,
in 431, and possibly a son, Arcadius, who died in infancy.<b><a href="#N_10_">[[10]]</a></b>
By the late 430s, relations with her husband had deteriorated to the point
that she sought his leave to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in the company
of Melania, a wealthy and pious widow from the West. Evidently there was
no more hope of the birth of a male heir to the throne.<b><a href="#N_11_">[[11]]</a></b>
Eudocia's tour of the east in 438 was a success. She visited all the holy
sites and made a huge impression; the scene of her kneeling before the
tomb of Christ was reproduced on the wall of a church in Constantinople
after her return. Her learned address to the people of Antioch won huge
acclaim too; a bronze statue to her was erected outside the Museum of the
city.<b><a href="#N_12_">[[12]]</a></b> Her return to Constantinople in
439, armed with further relics for the capital, brought a brief resurgence
of her influence: it is possible that the brilliant career of the poet
Cyrus, who at one point in the 440s occupied the posts of praetorian and
urban prefect simultaneously, was assisted in some measure by the empress.<b><a href="#N_13_">[[13]]</a></b>
But it was not to last. In 443 the eunuch <i>spatharius</i> Chrysaphius
engineered the departure of Eudocia from the capital by having her accused
of adultery with Paulinus, a good-looking friend of the emperor (who had
earlier been accused of sexual relations with the virgin <b><a href="pulcheria.html">Pulcheria</a></b>
by Nestorius). Paulinus was banished to Cappadocia and executed in the
following year. The empress for her part departed for Jerusalem once again.<b><a href="#N_14_">[[14]]</a></b>
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>Eudocia was never to return to the imperial capital. Even in Jerusalem,
her situation worsened almost as soon as she arrive: <b><a href="theo2.html">Theodosius
</a></b>despatched the <i>comes domesticorum</i> Saturninus to execute
two of her confidants, the priest Severus and the deacon John. According
to Holum, '[n]ot to be outdone in brutality, Eudocia struck Saturninus
down with her own hands', reporting the brief entry of the chronicler Marcellinus
about the episode. If this is indeed the meaning of Marcellinus' text,
Eudocia's strength and determination were indeed remarkable. More likely,
however, it was members of her entourage who assassinated Saturninus; as
a consequence, the emperor deprived her of her household, although she
retained the title of Augusta.<b><a href="#N_15_">[[15]]</a></b> Eudocia
retained her wealth and influence, however, and continued to be surrounded
by literary figures. It was probably in this period that she took part
in the composition of the <i>Homerocentones</i>, biblical stories moulded
to fit Homeric verse. These verses survive, as does her eight-book poem
recounting the martyrdom of St Cyprian. The quality of her literary work
has not found general favour with modern scholars, however: in the words
of Alan Cameron, 'Eudocia cannot but seem uncouth and ignorant - and that
without the redeeming virtue of freshness and simplicity.'<b><a href="#N_16_">[[16]]</a></b>
At her palace in Bethlehem and in Jerusalem she continued to receive petitions
and sought to alleviate the persecution of the Jews, in spite of the unpopularity
of such a stance. With her wealth she endowed the city of Jerusalem with
a new set of walls and erected numerous other buildings throughout the
Near East.<b><a href="#N_17_">[[17]]</a></b> In the wake of the Council
of Chalcedon, called by <b><a href="theo2.html">Theodosius' </a></b>successor
<b><a href="marcian.html">Marcian</a></b> in collaboration with his wife
<b><a href="pulcheria.html">Pulcheria</a></b>, Eudocia placed herself firmly
on the side of the local populace, which fiercely opposed the Council's
decisions, perceived as being too close to Nestorianism. The chronicler
Theophanes, followed in this by the much later church historian Nicephorus
Callistus Xanthopulus, claims that she aligned herself with the eunuch
Chrysaphius in backing the archimandrite Eutychius, whose views were upheld
by the `Robber Council' at Ephesus in 449 but then condemned by Chalcedon;
his evidence is suspect, however, since Nicephorus at least seems to believe
that she was still in Constantinople at this time, whereas, as we have
seen, she had already been forced by Chrysaphius' machinations to return
to Palestine in the early 440s.<b><a href="#N_18_">[[18]]</a></b> Throughout
her time in Palestine, it is clear that she was a well known figure, thoroughly
immersed in local ecclesiastical issues.<b><a href="#N_19_">[[19]]</a></b>
Although troops had to intervene to restore order in the region, the Augusta
herself did not suffer any reprisals. Two years later, distressed at the
sufferings of her family in the West, where her daughter and her children
had been taken captive by the Vandal king Geiseric, she accepted the decisions
of the Council, having taken the preliminary step of consulting the local
holy man, Symeon the Stylite. Despite this, the anti-Chalcedonian church
(often called 'Monophysite') continued to regard her as a champion of its
cause.<b><a href="#N_20_">[[20]]</a></b> She died on 20 October 460 in
Jerusalem, where she was buried in the church of St Stephen.<b><a href="#N_21_">[[21]]</a></b>

she was from Antioch rather than Athens. Whitby 2000, 48 n.173, prefers

</p><p><a name="N_2_"></a>[[2]]We pass over the romantic tales surrounding
Theodosius' decision to marry Eudocia, which implausibly associate Pulcheria
with the selection of the girl. As we might expect of any fairy-tale princess,
she is described by Malalas (XIV.4) as 'a very good-looking young woman,
refined, with a good figure, eloquent, from Hellas, a virgin and the daughter
of a philosopher' (tr. Jeffreys and Scott), who naturally therefore caught
the attention of the emperor. For a full discussion see Holum 1982, 112-20.

at Athens).
</p><p><a name="N_8_"></a>[[8]]See Fowden 1995, 562 with Alexander 1967, lines
91-3 and notes at 80-2. Alexander reports also that four cities of Asia
Minor were renamed Eudocias in honour of the empress. Cameron 1982, 278,
notes that she also began work on the basilica of St Lawrence in Constantinople,
in which were placed the relics of St Stephen which she brought back with
her in 439 from Jerusalem. It was Pulcheria, however, who completed work
on the basilica, shortly before her death in 453. Whether this needs to
be taken as implying `co-operation' between the two empresses, as Cameron
argues (1982, 278), may be doubted. See also Holum 1982, 196.

Holum 1982, 193, places it in 443, as does <i>PLRE</i> II. Kennedy 2000,
607, however, states that she was in Jerusalem from 441, and this date
is also preferred by Sironen 1999, 436. Argumentation for this earlier
date is provided by Cameron 1982, 258-63; see also Hunt 1982, 235-6.

s.a.444.4, tr. by Croke 1995, 18. See Holum 194 for the quotation. Blockley
1983, 388 n.86, discussing Saturninus, assumes that it was 'at the order'
of Eudocia that the count was killed; this seems also to be the interpretation
of Croke, <i>op. cit.</i>, 87. Marcellinus himself found the empress' ferocity
surprising, describing her as being 'spurred on by some grief or other'
(<i>nescio quo excita dolore</i>).

Nor did she neglect secular buildings: she restored the Baths of Valens

baths at Gadara.
