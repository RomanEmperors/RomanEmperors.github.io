<p>While the ever-expanding breadth of the Perseus Project renders it useful for

pedagogy, to what depths can a scholar delve into this digital library?  Perseus is

rapidly acquiring rich new data -- image and text -- from museums, Web

collaborations, and the digitization of traditional text resources. Simultaneously its

staff is developing standards and tools to help scholars mine the data more

effectively. Navigational tools within a digital library consist of three broad

categories: search options, the interconnection of discrete objects, and access to

further resources. This paper discusses techniques used to optimize these

navigational tools.</p>

<p>Although users are now given many ways to access data in Perseus -- a user-driven

table of contents, an image browser, and even maps and QTVR walkthroughs--the

word search tool remains the primary way to access data. But the word search is

only as good as the underlying data. It can barely come up with the variety of names

given to one hero or place. Similarly, how can a search engine make distinctions

between the many ancient individuals and places that share names?  We are

currently reworking the ontological basis for our data, so that the search tool should

in the future be able to distinguish  between people and places, places in different

regions, and so on. The ontology should also serve as a source of keywords and thus

a separate research tool.</p>

<p>&gt;Hypertext links are the basic advantage of a digital versus a conventional library.

Some connections rely on thoughtful database design, as in the case of our sculpture

database. But automatically generated links between discrete texts are improved

with a good ontology. When comparanda, ancient and modern texts, and Greek and

Latin words are included in the archaeology databases, they must also be tagged so

that relevant links will be generated. Further resources may be accessed only if the

data is consistent or thorough, with, for example, standardized bibliographic

citations.</p>

<p>For many years desktop geographic information systems (GIS) have been a useful

means of organizing, retrieving, and querying data through visual geospatial query.

More recently groups such as the Open GIS Consortium have composed a set of

standard data formats and functionalities for porting GIS to the Internet. Perseus is

adopting GIS data and mapping standards and implementing a web GIS as a portal

to the historical and cultural materials in its various databases.</p>



<p>This paper will discuss the implementation of a geographic information system

component for the Perseus Digital Library and the way in which geographic

information system standards can help provide new ways of accessing information in

Perseus and the web in general. The aim of implementing a GIS for the Perseus web

site is to unify our own disparate classes of data (i.e. literary sources, papyri,

inscriptions, maps, plans, and object collections) while allowing for integration and

sharing of data with other digital library projects. City level topography provides the

test-bed for the Perseus GIS.</p>



<p>Because topographical landscapes of cities, such as Rome or the Roman port city of

Ostia, change over time, maps linked to geospatial data provide good interfaces for

users to access entire collections of data through geospatial and temporal query. This

kind of interface provides visual ways of posing the questions of "what?", "where?"

and "when?". For example, a useful query might be phrased "What resources in

Perseus can illustrate the changes in the topography of Ostia from the first century

BCE through the first century CE?" or "generate a map of features in the Roman

Forum in 14 BCE".</p>



<p>In developing interactive map interfaces that are linked to geographic and temporal

databases, we can begin to address the complex spatial questions that students and

researchers ask of ancient material culture. We can also provide easier access to the

information that pertains to these questions.</p>

<p><strong><span class="text-2xl">The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and the Giza Pyramids"</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span class="text-2xl">Peter Der Manuelian</span></strong></p>



<p><span class="text-2xl">Museum of Fine Arts, Boston</span></p>

<p>Between 1905 and 1942, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, excavated the Egyptian

cemeteries (Old Kingdom, Dynasties 4-6, ca. 2630-2250 BC) surrounding the

famous Giza Pyramids outside of modern Cairo. The Museum anticipates integrating

a portion of the expedition's thousands of artifacts, archaeological maps, plans,

drawings, field diaries and glass plate photographic negatives into a fully searchable,

online research tool on the Internet ("the Giza Archives Project"). In addition,

returning MFA expeditions to Giza have recently been experimenting with digital

and immersive photography in and around the tombs of the necropolis. QTVR and

IPIX immersive panoramas are supplementing the original excavation materials from

the early 1900s, making the site accessible to scholars in a variety of new ways.

Moreover, "digital epigraphy," or the production of facsimile line drawings of tomb

wall decoration using high resolution scanned images and vector drawing software,

is streamlining the documentation process. The ability to download and print vector

(instead of simple bitmap) illustrations right from the Internet using formats such as

Flash, hold great promise for the future. Both the projected Giza Archives Project

website and the MFA's continuing print publications (the Giza Mastabas Series,

vols. 1-7) will be summarized and discussed.</p>

<p><strong><span class="text-2xl">"Spacing Out: Web 3D and the Reconstruction of Archaeological Sites"</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span class="text-2xl">Thomas L. Milbank</span></strong></p>



<p><span class="text-2xl">Perseus Project</span></p>



<p><span class="text-2xl">Tufts University</span></p>



<p>The emergence of high-speed processors with 3D graphics acceleration and the

accessibility of high-speed internet connections have propelled web 3D from a

frustrating to a viable internet technology. Without a doubt, the addition of spatial

dimension to customary 2D web graphics can be visually gripping. But greater

potential for the technology lies beyond its ability to command attention. Web 3D

presents students and scholars alike with a new tool for visualizing and

understanding ancient sites. Fundamentally, 3D digital reconstruction allows

architecture, sculpture, and other remains to be considered in their respective

contexts as a whole, rather than as individual items divorced from their intended

settings. At the same time, digital reconstruction can incorporate a distinction

between the "real" and the "hypothetical" just as found in other types of modern

restoration work.   </p>

<p>The Perseus Project is currently preparing 3D models of various archaeological

sites. These will be linked to other related materials already in its digital library:

maps; plans; photographs; QTVR walkthroughs; site, architecture, and object

catalogs; and literary and historical documents. In part, the models are intended as

databases of geographic and architectural information in their own right. They are

also intended to serve as the underpinning for a contextual presentation of

architectural and freestanding sculptures. This paper surveys Perseus' work on the

Apollo sanctuary at Delphi. It addresses both the process of digital modeling and the

method used integrate to the model with Perseus' existing tools and databases.</p>

<p><strong><span class="text-2xl">"Images as Content and Interface: QTVR and Image Cataloging in a Digital Library"</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span class="text-2xl">Genevieve Gessert</span></strong></p>



<p><strong><span class="text-2xl">                                                      Yale University</span></strong></p>

<p>This paper will discuss conceptual and technical aspects of images in on-line

publication, using the Perseus digital library as a case study. As electronic

publication evolves swiftly from a novelty to a commonplace, scholars can now

publish not just a few representative images, but instead entire archives of visual

materials. Without the costs of print publication, and aided by the growing

sophistication of tools like digital cameras, scanners, and drafting software, we can

reasonably consider including all relevant images in on-line resources. This

development is particularly dramatic in the field of archaeology, where excavations

such as the Hacimusalar Project in southwestern Turkey can publish every

photograph and drawing from a field season almost as quickly as these visual

resources are created.</p>

<p>With this opportunity for more extensive publication of images, however, come the

twin responsibilities of image cataloging for scholarly value, and technical standards

for longevity. A discussion of the evolving standards for image cataloging and

archiving at the Perseus Project will illuminate some of these responsibilities, and

highlight the importance of long-term planning in image capture, storage, and

delivery.</p>

<p>Beyond the treatment of images as content lies the relatively unexplored territory of

using the images themselves as interface. Technologies such as QuickTime Virtual

Reality (QTVR) can transform photographs into portals, interconnecting the images

of a place, object, or structure with catalog data, bibliography, commentary, or even

video or audio clips. Recent Perseus QTVR work at the Museum of Fine Arts,

Boston, the Roman site of Ostia, and the American historical sites at Lowell,

Plimoth Plantations, and the Paul Revere House will demonstrate new directions in

using images as interface.</p>

<p>Electronic publication brings an unprecedented audience to educational materials

that have been difficult, traditionally, for people outside of academia to use. With

careful cataloging and innovative use of images as an access point into their

research, scholars have an opportunity to disseminate their knowledge to this

audience in a newly compelling way.</p>

<p>Effective visuals are vitally important to the study of classical archaeology.

Photographs, illustrations, drawings, and computer-generated content are often

essential for the careful delivery of archaeological concepts, particularly to those

with limited knowledge or experience in the field. Therefore, as we attempt to

educate others by electronic means, such visual content can become even more

important as students without the means for field experience attempt to understand

basic archaeological concepts.  The need then for quality visual content raises

several new challenges when considering the limitations of web delivery. Due to

bandwidth issues, the delivery of rich visual content can be quite slow, creating a

significant delay and cognitive fragmentation. This of course, creates a trade-off

between quality content and the realities of the effective web-based delivery of such

content.  There are technological solutions of varying levels of success for this issue,

however. By considering bit depth as well as varying compression options,

modifications can be made to electronic images that will enable them to load more

quickly.  This presentation will illustrate specific technical methods for creating

smaller graphic images for web delivery. This will enable participants to develop

smaller images with nearly the same level of quality, which will in turn, aid them in

the development of better web-based materials for the study of classical

archaeology. Given the prevalence of Adobe PhotoShop as a graphic development tool, 

we will focus our examples on this application.</p>

<p>An important step in the transition from codex-based archaeology to digital

archaeology is the use of visualization and presentation techniques that take

advantage of what cannot be done on paper, such as the use of moving images,

sounds, and hyperlinks. Digital archaeology, especially one that takes full advantage

of the World Wide Web, need not depend upon the visualization tools, linear format,

or two-dimensional display methods of past archaeological reporting. Java, virtual

reality, and computer animations can all be seamlessly integrated into the basic

methods of disseminating archaeological data. The shortcomings of traditional

paper-based archaeological reporting include: limits on number of images; limits on

types of images; limits on size of images; prescriptive, static, and linear

presentation; the difficulty of updating the data, ideas, and images; packaging costs;

mailing costs; warehousing costs; and the expensive of production per unit of data

published.</p>

<p>Electronic reporting, integrating the Internet, can overcome these and other

profession-wide barriers to information because it can: reduce the long time lag

between data gathering and data dissemination; provide more information, more

creatively, to more people; vastly increase the amount of data that can be included in

a publication; increase the options for visual presentation of the data; and provide

hyperlinked presentations and customizable search and retrieval formats.</p>

<p>We intend to demonstrate some of those advantages through discussion of two

VirtualSiteMuseum(TM) projects: the Northwest Palace of Ashur-nasir-pal II

(Ancient Nimrud, Assyria) Digital Publication Prototype and the Central Palace of

Tiglath-pileser III -- the Final Report of the Polish Center of Archaeology's

Excavation at Ancient Nimrud, Assyria. A team of archaeologists and architects

from the United States and Poland are working with Learning Sites, Inc., to create

massive research resources based on virtual reality re- creations of the Palaces as

they were excavated and as they have been digitally reconstructed. The virtual

models have links to drawings, photographs, descriptive and analytical text, and

high-resolution renderings of the building complexes. The projects will also include

intelligent agents, virtual Assyrians acting as virtual site interpreters that will be able

to answer user queries about the Palaces. The results will be published both on

DVD and on the Internet, for integration of live updates, distance education features,

and links to new information as they arise. Access to Internet and the technologies

of the Immersidesk(TM) and CAVE(TM) are also planned. Issues of future data

format standards and conversion, archiving, peer review, and authorship guidelines

will also be discussed.</p>

<p>I propose to talk about the materials I've put on the web to accompany the Wheelock

Latin book. A couple of things about it go a little beyond the ordinary and could

prove illustrative of interesting problems facing authors of web materials. The first is

that the web site itself complicated my tenure case -- is it a publication? It also made

it a little more difficult to find a "real" publisher when the time came for a second

edition to take into account the changes in the Wheelock text. Secondly, I found

myself ahead of the university's ability to support some of the materials technically.

For instance, I wanted to create streamed discussions of the answered tutorials in the

back of the book, but our university server didn't have, and still doesn't have, a

streaming program. Not being terribly skilled in information technology, I

nevertheless managed to assemble a streaming server from my office computer using

freeware. I could briefly describe the process. (If I can do it, anyone can.)  Here are

the sites I'll discuss: </p>

<p><span class="text-2xl">and Rachel Kapelle</span></p>

<p>To improve language instruction in an Old English class that is required to be "at

least 50% literature" we have developed "King Alfred", a web-based tool that allows

students to practice, at their own convenience and pace, translating Old English

sentences. We see King Alfred as an example of the next generation of web-based

instructional tools. A majority on-line references are forms of "brochure ware,"

using the cost-savings power of the web to disseminate material that would work

just as well in print form (in fact, King Alfred's grammar book is exactly this sort of

web-based tool). But King Alfred is in fact truly interactive:  The program

remembers and analyzes a student's work and provides individually customized

feedback. This "mass customization" is the new paradigm for web-based tools, and

holds out the promise of making the study of ancient and medieval languages and

cultures more accessible to more students.</p>

<p>King Alfred provides a student with a sentence in Old English and a "scratch pad"

line where he or she can type a working translation. After making an attempt to

translate the sentence without help, the student requests assistance from the

program. King Alfred provides a hyperlinked set of words in the sentence, and the

student can click on any word he or she does not understand. King Alfred presents a

list of the word's potential linguistic characteristics (part of speech, number, gender,

case, tense, mood, definition, etc.) that the student can work through. The program

keeps track of each help request. When the student has determined, with King

Alfred's help, exactly what each element in each sentence is doing syntactically and

semantically, he or she can finalize the translation in the "scratch pad" line. King

Alfred then provides a translation of the Old English that the student can use to

determine the quality of his or her translation. After the student has translated a

number of sentences, the program, using various algorithms, prioritizes three

grammatical areas for the student to review in the form of hyperlinks to the relevant

sections of the grammar. King Alfred also provides students with a list of vocabulary

words for which they requested definitions or translations. King Alfred is also

designed to keep control in the hands of the individual classroom teacher. Sentences

can be entered by individuals with no expertise at all in computer programming or

web design. From the teacher's point of view King Alfred provides for increased

feedback. From the student's point of view the program makes learning Anglo-Saxon

less of an exercise in flipping through lexicons or grammar book chapters and more

of an intellectual engagement with language, culture, and ideas. </p>

specific steps taken to increase the information available to students of Classical

Studies. The Faculty of Classics has made a major investment in Information

Technology Systems both via Intranet and with respect to WWW interface. The

faculty has appointed a classical scholar as Faculty Web Advisor to act as a liaison

between the full-time technical officer and classical scholars. The primary task of

the Web Advisor is to evaluate and upgrade the Web resources and make them more

easily accessible by students and non-professionals as well as scholars. Three linked

web sites are maintained: the Faculty, the Classical Library, and the Museum of

Classical Archaeology. The Faculty web site has a dedicated Links Gateway page,

organized around the Faculty's caucus system: Literature, Philosophy, History, Art /

Archaeology, Linguistics and General, the latter reserved for studies that do not fit

easily into one of the other categories, e.g., reception studies and modern Greek.

The caucus divisions are augmented with a series of topics that are not transparently

part of a specific caucus, e.g., numismatics, epigraphy and palaeography. This

organization reflects the nature of classical studies as an integrated discipline that

can be approached from various perspectives using specialized skills. Internally,

used in conjunction with the Faculty Intranet and Databases, every student can

access from his college, the Faculty or his college room resources such as TLG and

Perseus, and graduate students are afforded mainframe space for the storage of

research. Externally those not associated with the University have increased access

to information from the Web. The sheer volume of materials has made necessary a

disciplined approach to evaluating what is to be included in the links.</p>

<p>Georgia posses a rich cultural heritage, an important part of which comes from the

Medieval period. Especially significant is the ecclesiastical cultural heritage of the

period, among which Christian icons represent a notable part. The idea of the project

is to create an electronic register for Georgian icons, by which is meant Christian

icons preserved on Georgian territory. In order to accomplish this all icons (an

estimated 4000) must be indexed, on the basis of which an electronic database will

be set up. The objective of the project is to make information about Georgian icons

accessible for researchers and interested parties and persons in Georgia and all over

the world. Within the frame of this project all icons, which are published and/or

mentioned in scientific publications, should be indexed and described using a unified

questionnaire. The majority of Georgian icons have been published and reliably

dated in scholarly publications (in Georgian and other languages) from the

nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In order to ensure that all relevant information

can be included we have looked into various possibilities for electronic cataloguing.

Our aim is to structure the catalogue in an easily accessible way enabling scholars to

identify the particular icon images. The most obvious solution would appear to be

SGML (Standard Generalized Mark-up Language), either using the EAD (Encoded

Archival Description) or TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) implementations. While

EAD has certain advantage over TEI, it was designed especially for archival

material. We think that the TEI will provide the best long-term solution.

Unfortunately, although some work has been done in this area, at present there is no

accepted standard for data of this kind. These images can be linked to marked-up

texts, making it easier to read the texts and enabling searches of various kinds.</p>

<p>The <i>Thesaurus Musicarum Latinarum</i> (TML), a full-text database of Latin music

theory opened to the public in late 1990, currently offers in machine-readable form

more than 4.6 million words of text, accompanied by more than 4,500 graphics. The

TML includes all the Latin texts in the collections of Gerbert and Coussemaker; in

such series as Greek and Latin Music Theory, Divitiae musicae artis, Corpus

scriptorum de musica, and the Colorado College Music Press; in individual editions

published in journals and by various publishers; and in more than eighty-one

manuscripts. The texts are distributed world-wide free of charge on the Internet and

can be searched and displayed on any type of machine--a mainframe, Macintosh, a

machine running DOS or Windows, and so on. The database is also available,

together with the Gregorian-chant database CANTUS, on CD-ROM for a nominal

charge.</p>

<p>Each month on average, the TML web site is accessed more than 1100 times and

responds to more than 265 searches. Since 1997 (the year in which the TML web

site replaced the old TML Gopher), the site has been accessed more than 29,000

times and has responded to more than 6,500 searches. Meanwhile, the TML-FTP

and TML LISTSERV have delivered more than154,000 files since 1995.    In this

presentation, the various operations of the database, including text searching, display

of graphics, and appearance of the database on the World Wide Web (emulated on

the CD-ROM) will be demonstrated, followed by a discussion of the design and

background structure of the database and its servers. Printed materials pertaining to

the TML will be distributed.</p>

<p>The World Wide Web is often spoken of in terms of "promise."  Now that the Web

is no longer entirely new, it is time to ask how well it is delivering on that promise,

how well it works as a scholarly medium. Who uses scholarly web sites?  What do

they like about those sites? How many users are academic or independent scholars,

how many are students, and how many are general readers?   This paper investigates

these questions by drawing on the author's experience in administering a

general-purpose scholarly site on Late Antiquity. </p>

<p>It is of course individual researchers who generate scholarly information: editions,

commentaries, studies, interpretations, lexica, bibliographies, data- collections,

reports, handbooks, and further sorts. But it is likewise in large part these same

researchers who form the principal user-group for these same 'commodities'

(regardless of publication format). A peculiar kind of marketplace, this -- where

producer and consumer are in fact one and the same party, collectively viewed. </p>

<p>The line of communication should then be uncomplicated, one might say (or at any

rate, wish). But the reality has for a very long time been -- and necessarily so -- quite

otherwise. Intermediaries enough: filterers, validators, packagers, marketers,

distributors, vendors, more filterers, systematizers, access providers, and -- not to

forget -- funders and subsidizers. They all make their own, understandable,

contributions to bringing together the scholar as producer, and the scholar (and his

or her student) as user, of reliable information.</p>

<p>But couldn't we in fact better do without all these 'outside' parties? Isn't the Web

going to make that at last possible? A dream come true? Or, perhaps, an

unrealistically simplistic scenario? This presentation considers these questions, and

suggests that it is not in the interest of the 'academic enterprise' that the

&lt;i&gt;functionalities&lt;/i&gt; of intermediation mentioned above should disappear or be

circumvented. In that sense, the transition from print to digital era need not (I would

even say, is hardly likely to) ring in any widespread simplification in the 'knowledge

chain'.</p>

<p>By the same token, the <i>form</i>, the organization, to some extent the

<i>visibility</i>, of intermediation will have to change -- but that process is already

well underway, probably further than many are aware. And what we <i>call</i> the

intermediary parties is not so important. A number of the essential functions which

the "library" now performs (some of them old, some new) are for example no less

important in the Internet than in the print world -- as administrators and funders too

have recognized -- whether or not the word "library" itself may later come to be

used only to designate a sort of book-museum.</p>

<p>The presentation also gives attention, in the context of intermediation, to: </p>

<p>- the increasing complexity of preparing and sustaining www-based access to  

(proprietary) scholarly resources -- based on the experiences of the speaker's   own

organization; </p>

<p>- the increasing significance of psychological/communicative factors in 

information services (including the demonstrated differences among the 

various academic disciplines, and between different kinds of scholars); </p>

<p>- the important role played by the differences between the students of the  past and

those of the future -- particularly important since in fact it is the students who are the

principal subsidizers of the scholarly enterprise and the critical link to the social

context in which we function. </p>

<p>The Stoa Consortium aims to promote collaborative scholarship,

published on line and freely available to other scholars and general

readers.  As a publisher, we must provide the mechanisms for making

these scholarly works available.  As an on-line publisher, we intend

to provide more than what a good print publisher can provide:

electronic texts can be explicitly connected as books cannot.</p>



<p>A digital library project generally produces and controls its own

texts and images.  This makes it relatively easy to interconnect those

resources.  A digital publisher, on the other hand, does not produce

texts itself, and indeed the works published under its auspices need

not all live on the same computer system.  Interconnection in this

environment requires more explict co-operation by the authors and

editors of the text:  specifically, use of the same markup rules.</p>



<p>Markup for us means SGML or XML, conforming to the TEI DTD and

following Stoa conventions for which features to mark, which values to

use for certain attributes, and which meta-data to include in the

document header.  We have found that most scholars wishing to publish

texts with us do not know SGML in general, or this DTD in particular.

Although they quickly see the benefits of structured markup, they must

learn the language and the local idiom.  The first piece of publishing

infrastructure, then, is support for markup: documentation, editing

software, and validators.</p>



<p>Many authors also want detailed control over the appearance of their

work.  They expect, sometimes unconsciously, that the technology of

the Web as it exists today is and will be the final, best way to

publish their work.  While we prefer to take a longer-term, more

general view, we recognize that on-line publication today does in fact

mean the Web.  The second piece of infrastructure is display

formatting, whether for the Web, for printing, or for some future

delivery medium.</p>



<p>The third piece of infrastructure is interconnection, which is what

makes on-line publication fundamentally different from print.

Interconnection means that references to other objects, outside the

text, can automatically be hyperlinked to those objects.  The typical

digital library model is that objects within the library can be

hyperlinked to each other, while objects outside are not linked.

Since the digital publishing house does not "contain" its texts, on

the other hand, there is no reason for it to restrict these reference

connections to only works it has published itself.  The Stoa has

developed a reference database that allows any work published by the

Stoa to refer to any resource elsewhere on the Internet.  Hyperlinks

are generated when the text is displayed, which means they are always

as current as the content of the database.</p>



<p>The Stoa's tool set will be made available as open-source software, and

we hope that other on-line publishers and digital libraries may wish

to share reference information.</p>

"Bringing Athenian Democracy to 21st Century Readers"</span></p>

<p>D mos: Classical Athenian Democracy is a demonstration project of The Stoa,

a consortium for scholarly electronic publication in the humanities. The

goal of D mos is to give a broad audience a level of access to Classical

Athenian Democracy that has hitherto been available only to professional

classicists and ancient historians. D mos will present a core of articles on

the institutions, concepts, places, and people of Athenian democracy. These

articles will be firmly and obviously based on the primary sources. Our

readers will have direct access to these sources, in Greek and in

translation. D mos will not merely serve up the text of the sources which,

in the absence of context, will mean little to a audience unfamiliar with

ancient history  but will provide, along with the text, descriptions of the

source s genre, its author, and the work from which it comes.</p>



<p>The overall goal is to provide articles that meet the highest standards of

scholarship without excluding non-professional readers, who will have

immediate access to the sources and to the context necessary to evaluate

those sources critically.</p>

<p>

In addition to the core of descriptive articles linked to primary sources,

D mos will include other, interpretive or argumentative articles,

representing new scholarship on Athenian democracy. These will also be held

to a high standard, but will be aimed at inviting a broad public to explore

the ongoing study of Athenian democracy.</p>



<p>The technology behind this project poses the most significant challenge for

us collaborators in this project. We will need to link many different kinds

of electronic documents together, in different ways under different

circumstances; we will need to ensure that new documents can be integrated

seamlessly into D mos, and that other projects can easily interact with

D mos. We will answer these challenges with a combination of: data in

structured documents, TEI-conformant SGML, server-side scripting to deliver

the SGML to as HTML, and authority lists to mediate between significant

terms (citations, names, geographic places) and databases of texts, atlases,

and other resources both inside and outside of D mos.</p>



<p>This approach, though, present its own challenges for a collaborative, open

project like D mos. A site like the Perseus Project, which employs similar

technologies, is designed, implemented, and maintained by a staff of full

time scholars with extraordinary technological skills. D mos, to be

effective and durable, will have to be accessible to scholars with ordinary

technological skills. Accordingly, the editors of the Stoa Consortium   Ross

Scaife and Anne Mahoney   are working in collaboration with the Perseus

Project to design a system and develop tools that will allow individual

authors to create, mark, review, and integrate their own documents into the

infrastructure of D mos.</p>

<p>The Suda On-Line project was begun in early 1998 with a simple

goal:  using the World-Wide Web to compile and disseminate a collaborative

annotated translation of the Suda lexicon.  In pursuit of that goal the

project has developed an increasingly sophisticated interface for users and

contributors and has evolved into a unique experiment in electronic

publishing in Classics. Though we have been actively recruiting translators

for just under a year now, over 110 scholars world wide have signed on to

work on it and (as of 8/1/00) well over 2000 entries have been submitted.

In order to maximize the advantages of Web publication we have developed an

unusual editorial policy:  draft submissions are made available immediately

on the project's Web site, and their improvement and annotation is carried

out in a transparent process that is visible to all users of the site.</p>

<p>A problem often faced by the members of an academic discipline

is how to find the most comprehensive, up-to-date, and authoritative  

information about an important topic in one's discipline. If one wants an  

introduction to a topic that is organized by an expert, a summary of the  

current state of research, or a bibliography of print and online works that has  

been filtered on the basis of informed human judgment, there are few places to  

turn other than standard reference works.  But standard reference works go out  

of date even before they are published and aren't responsive to advances in  

research.

</p>

<p>In response to this problem, we have developed and implemented the

concept of a `dynamic reference work'.  The Stanford Encyclopedia

of Philosophy (https://plato.stanford.edu/) is a dynamic reference work

in which each entry is written and maintained by an expert or group of experts  

in the field, and the authors can update their entries at any time to reflect  

advances in research.  However, the entries and subsequent updates are not made  

publically available on the web until they are refereed by the members of an  

Editorial Board.  Dynamic reference works therefore require a highly customized  

work-flow system, mediated by password-protected web interfaces through which  

authors and editors can conduct such transactions as uploading and  

remotely-editing entries, refereeing entries, comparing updated entries with  

originals, etc.  In this

way, a dynamic reference work organizes an academic discipline so that

it can collaboratively maintain an up-to-date reference work.

<p>The project's core work consists in the digitization of ancient and early modern texts

on mechanical theory and practice and in research utilizing these digitized texts. 

The project differs from most other digital libraries in that it also provides an

environment for creation of content in the form of commentary, which is in turn

made available in the library. The project is now at the point where we are ready to

attempt the creation of an integrated workplace. We have completed a lengthy pilot

phase, in which we tested a variety of data formats, workflows, and software

solutions. My contribution has been to design the work flow for the new workplace,

and in particular to write a set of guidelines which will coordinate the work of

taggers, programmers and scholars.</p>

<p>In particular, my paper will address problems arising from the division of sgml labor

between taggers and scholars working on highly structured primary texts: how can a

tagger encode text structure so as to make it available for scholarly research, without

at the same time either second-guessing the scholar as to what the structure of the

text might be or forcing the scholar, who may know little about sgml, to change the

tagging of the text itself when s/he detects an error in the structure encoded by the

tagger? When changes have to be made, how can they be added to the text most

effectively?</p>

<p>Up until the present day, electronic documents have tended to mirror their physical

counterparts with respect to form as well as content. In the mindset of most editors

and typesetters, such documents have only a single layer of information since this is

all that can be produced on a piece of paper. On paper there is no possibility for

providing the reader with different content levels, as it is an inherently two-dimensional means of presentation.</p>

<p>With the release of the 4.0 versions of Netscape and Internet Explorer, 'Dynamic

HTML' - page content generated on-the-fly - has become a real possibility. We can

now transcend the old self-imposed two dimensional restrictions and add a facility

for presenting information of various kinds not only across and down the page, but

up out of it as well. This allows us to produce documents that are to traditional

documents what holograms are to photographs.</p>

<p>The proposed paper will present a working model using the Pierpont Morgan

Library's "A" redaction manuscript of Book 1 of Froissart's 'Chroniques' (a 14th

Century chronicle). This will be used to explore the implications of this new

technology for the conceptualisation and development of electronic editions of

manuscripts from any era of history.</p>

<p><span class="text-2xl">University of California -- Berkeley</span></p>

<p>This paper will discuss the development of an electronic version of the UCLA Indo-European Studies Bulletin, a test case for online publication using two new

technological standards, XML and Unicode. The IES Bulletin is a small scholarly

publication devoted to ancient Indo-European languages (including Greek and Latin)

and the archaeological remains associated with the IE cultures. The project was

developed in conjunction with the Electronic Text Unit from the UC Berkeley

Library (with seed-funding from Bryn Mawr Reviews) as a way of seeing what

kinds of problems arise in creating such an electronic publication using XML and

Unicode, the solutions that are available, and whether e-publication is a viable

alternative to print publication.</p>

<p>The impetus for this project was twofold:</p>



<p>--The field of ancient Indo-European studies is one that requires access to a number

of small publications that are often difficult (or impossible) to find in libraries. Does

electronic publication better suit the field? The Bulletin could itself serve as a case

study for other small scholarly publications in ancient and medieval studies. XML

was chosen as it is becoming the new standard for the Web and allows searching

capabilities better than other e-publishing options (i.e., PDF).</p>



<p>--Because the IES Bulletin includes a wide variety of ancient and modern scripts, it

is critical that these scripts display correctly on the Web, independent of computer

platform. Unicode, the universal encoding standard, is intended to solve this

problem, but not all languages have been accepted and many software products do

not yet support it. What can be done in the interim? What can be done to adequately

cover the fonts needed, i.e., is a downloadable font the answer, or embedded fonts?</p>

<p><i>The Medieval Review</i> (TMR) is a book review journal, run in much the same way as a

 print review journal, with the difference that we do almost all 

of our correspondence by e-mail.  Instead of printing reviews in groups, 

we send each one out as e-mail to all the electronic subscribers of the 

distribution list, as soon as we have received and edited it.  The electronic medium is 

ideally suited to book reviews, which, since they are not that long, can easily be 

read as e-mail.  Once they have been posted, reviews are archived on a web site; they 

can be browsed by the date of their appearance, or searched by author, 

title, or keyword.</p>

<p>This talk will consider the issues we encounter, and the advantages we 

enjoy, by running a journal electronically.  Advantages include:  speed, 

no length limits, the potential to include images, and availability to 

anyone with a web connection (not just people in scholarly libraries).  Our major 

issue has to do with costs:  currently both the subscription list and the website are 

free, but we do incur costs which must be met.  We are in the process of experimenting 

with various ways to raise revenue without passing the costs along to the readers, 

and some of these are possible specifically because of the electronic

 format.</p>

<p><strong><span class="text-2xl">SESSION X: Integrating Archaeological Field Work via the WWW</span></strong></p>



<p><span class="text-2xl">Sunday, 9:45-12:00 </span></p>

<p><span class="text-2xl">Organizer: Neel Smith (College of the Holy Cross) </span></p>

<p>Archaeologists working in the field record vast quantities of observations that cannot

be replicated, and that offer only indirect evidence for the true subject of

archaeology:  human activity in the past.  Small wonder that field archaeologists

have often been early adopters of information technologies such as databases,

geographic information systems and text markup languages.  The World Wide Web

now challenges us to move beyond applying information technologies to isolated

components of a field project, and reconceive a field project's information system as

an integrated whole.  A unified information system more closely reflects the

continuity of activity that should ideally characterize the collaborative activity of

fieldwork.  Our presentations describe how we are addressing that challenge in

practice in the Turkish-American field work at Hacimusalar (ancient Choma, in

Lycia).*We highlight four ways that delivering information over the WWW changes

our activities as archaeologists.</p>

<p>1) Easy delivery of information widens the SCOPE of material we can consider.  To

take one example, each season we shoot thousands of photographs.  Shot in film,

these might be available only as contact sheets:  digital photographs are available on

our web server the same day as thumbnails linked to full-size images.  A field

director trying to review activity across a large site now has constant access to a

complete photographic archive.</p>

<p>2) The Web changes WHO has access to material.  We find, for example, that

students on the dig now routinely refer to the photographic documentation

mentioned above -- material that would have been unavailable to them

without the Web. In like fashion, the same data archives can now support specialist

publications, more general publicity like newsletters, and pedagogical or educational

materials.  There are still distinct audiences for these different types of publications,

but they are no longer cut off from fuller information.  Perhaps the most dramatic

example in the Hacimusalar project is the use of excavation archives normally

inaccessible to all but project members in a collaborative, on-line archaeology

course offered through the Associated Colleges of the South, and coordinated with

courses at DePauw and Holy Cross.</p>

<p>3) A unified information system fights isolation along traditional disciplinary

boundary lines.  Using distribution maps automatically generated from queries over

the Web, archaeologists studying ceramics can explore the relation of their material

to finds of bones studied by faunal specialists.  Specialists can explore the work in

progress of other team members, and so in their own work better take account of

other contributions to the project.</p>

<p>4) A unified information system encourages collaboration.  The Hacimusalar project

includes participants from a dozen institutions in the U.S. and Turkey.  Beginning in

the 1999 field season, we set up a small local network with a Web server for team

members to use during the field season in Turkey.  Following the season, this Web

server was then connected to the internet, where team members can continue to

work with and develop their materials, while simultaneously making them available

to other team members, archaeologists elsewhere, students and the broader public.

Participants in the 2000 field season can work with new material as it comes on line,

before ever getting to the project site in Turkey.</p>

<p>The Hacimusalar Project, a multidisciplinary archaeological project centered on the

Elmali basin in southwestern Turkey,  is conducted by Bilkent University (Ankara) in

conjunction with the Associated Colleges of the South, DePauw University and the

College of the Holy Cross.  The participants in this panel would like to thank the

director of the project, Dr. Ilknur Ozgen (Bilkent University), for making this

collaboration possible.</p>

<p>Dr. Garrison, the field director of the Hacimusalar project, will introduce the

session. The WWW changes how the field director meets the entire range of his

professional responsibilities, from daily decision making in the field, to fund-raising,

outreach and professional publication.</p>

<p><span class="text-2xl">Director of Technology for the ACS</span></p>



<p><span class="text-2xl">Associated Colleges of the South.</span></p>

<p>Dr. Bonefas describes the development of an innovative on-line archaeology course

based on the Hacimusalar project.  During class meetings, students follow class

material on the WWW while logged into a chat room, where they can post questions

to the lecturer, whose talk is simultaneously broadcast in RealAudio.  This allows

students at small schools without an archaeologist to take part in a course that would

otherwise be unavailable to them.</p>

<p><strong><span class="text-2xl">"The Classification and Chronology of Ceramics Using the WWW"</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span class="text-2xl">Hal Haskell</span></strong></p>



<p><span class="text-2xl">Southwestern University</span></p>

<p>Since most of the pottery found at Hacimusalar consists of little studied or unknown

wares, Prof. Haskell is working out the basic classification and chronology of

ceramics from the site.  Working on the WWW, he is developing a wide range of

interlinked material.  To support his original scholarly interpretations, he is able to

provide direct links into the project archives;  he is also writing handbooks for

students working at the site.  These, too, include links into archival material as well

as to his own conclusions.</p>

<p><span class="text-2xl">DePauw University</span></p>

<p>The Hacimusalar Survey uses an integrated data strategy to digitally 

manage all of the project's media and information. While this strategy works seamlessly 

for internal analysis by project members, the larger question is how we will share 

this information with other projects in a way such that survey results can be 

compared, and supra-regional settlement patterns can be explored and explained. 

The WWW offers a medium through which the data can move, but data which originates

 in highly complex relational databases must be made available in a clear, workable way, 

and there must be significant points of comparability with other projects. This 

suggests that survey archaeologists should be discussing methodological and recording 

standards as well as technical standards -- a difficult task, considering the 

uniqueness of each region and the individual questions of the researchers. 

And yet, the WWW may be the solution here as well, by allowing survey 

archaeologists to develop such standards outside of 

conferences and publications.</p>

<p>Creating a unified information system requires the collaboration of all team

members, and coordinated planning.  Since 1998, Prof. Smith's primary

responsibility on the Hacimusalar project has been the integration of information

technologies in the field. His presentation will outline how databases, geographic

information systems and structured text are served from a WWW server, and why

we have chosen to rely on open-source software.</p>

<p><span class="text-2xl">Centre College </span></p>

<p>The Ancient Civilizations Distance Learning Program brings the excitement and the

experience of archaeology in Greece directly to students in the United States. This

program builds on the OSU Excavations at Isthmia Web Site

(https://isthmia.ohio-state.edu/) and Multimedia Program as well as electronic

resources from long-term archaeological exploration in Greece, by making them

available to students from several institutions throughout the country. </p>

<p>This initiative cannot, of course, replace a direct international field experience in

classical archaeology, but it can provide the resources and some of the "flavor" of an

archaeological expedition. The program makes use of a variety of integrated

technologies, including digital video, electronic databases, text-based and

photographic resources, ancillary Internet material, and e-mail interactions along

with web-based discussion boards. The goal of the program is not simply to provide

resources, but to allow students at their home institutions to take part in the

experience of working and learning at an archaeological site in Greece. The program is innovative and modular, so that its various parts can be used 

by teachers in different courses such as ancient history, classical archaeology,

classical mythology, history of art, and Modern Greek culture, among others. </p>

<p>This presentation will discuss the nature of the project as well as demonstrating the

electronic materials. Some limited data from the first year of implementation will

also be available. </p>
