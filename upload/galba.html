<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The evidence for the principate of Galba is unsatisfactory.  The sources either concentrate on the
personality of the man, thereby failing to offer a balanced account of his policies and a firm
chronological base for his actions; or, they focus on the final two weeks of his life at the expense
of the earlier part of his reign.<a href="#N_1_"><b>[[1]]</b></a>  As a result, a detailed account of his principate is difficult to write.  Even so, Galba is noteworthy because he was neither related to nor adopted by his predecessor
<a href="nero.html"><b>Nero</b></a>.  Thus, his accession marked the end of the nearly century-long control of the Principate by
the Julio-Claudians.  Additionally, Galba's declaration as emperor by his troops abroad set a 
precedent for the further political upheavals of 68-69.  Although these events worked to Galba's
favor initially, they soon came back to haunt him, ending his tumultuous rule after only seven
months.  </p>
<h3>Early Life and Rise to Power </h3>
<p>Born 24 December 3 BC in Tarracina, a town on the Appian Way 65 miles south of Rome,
Servius Galba was the son of C. Sulpicius Galba and Mummia Achaica.<a href="#N_2_"><b>[[2]]</b></a>  Galba's connection
with the noble house of the Servii gave him great prestige and assured his acceptance among the
highest levels of Julio-Claudian society.   Adopted in his youth by Livia, the mother of the
emperor <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>, he is said to have owed much of his early advancement to her.<a href="#N_3_"><b>[[3]]</b></a>  Upon her
death, Livia made Galba her chief legatee, bequeathing him some 50 million sesterces.  <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>,
Livia's heir, reduced the amount, however, and then never paid it.  Galba's marriage proved to be a
further source of disappointment, as he outlived both his wife Lepida and their two sons.  Nothing
else is known of Galba's immediate family, other than that he remained a widower for the rest of
his life.</p>
<p>Although the details of Galba's early political career are incomplete, the surviving record is one of
an ambitious Roman making his way in the Emperor's service.  Suetonius records that as praetor
Galba put on a new kind of exhibition for the people - elephants walking on a rope.<a href="#N_4_"><b>[[4]]</b></a>  Later, he
served as governor of the province of Aquitania, followed by a six-month term as consul at the
beginning of 33.<a href="#N_5_"><b>[[5]]</b></a>  Ironically, as consul he was succeeded by Salvius Otho, whose own son
would succeed Galba as emperor.  Over the years three more governorships followed - Upper
Germany (date unknown), North Africa (45) and Hispania Tarraconensis, the largest of Spain's
three provinces (61).  He was selected as a proconsul of Africa by the emperor <a href="claudius.html"><b>Claudius</b></a> himself
instead of by the usual method of drawing lots.  During his two-year tenure in the province he
successfully restored internal order and quelled a revolt by the barbarians.  As an imperial legate
he was a governor in Spain for eight years under <a href="nero.html"><b>Nero</b></a>, even though he was already in his early
sixties when he assumed his duties.  The appointment showed that Galba was still considered
efficient and loyal.<a href="#N_6_"><b>[[6]]</b></a>  In all of these posts Galba generally displayed an enthusiasm for 
old-fashioned <i>disciplina</i>, a trait consistent with the traditional characterization of the man as a
hard-bitten aristocrat of the old Republican type.  Such service did not go unnoticed, as he was
honored with triumphal insignia and three priesthoods during his career.  </p>
<p> On the basis of his ancestry, family tradition and service to the state Galba was the most
distinguished Roman alive (with the exception of the houses of the Julii and Claudii) at the time of
<a href="nero.html"><b>Nero's</b></a> demise in 68.  <a name="Note 2"></a>The complex chain of events that would lead him to the Principate later that
year began in March with the rebellion of Gaius Iulius Vindex, the governor of Gallia
Lugdunensis.  Vindex had begun to sound out provincial governors about support for a rebellion
perhaps in late 67 or early 68.  Galba did not respond but, because of his displeasure with
Neronian misgovernment, neither did he inform the emperor of these treasonous solicitations. 
This, of course, left him dangerously exposed; moreover, he was already aware that <a href="nero.html"><b>Nero</b></a>, anxious
to remove anyone of distinguished birth and noble achievements, had ordered his death.<a href="#N_7_"><b>[[7]]</b></a> 
Given these circumstances, Galba likely felt that he had no choice but to rebel.</p>
<p>In April, 68, while still in Spain, Galba "went public," positioning himself as a<i> vir militaris</i>, a
military representative of the senate and people of Rome.  For the moment, he refused the title of
Emperor, but it is clear that the Principate was his goal.  To this end, he organized a <i>concilium</i> of
advisors in order to make it known that any decisions were not made by him alone but only after
consultation with a group.  The arrangement was meant to recall the Augustan Age relationship between the
emperor and senate in Rome.  Even more revealing of his imperial ambitions were legends like
<i>LIBERTAS RESTITUTA</i> (Liberty Restored), <i>ROM RENASC</i> (Rome Reborn) and <i>SALUS
GENERIS HUMANI</i> (Salvation of Mankind), preserved on his coinage from the period.  Such
evidence has brought into question the traditional assessment of Galba as nothing more than an
ineffectual representative of a bygone <i>antiquus</i> rigor in favor of a more balanced portrait of a
traditional constitutionalist eager to publicize the virtues of an Augustan-style Principate.<a href="#N_8_"><b>[[8]]</b></a>  </p>
<p>Events now began to move quickly.  <a name="Note 3"></a>In May, 68 Lucius Clodius Macer, legate of the <i>III legio Augusta</i> 
in Africa, revolted from Nero and cut off the grain supply to
Rome.  Choosing not to recognize Galba, he called himself <i>propraetor</i>,
issued his own coinage, and raised a new legion, the <i>I Macriana
liberatrix</i>. Galba later had him executed.  At the same time, 68 Lucius Verginius Rufus, legionary commander in
Upper Germany, led a combined force of soldiers from Upper and Lower Germany in defeating
Vindex at Vesontio in Gallia Lugdunensis.  Verginius refused to accept a call to the emperorship
by his own troops and by those from the Danube, however, thereby creating at Rome an
opportunity for Galba's agents to win over <a href="sabinus.html"><b>Gaius Nymphidius Sabinus</b></a>, the corrupt praetorian
prefect since 65. <a href="sabinus.html"><b> Sabinus</b></a> was able to turn the imperial guard against <a href="nero.html"><b>Nero</b></a> on the promise that
they would be rewarded financially by Galba upon his arrival.  That was the end for <a href="nero.html"><b>Nero</b></a>. 
Deposed by the senate and abandoned by his supporters, he committed suicide in June.  At this
point, encouraged to march on Rome by the praetorians and especially by <a href="sabinus.html"><b>Sabinus</b></a>, who had his
own designs on the throne, Galba hurriedly established broad-based political and financial support
and assembled his own legion (subsequently known as the <i>legio VII Gemina</i>).<a href="#N_9_"><b>[[9]]</b></a>  As he departed
from Spain, he abandoned the title of governor in favor of "Caesar," apparently in an attempt to
lay claim to the entire inheritance of the Julio-Claudian house.  Even so, he continued to proceed
cautiously, and did not actually adopt the name of Caesar (and with it the emperorship) until
sometime after he had left Spain.<a href="#N_10_"><b>[[10]]</b></a>    </p>
<h3>The Principate of Galba</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, Rome was anything but serene.  An unusual force of soldiers, many of whom had
been mustered by <a href="nero.html"><b>Nero</b></a> to crush the attempt of Vindex, remained idle and restless.  In addition,
there was the matter concerning <a href="sabinus.html"><b>Nymphidius Sabinus</b></a>.  Intent on being the power behind the
throne, <a href="sabinus.html"><b>Nymphidius</b></a> had orchestrated a demand from the praetorians that Galba appoint him sole
praetorian prefect for life.  The senate capitulated to his pretensions and he began to have designs
on the throne himself.  In an attempt to rattle Galba, <a href="sabinus.html"><b>Nymphidius</b></a> then sent messages of alarm to
the emperor telling of unrest in both the city and abroad.  When Galba ignored these reports,
<a href="sabinus.html"><b>Nymphidius</b></a> decided to launch a coup by presenting himself to the praetorians.  The plan misfired,
and the praetorians killed him when he appeared at their camp.  Upon learning of the incident,
Galba ordered the executions of <a href="sabinus.html"><b>Nymphidius'</b></a> followers.<a href="#N_11_"><b>[[11]]</b></a>  To make matters worse, Galba's
arrival was preceded by a confrontation with a boisterous band of soldiers who had been formed
into a legion by <a href="nero.html"><b>Nero</b></a> and were now demanding legionary standards and regular quarters.  When
they persisted, Galba's forces attacked, with the result that many of them were killed.<a href="#N_12_"><b>[[12]]</b></a>  </p>
<p>Thus it was amid carnage and fear that Galba arrived at the capital in October, 68, accompanied by
<a href="otho.html"><b>Otho</b></a>, the governor of Lusitania, who had joined the cause.  Once Galba was within Rome,
miscalculations and missteps seemed to multiply.   First, he relied upon the advice of a corrupt
circle of advisors, most notably: Titus Vinius, a general from Spain; Cornelius Laco, praetorian
prefect; and his own freedman, Icelus.  Second, he zealously attempted to recover some of <a href="nero.html"><b>Nero's</b></a>
more excessive expenditures by seizing the property of many citizens, a measure that seems to
have gone too far and to have caused real hardship and resentment.  Third, he created further 
ill-will by disbanding the imperial corps of German bodyguards, effectively abolishing a tradition that
originated with Marius and had been endorsed by <a href="auggie.html"><b>Augustus</b></a>.  Finally, he seriously alienated the
military by refusing cash rewards for both the praetorians and for the soldiers in Upper Germany
who had fought against Vindex.  </p>
<p>This last act proved to be the beginning of the end for Galba.  On 1 January 69 the troops in
Upper Germany refused to declare allegiance to him and instead followed the men stationed in
Lower Germany in proclaiming their commander, <a href="vitell.html"><b>Aulus Vitellius</b></a>, as the new ruler.  In response,
Galba adopted Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi Licinianus to show that he was still in charge and that
his successor would not be chosen for him.  Piso, although an aristocrat, was a man completely
without administrative or military experience.<a href="#N_13_"><b>[[13]]</b></a>  The choice meant little to the remote armies,
the praetorians or the senate, and it especially angered <a href="otho.html"><b>Otho</b></a>, who had hoped to succeed Galba. 
<a href="otho.html"><b>Otho</b></a> quickly organized a conspiracy among the praetorians with the now-familiar promise of a
material reward, and on 15 January 69 they declared him emperor and publicly killed Galba; Piso,
dragged from hiding in the temple of Vesta, was also butchered. </p>
<h3>Assessment</h3>
<p>In sum, Galba had displayed talent and ambition during his lengthy career.  He enjoyed
distinguished ancestry, moved easily among the Julio-Claudian emperors (with the exception of
<a href="nero.html"><b>Nero</b></a> towards the end of his principate), and had been awarded the highest military and religious
honors of ancient Rome.  His qualifications for the principate cannot be questioned.  Even so, history has 
been unkind to him.  Tacitus characterized Galba as "weak and old," a man
"equal to the imperial office, if he had never held it."  Modern historians of the Roman world have
been no less critical.<a href="#N_14_"><b>[[14]]</b></a>  To be sure, Galba's greatest mistake lay 
in his general handling of the
military.  His treatment of the army in Upper Germany was heedless, his policy towards the
praetorians short sighted.  Given the climate in 68-69, Galba was unrealistic in expecting <i>disciplina</i>
without paying the promised rewards.  He was also guilty of relying on poor advisors, who
shielded him from reality and ultimately allowed <a href="otho.html"><b>Otho's</b></a> conspiracy to succeed.  Additionally, the
excessive power of his henchmen brought the regime into disfavor and made Galba himself the
principal target of the hatred that his aides had incited.  Finally, the appointment of Piso, a young
man in no way equal to the challenges placed before him, further underscored the emperor's 
isolation and lack of judgment. In the end, the instability of the post-Julio-Claudian political landscape offered challenges more
formidable than a tired, septuagenarian aristocrat could hope to overcome.  Ironically, his regime
proved no more successful than the Neronian government he was so eager to replace.  Another
year of bloodshed would be necessary before the Principate could once again stand firm. </p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p><a name="N_1_"></a>[[1]] The main ancient sources for Galba's life are: Suet. <i>Galba</i>; Tac. <i>Hist.</i> 1.1-49; Plut. <i>Galba</i>; Dio
63.22-64.7.  In addition, there were major works for this period by Cluvius Rufus, Fabius
Rusticus and Pliny the Elder, but they have not survived.  For an important discussion, see G. B.
Townsend, "Cluvius Rufus in the Histories of Tacitus," <i>AJPhil</i> 85 (1964): 337-377. </p>
<p><a name="N_2_"></a>[[2]] Galba's birthdate is impossible to determine.  Suetonius give it as 24 December, 3 B.C. (<i>Galba</i>
4.1), yet in the final chapter of Galba's Life, he presupposes 5 B.C. as the date (<i>Galba</i> 23).  Dio
(64.6.52), taken with Tacitus' evidence (Hist. 1.27.1), also gives his birthdate as 5 B.C.  The
evidence given here is preferable, since Suetonius provides the information precisely and is
concerned with Galba's actual birthdate, not the length of his life or his reign.  </p>
<p><a name="N_3_"></a>[[3]] Suet. <i>Galba</i> 4.  This must be a testamentary adoption, since a woman in classical law was not
allowed to adopt during her lifetime.  See the commentary of Charles L. Murison, editor, <i>Suetonius:
Galba, Otho, Vitellius</i> (London, 1991), 33.  </p>
<p><a name="N_4_"></a>[[4]] Suetonius' claim that Galba was the first to offer an exhibition of rope-walking elephants has
been refuted.  See J. M. C. Toynbee, <i>Animals in Roman Life and Art</i> (London, 1973), 48-49, 352
nn. 103-110.  See also H. H. Scullard, <i>The Elephant in the Greek and Roman World</i> (London,
1974), 250-259.</p>
<p><a name="N_5_"></a>[[5]] This governorship is slightly unconventional, since most <i>nobiles</i> in this period usually governed
senatorial provinces as praetorian proconsuls, not important imperial provinces like Aquitania. 
Galba was perhaps being groomed for a career as a <i>vir militaris</i>.  Regarding the consulship, there
may have been a delay at some point in Galba's accession to the office.  For a more complete
discussion on this point, see Charles L. Murison, <i>Galba, Otho and Vitellius: Careers and
Controversies</i> (Hildesheim, 1993), 35-36.</p>
<p><a name="N_6_"></a>[[6]] On Galba's behavior in Spain, see Suet. <i>Galba</i> 9 and Murison,<i> Careers and Controversies</i>,
37-38.  Galba's eight-year term, although lengthy, was not unprecedented.  The time spent by an
imperial legate as a provincial governor was entirely at the discretion of the emperor. </p>

<i>Careers and Controversies</i>, 31-44.</p>
<p><a name="N_9_"></a>[[9]] To obtain the necessary financing Galba confiscated and sold all of Nero's property in Spain
(Plut. <i>Galba </i>5.6) and received a large amount of gold and silver from Otho (Plut. <i>Galba</i> 20.3).  He
also seems to have demanded contributions from communities in Spain and Gaul.  See Tac. <i>Hist</i>.

<p><a name="N_13_"></a>[[13]] Piso Licinianus was the son of M. Licinius Crassus Frugi, consul in 27, and of Scribonia, a
direct descendant of Pompey the Great.  He was only about eight years old when his parents and
eldest brother were executed as part of the senatorial opposition to the later Julio-Claudians. 
Tacitus records that he was <i>diu exul</i> (<i>Hist.</i> 1.48.1; cf. <i>Hist</i>. 1.21.1; 1.38.1), which would explain
