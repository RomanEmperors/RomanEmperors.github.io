<p><b>Introduction and Sources</b></p></center>

<p>The five Julio-Claudian emperors are very different one from the other.
<b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
dominates in prestige and achievement from the enormous impact he had upon
the Roman state and his long service to Rome, during which he attained
unrivaled <i>auctoritas</i>. <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>
was clearly the only possible successor when <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
died in AD 14, but, upon his death twenty-three years later, the next three
were a peculiar mix of viciousness, arrogance, and inexperience. <b><a href="gaius.html">Gaius</a></b>,
better known as Caligula, is generally styled a monster, whose brief tenure
did Rome no service. His successor <b><a href="claudius.hrm">Claudius</a></b>,
his uncle, was a capable man who served Rome well, but was condemned for
being subject to his wives and freedmen. The last of the dynasty, Nero,
reigned more than three times as long as <b><a href="gaius.html">Gaius</a></b>,
and the damage for which he was responsible to the state was correspondingly
greater. An emperor who is well described by statements such as these,
"But above all he was carried away by a craze for popularity and he was
jealous of all who in any way stirred the feeling of the mob." and "What
an artist the world is losing!" <b><a href="#N_1_">[[1]] </a></b>and who
is above all remembered for crimes against his mother and the Christians
was indeed a sad falling-off from the levels of <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
and <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>. Few will argue that Nero
does not rank as one of the worst emperors of all.
</p><p>The prime sources for Nero's life and reign are Tacitus' <i>Annales</i>
12-16, Suetonius' <i>Life of Nero</i>, and Dio Cassius' <i>Roman History</i>
61-63, written in the early third century. Additional valuable material
comes from inscriptions, coinage, papyri, and archaeology.
</p><center>
<p><b>Early Life</b></p></center>

<p>He was born on December 15, 37, at Antium, the son of Cnaeus Domitius
Ahenobarbus [[<i>PIR<sup>2</sup></i> D127]]and Agrippina [[<i>PIR<sup>2
</sup></i>I641]].
Domitius was a member of an ancient noble family, consul in 32; <b><a href="aggieii.html">Agrippina</a></b>
was the daughter of the popular <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b>
[[<i>PIR<sup>2
</sup></i>I221]], who had died in 19, and <b><a href="aggiei.html">Agrippina</a></b>,
daughter of Agrippa, <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus' </a></b>closest
associate, and<b><a href="julia.html"> Julia</a></b>, the emperor's daughter,
and thus in direct descent from the first <i>princeps</i>. When the child
was born, his uncle <b><a href="gaius.html">Gaius</a></b> had only recently
become emperor. The relationship between mother and uncle was difficult,
and <b><a href="aggieii.html">Agrippina</a></b> suffered occasional humiliation.
But the family survived the short reign of the "crazy" emperor, and when
he was assassinated, it chanced that <b><a href="aggieii.html">Agrippina's
</a></b>uncle,
<b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius,</a></b>
was the chosen of the praetorian guard, although there may have been a
conspiracy to accomplish this.
</p><p>Ahenobarbus had died in 40, so the son was now the responsibility of
<b><a href="aggieii.html">Agrippina</a></b>
alone. She lived as a private citizen for much of the decade, until the
death of<b><a href="valmess.html"> Messalina</a></b>, the emperor's wife,
in 48 made competition among several likely candidates to become the new
empress inevitable. Although Roman law forbade marriage between uncle and
niece, an eloquent speech in the senate by Lucius Vitellius [[<i>PIR</i>
V500]], <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius'</a></b> closest advisor in
the senatorial order, persuaded his audience that the public good required
their union. <b><a href="#N_2_">[[2]]</a></b> The marriage took place in
49, and soon thereafter the philosopher Seneca [[<i>PIR<sup>2</sup></i>
A617]] was recalled from exile to become the young Domitius' tutor, a relationship
which endured for some dozen years.
</p><p>His advance was thereafter rapid. He was adopted by <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>
the following year and took the name Tiberius Claudius Nero Caesar or Nero
Claudius Caesar Drusus Germanicus, was preferred to Claudius' natural son,
<b><a href="britty.html">Britannicus</a></b>
[[<i>PIR<sup>2</sup></i> C820]], who was about three years younger, was
betrothed to the emperor's daughter
<b><a href="octavia.html">Octavia</a></b>,
and was, in the eyes of the people, the clear successor to the emperor.
In 54, <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b> died, having eaten some
poisoned mushrooms, responsibility for which was believed to be <b><a href="aggieii.html">Agrippina's</a></b>,
<b><a href="#N_3_">[[3]]</a></b>
and the young Nero, not yet seventeen years old, was hailed on October
13 as emperor by the praetorian guard.
</p><center>
<p><b>The first years of rule</b></p></center>

<p>The first five years of Nero's rule are customarily called the <i>quinquennium</i>,
a period of good government under the influence, not always coinciding,
of three people, his mother, Seneca, and Sextus Afranius Burrus [[<i>PIR<sup>2</sup></i>
A441]], the praetorian prefect. The latter two were allies in their "education"
of the emperor. Seneca continued his philosophical and rhetorical training,
Burrus was more involved in advising on the actualities of government.
They often combined their influence against <b><a href="aggieii.html">Agrippina</a></b>,
who, having made her son emperor, never let him forget the debt he owed
his mother, until finally, and fatally, he moved against her.
</p><p>Nero's betrothal to <b><a href="octavia.html">Octavia</a></b> [[<i>PIR<sup>2
</sup></i>C1110]]
was a significant step in his ultimate accession to the throne, as it were,
but she was too quiet, too shy, too modest for his taste. He was early
attracted to <b><a href="poppaea.html">Poppaea Sabina</a></b> [[<i>PIR<sup>2</sup></i>
P850), the wife of <b><a href="otho.html">Otho</a></b>, and she continually
goaded him to break from <b><a href="octavia.html">Octavia
</a></b>and to
show himself an adult by opposing his mother. In his private life, Nero
honed the musical and artistic tastes which were his chief interest, but,
at this stage, they were kept private, at the instigation of Seneca and
Burrus.
</p><p>As the year 59 began, Nero had just celebrated his twenty-first birthday
and now felt the need to employ the powers which he possessed as emperor
as he wished, without the limits imposed by others. <b><a href="poppaea.html">Poppaea's</a></b>
urgings had their effect, first of all, at the very onset of the year,
with Nero's murder of his mother in the Bay of Naples.
</p><p><b><a href="aggieii.html">Agrippina</a></b> had tried desperately to
retain her influence with her son, going so far as to have intercourse
with him. But the break between them proved irrevocable, and Nero undertook
various devices to eliminate his mother without the appearance of guilt
on his part. The choice was a splendid vessel which would collapse while
she was on board. As this happened, she swam ashore and, when her attendant,
having cried out that <i>she</i> was <b><a href="aggieii.html">Agrippina</a></b>,
was clubbed to death, <b><a href="aggieii.html">Agrippina </a></b>knew what
was going on. She sent Nero a message that she was well; his response was
to send a detachment of sailors to finish the job. When she was struck
across the head, she bared her womb and said, "Strike here, Anicetus, strike
here, for this bore Nero," and she was brutally murdered. <b><a href="#N_4_">[[4]]</a></b>
</p><p>Nero was petrified with fear when he learned that the deed had been
done, yet his popularity with the <i>plebs</i> of Rome was not impaired.
This matricide, however, proved a turning point in his life and principate.
It appeared that all shackles were now removed. The influence of Seneca
and Burrus began to wane, and when Burrus died in 62, Seneca realized that
his powers of persuasion were at an end and soon went into retirement.
<b><a href="britty.html">Britannicus</a></b>
had died as early as 55; now
<b><a href="octavia.html">Octavia</a></b> was
to follow, and Nero became free to marry<b><a href="poppaea.html"> Poppaea</a></b>.
It may be that it had been Burrus rather than <b><a href="aggieii.html">Agrippina</a></b>
who had continually urged that Nero's position depended in large part upon
his marriage to <b><a href="octavia.html">Octavia</a></b>. Burrus' successor
as commander of the praetorian guard, although now with a colleague, was
Ofonius Tigellinus [[<i>PIR<sup>2</sup></i> O91]], quite the opposite of
Burrus in character and outlook. Tigellinus became Nero's "evil twin,"
urging and assisting in the performance of crimes and the satisfaction
of lusts.
</p><center>
<p><b>Administrative and foreign policy</b></p></center>

<p>With Seneca and Burrus in charge of administration at home, the first
half-dozen years of Nero's principate ran smoothly. He himself devoted
his attention to his artistic, literary, and physical bents, with music,
poetry, and chariot racing to the fore. But his advisors were able to keep
these performances and displays private, with small, select audiences on
hand. Yet there was a gradual trend toward public performance, with the
establishment of games. Further, he spent many nights roaming the city
in disguise, with numerous companions, who terrorized the streets and attacked
individuals. Those who dared to defend themselves often faced death afterward,
because they had shown disrespect for the emperor. The die was being cast
for the last phases of Nero's reign.
</p><p>Abroad there were continuous military and diplomatic difficulties, first
in Britain, then in the East involving Parthia and Armenia, and lastly
in Judaea. The invasion of Britain had begun in 43 and that campaign continued
for four years. But the successive governors had the task of consolidating
what had been conquered and adding to the extent of the province. This
involved some very vicious fighting, particularly in the west against the
Silures and the Ordovices. In the year 60 the great explosion occurred.
When the governor, Suetonius Paullinus [[<i>PIR</i> S694]], was attacking
the island of Mona, modern Anglesey, to extirpate the Druids, Boudica,
the queen of the Iceni, located chiefly in modern Norfolk, rose in revolt,
to avenge personal injuries suffered by herself and her daughters and to
expel Rome from the island. Her army destroyed three Roman cities with
the utmost savagery, Colchester, London, and St. Albans falling to sword
and fire. But Paullinus met the enemy horde at a site still unknown and
destroyed the vastly larger British forces. <b><a href="#N_5_">[[5]]</a></b>
Nero is said to have considered giving up the province of Britannia because
the revenue it produced was far lower than had been anticipated about a
score of years before, and it cost Rome more to maintain and expand the
province than the latter was able to produce. Yet, at the last, Nero decided
that such an action would damage Rome's prestige enormously, and could
be interpreted as the first of a series of such actions. The <i>status
quo</i> therefore remained. <b><a href="#N_6_">[[6]]</a></b>
</p><p>The problem in the East was different. Parthia and Rome had long been
rivals and enemies for preeminence in the vast territory east of Syria
and Cappadocia. The key was Armenia, the land which separated the two great
powers. It served as a buffer state; the important issue in the minds of
both concerned the ruler of Armenia. Was he to be chosen by Rome or by
Parthia, and thereby be considered the vassal of one or the other? In the
latter fifties there were frequent disagreements which led to war, fought
viciously and variously. Rome suffered some significant losses, until Cn.
Domitius Corbulo [[<i>PIR<sup>2</sup></i> D142]]was appointed governor
of Syria and made commander of all military forces. He won the day by diplomacy
as much as by force of arms. The upshot was that the man chosen for the
Armenian throne came to Rome to be crowned by Nero with enormous panoply
and display.
</p><p>The year 66 saw the beginning of an uprising in Judaea which was brutal
in the extreme. The future emperor <b><a href="vespasia.html">Vespasian</a></b>
was appointed to crush the rebels, which he and his son Titus were able
to accomplish. Four legions were assigned to Judaea; the neighboring province
of Syria, under its governor Mucianus, also possessed four. This was a
mighty military muster in a relatively small part of the empire.
</p><center>
<p><b>The great fire at Rome and the punishment</b>
<br><b>of the Christians</b></p></center>

<p>The year 64 was the most significant of Nero's principate up to this
point. His mother and wife were dead, as was Burrus, and Seneca, unable
to maintain his influence over Nero without his colleague's support, had
withdrawn into private life. The abysmal Tigellinus was now the foremost
advisor of the still young emperor, a man whose origin was from the lowest
levels of society and who can accurately be described as criminal in outlook
and action. Yet Nero must have considered that he was happier than he had
ever been in his life. Those who had constrained his enjoyment of his (seemingly)
limitless power were gone, he was married to <b><a href="poppaea.html">Poppaea</a></b>,
a woman with all advantages save for a bad character <b><a href="#N_7_">[[7]]</a></b>,
the empire was essentially at peace, and the people of Rome enjoyed a full
measure of <i>panem et circenses</i>. But then occurred one of the greatest
disasters that the city of Rome, in its long history, had ever endured.
</p><p>The fire began in the southeastern angle of the Circus Maximus, spreading
through the shops which clustered there, and raged for the better part
of a week. There was brief success in controlling the blaze, but then it
burst forth once more, so that many people claimed that the fires were
deliberately set. After about a fortnight, the fire burned itself out,
having consumed ten of the fourteen Augustan regions into which the city
had been divided.
</p><p>Nero was in Antium through much of the disaster, but his efforts at
relief were substantial. Yet many believed that he had been responsible,
so that he could perform his own work comparing the current fate of Rome
to the downfall of Troy. All his efforts to assist the stricken city could
not remove the suspicion that "the emperor had fiddled while Rome burned."
He lost favor even among the <i>plebs</i> who had been enthusiastic supporters,
particularly when his plans for the rebuilding of the city revealed that
a very large part of the center was to become his new home.
</p><p>As his popularity waned, Nero and Tigellinus realized that individuals
were needed who could be charged with the disaster. It so happened that
there was such a group ready at hand, Christians, who had made themselves
unpopular because of their refusal to worship the emperor, their way of
life, and their secret meetings. Further, at this time two of their most
significant "teachers" were in Rome, Peter and Paul. They were ideal scapegoats,
individuals whom most Romans loathed, and who had continually sung of the
forthcoming end of the world.
</p><p>Their destruction was planned with the utmost precision and cruelty,
for the entertainment of the populace. The venue was Nero's circus near
the Mons Vaticanus. Christians were exposed to wild animals and were set
ablaze, smeared with pitch, to illuminate the night. The executions were
so grisly that even the populace displayed sympathy for the victims. Separately,
Peter was crucified upside down on the Vatican hill and Paul was beheaded
along the Via Ostiensis. But Nero's attempt, and hope, to shift all suspicion
of arson to others failed. His popularity even among the lower classes
was irrevocably impaired. <b><a href="#N_8_">[[8]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b>City planning, architecture, and literature</b></p></center>

<p>The devastation in the center of the city presented an opportunity for
Nero to build a mansion worthy of himself, the vast estate known as the
"Golden House," the <i>domus aurea</i>. It consisted of a very extensive
residential quarter, with numerous architectural innovations, a lake, and
a colossal statue of himself. In subsequent years, all were destroyed or
transformed. The Golden House was filled in and served as the foundation
of <b><a href="trajan.html">Trajan's</a></b> baths, the lake disappeared
under the Colosseum, the <i>amphitheatrum Flavium</i>, and the statue's
head was changed to that of a divinity. The entire project was a huge example
of Roman building techniques and imagination. Indeed, the architects responsible,
Severus and Celer, <b><a href="#N_9_">[[9]]</a></b> are the first in Roman
history whose names are known. <b><a href="#N_10_">[[10]]</a></b>
</p><p>There is little else of importance in the field of architecture. Nero
did have other grand plans, such as cutting a canal through the Isthmus
of Corinth in Greece, but they did not come to fruition.
</p><p>The situation was different in the arts and literature. Nero considered
himself a virtuoso in music, acting, chariot racing, and literary activity,
to the point that he could not tolerate any rivals. In competitions, it
was routine that he always won, and those compelled to attend his performances
were faced with execution if they did not evince appropriate attention
and enthusiasm. The future emperor <b><a href="vespasia.html">Vespasian</a></b>
fell asleep on more than one such occasion but was spared.
</p><p>We know essentially nothing about Nero's competitors in other fields,
but in literature there were substantial rivals. Chief among them was Lucan,
whose epic on the Caesarian civil war evoked the majesty, in subject and
manner, of Vergil. Lucan offended Nero by criticism of the latter's poetry
and was forbidden to recite his own work. Seneca was the other great figure
of the literary age, but his specialities of philosophy and rhetoric did
not appeal to the emperor. Pliny the Elder similarly devoted himself to
works of massive scope, such as his <i>History of the German Wars</i> and
the <i>Natural History</i>, which defied competition from the emperor.
</p><center>
<p><b>A failed conspiracy</b></p></center>

<p>The year 65 was marked by a conspiracy of a large scale, the purpose
of which, it goes without saying, was to eliminate Nero and replace him
with a member of the senatorial order. <b><a href="#N_11_">[[11]]</a></b>
The chosen designee was C. Calpurnius Piso [[<i>PIR<sup>2 </sup></i>C284]],
although there was talk that Seneca was the favorite of many. The conspiracy
failed, in part because there were too many people involved in it and some,
by action or word, caused suspicion which Tigellinus ruthlessly pursued.
Once it was broken, leading members of society behaved miserably and dishonorably,
squealing on others and facing their own ends with fear and shame. Only
two persons who were tortured or put to death behaved in the fashion of
an "old Roman," and these were members of the lower classes. A freedwoman
Epicharis, after torture had not succeeded in breaking her resistance,
committed suicide by hanging herself before a second day of interrogation.
<b><a href="#N_12_">[[12]]</a></b>
Subrius Flavus, a tribune of the praetorian guard, was the only person,
as reported by Tacitus, who bluntly spoke when Nero asked him why he had
ignored his oath as a soldier and acted against him.
</p><p>"I hated you, yet not a soldier was more loyal to you while you deserved
to be loved. I began to hate you when you became the murderer of your mother
and your wife, a charioteer, an actor, and an incendiary." <b><a href="#N_14_">[[13]]</a></b>
</p><p>Flavus' judgment of Nero essentially expressed the views of subsequent
history. Among the other deaths were those of Piso and Seneca by suicide.
</p><p>Nero was now twenty-seven years old. He had been emperor for more than
a decade and had overseen or been responsible for three major disasters
in the space of little more than one year. The only positive result from
any of these was the imposition of strict building laws for the reconstruction
of the city, calling for wider streets, a limitation on the height of buildings,
and the use of safer building materials. Though Rome became a healthier
and more attractive city, resentment remained because Nero had taken for
his own use such a large part of the central city and had brought the countryside
into the city. Yet Nero's response to these challenges was to devote ever
more attention to his artistic leanings, in ever more public contexts.
First there came an extended visit to Naples, the most Greek city of Italy,
then a trip to Greece, where he participated in each of the great festivals
and won hundreds of contests. Who, after all, would dare vote against the
man who held the power of life and death over all? <b><a href="#N_14_">[[14]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b>The end - Nero's death and its aftermath</b></p></center>

<p>Nero's and Tigellinus' response to the conspiracy was immediate and
long-lasting. The senatorial order was decimated, as one leading member
after another was put to death or compelled to commit suicide. The year
66 saw the suicides of perhaps the most distinguished victims of the "reign
of terror," Caius Petronius [[<i>PIR<sup>2</sup></i> P294]]and Thrasea
Paetus [[<i>PIR<sup>2</sup></i> C1187]].<b><a href="#N_15_">[[15]]</a></b>
Petronius, long a favorite of Nero because of his aesthetic taste, had
been an able public servant before he turned to a life of ease and indolence.
He was recognized as the <i>arbiter elegantiae</i> of Nero's circle, and
may be the author of the <i>Satyricon</i>. At his death, he left for Nero
a document which itemized many of the latter's crimes. Thrasea, a staunch
Stoic who had been for some years an outspoken opponent of Nero's policies,
committed suicide in the Socratic manner. This scene is the last episode
in the surviving books of Tacitus' <i>Annals</i>.
</p><p>In the year 68, revolt began in the provinces, with the uprising of
<b><a href="galba.htm#Note 2">Julius
Vindex</a></b>, a Gallic noble, governor of Gallia Lugdunensis. His purpose,
it seems clear, was not a nationalistic undertaking but an attempt to depose
Nero and offer Rome the opportunity to choose a new ruler. But he received
little support from other governors; indeed, only the elderly <b><a href="galba.html">Galba
</a></b>in
Spain indicated approval. <b><a href="galba.htm#Note 2">Vindex</a></b>
may have been in communication with Lucius Verginius Rufus [[<i>PIR<sup>2
</sup></i>V284]],
governor of Germania Superior, but when he moved his army in Gaul, a battle
ensued between the two forces, perhaps instigated by the army of Germany.
Upon <b><a href="galba.htm#Note 2">Vindex's</a></b> defeat and death, Verginius
was offered the purple by his troops, which he rejected, stating that such
a decision was a prerogative of the Senate. By this action he gained enduring
fame, which was recorded on his epitaph almost thirty years later:
</p><center>
<p><i>Hic situs est Rufus, pulso qui Vindice quondam</i>
<br><i>imperium adseruit non sibi, sed patriae.</i></p></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(Pliny the Younger 9.19.1)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Here lies Rufus, who once, after Vindex's defeat,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
claimed the empire not for himself, but for his country.
</p><p>Nonetheless the end of Nero's reign became inevitable. <b><a href="galba.html">Galba</a></b>
claimed the throne and began his march from Spain. Nero panicked and was
rapidly abandoned by his supporters. He finally committed suicide with
assistance, on June 9, 68, and his body was tended and buried by three
women who had been close to him in his younger days, chief of whom was
Acte.<b><a href="#N_16_">[[16]]</a></b> His death scene is marked above
all by the statement, "<i>Qualis artifex pereo</i>," (What an artist dies
in me.) Even at the end he was more concerned with his private life than
with the affairs of state.
</p><p>The aftermath of Nero's death was cataclysmic. <b><a href="galba.html">Galba</a></b>
was the first of four emperors who revealed the new secret of empire, that
an emperor could be made elsewhere than in Rome. <b><a href="#N_17_">[[17]]
</a></b>Civil
war ensued, which was only ended by the victory of the fourth claimant,
<b><a href="vespasia.html">Vespasian</a></b>,
who established the brief dynasty of the Flavians. The dynasty of the Julio-Claudians
was at an end.
</p><p>Nero's popularity among the lower classes remained even after his death.
His close friend, and successor to <b><a href="galba.html">Galba</a></b>,
<b><a href="otho.html">Otho</a></b>
paid him all public honors. But with
<b><a href="vespasia.html">Vespasian's</a></b>
triumph Nero began to fade from public memory. <b><a href="vespasia.html">Vespasian
</a></b>built
the enormous amphitheater known from the beginning of the Middle Ages as
the Colosseum on the site of Nero's lake, the stupendous statue of himself
was transformed into a representation of a god, and in the decades of <b><a href="trajan.html">Trajan</a></b>
and <b><a href="hadrain.html">Hadrian</a></b> most of the remainder of the
Golden House disappeared under the Baths of
<b><a href="trajan.html">Trajan
</a></b>on
the Esquiline Hill and the Temple of Venus and Rome built by
<b><a href="hadrian.html">Hadrian
</a></b>at
the extreme east end of the Roman Forum. The land claimed by Nero for his
private pleasure was restored to the Roman people, for enjoyment and worship.
</p><p>Nonetheless, over the two decades or so after his death, several pseudo-Neros
appeared on the scene, claiming to be the emperor. But these claimants
had no success, and Nero then passed entirely into history.
</p><p>It is not excessive to say that he was one of the worst of Rome's emperors
in the first two centuries and more of the empire. Whatever talents he
had, whatever good he may have done, all is overwhelmed by three events,
the murder of his mother, the fire at Rome, and his savage treatment of
the Christians.
</p><p>Precisely these qualities are the reasons that he has remained so well
known and has been the subject of many writers and opera composers in modern
times. These works of fiction particularly merit mention: Henryk Sienkiewicz's
<i>Quo
Vadis</i>, one of the finest works of the 1907 Nobel Laureate in Literature,
and John Hersey's <i>The Conspiracy</i>. Nero unquestionably will always
be with us.
