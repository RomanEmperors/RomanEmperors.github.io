<h3>
Introduction</h3></center>
The reign of Tiberius (b. 42 B.C., d. A.D. 37, emperor A.D. 14-37) is a
particularly important one for the Principate, since it was the first occasion
when the powers designed for <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
alone were exercised by somebody else. <b><a href="#note#1">[[1]]</a> </b>In
contrast to the approachable and tactful <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>,
Tiberius emerges from the sources as an enigmatic and darkly complex figure,
intelligent and cunning, but given to bouts of severe depression and dark
moods that had a great impact on his political career as well as his personal
relationships. His reign abounds in contradictions. Despite his keen intelligence,
he allowed himself to come under the influence of unscrupulous men who,
as much as any actions of his own, ensured that Tiberius's posthumous reputation
would be unfavorable; despite his vast military experience, he oversaw
the conquest of no new region for the empire; and despite his administrative
abilities he showed such reluctance in running the state as to retire entirely
from Rome and live out his last years in isolation on the island of Capri.
His reign represents, as it were, the adolescence of the Principate as
an institution. Like any adolescence, it proved a difficult time.
<center>
<h3>
Early life (42-12 B.C.)</h3></center>
Tiberius Claudius Nero was born on 16 November 42 B.C. to Ti. Claudius
Nero and <b><a href="livia.html">Livia Drusilla</a></b>. Both
parents were scions of the <i>gens Claudia</i> which had supplied leaders
to the Roman Republic for many generations. Through his mother Tiberius
also enjoyed genealogical connections to prominent Republican houses such
as the Servilii Caepiones, the Aemilii Lepidi, and the Livii Drusi. From
his birth, then, Tiberius was destined for public life. But during his
boyhood the old Republican system of rule by Senate and magistrates, which
had been tottering for decades, was finally toppled and replaced by an
autocracy under the able and ambitious <b><a href="auggie.html">Octavian</a></b>
(later named <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>). It proved
fateful for Tiberius when, in 39 B.C., his mother <b><a href="livia.html">Livia</a></b>
divorced Ti. Claudius Nero and married Octavian, thereby making the infant
Tiberius the stepson of the future ruler of the Roman world. Forever afterward,
Tiberius was to have his name coupled with this man, and always to his
detriment. <b><a href="#note#2">[[2]]</a></b>
<p>Tiberius's early life was relatively uneventful, even if the times were
not. In 32 B.C, as civil war loomed between Antony and Octavian, Tiberius
made his first public appearance at the age of nine and delivered the eulogy
at his natural father's funeral. In the years following the battle of Actium
in 31 B.C., as <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b> secured
his position at the head of the state, Tiberius grew to maturity and took
his first real steps in public life. In 29 B.C. he took part in <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus's</a></b>
triumph for the Actium campaign, riding on the left of <b><a href="/auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
in the triumphal chariot. Two years later he assumed the gown of manhood
(<i>toga virilis</i>) and <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
led him into the forum. Three years after that, at the age of 17, he became
a quaestor and was given the privilege of standing for the praetorship
and consulship five years in advance of the age prescribed by law. He then
began appearing in court as an advocate and was sent by <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
to the East where, in 20 B.C., he oversaw one of his stepfather's proudest
successes. The Parthians, who had captured the eagles of the legions lost
in the failed eastern campaigns of M. Crassus (53 B.C.), Decidius Saxa
(40 B.C.), and Mark Antony (36 B.C.), formally returned them to the Romans.
Tiberius may have received a grant of proconsular power (<i>imperium proconsulare</i>)
to carry out this mission, but, if so, the sources do not mention it. After
returning from the East, Tiberius was granted praetorian rank and, in 13
B.C., he became consul. Between his praetorship and consulship he was on
active duty with his brother, Drusus Claudius Nero, combatting Alpine tribes;
he also was governor of Gallia Comata for one year, probably in 19 B.C.
His personal life was also blessed at this time by a happy marriage to
Vipsania Agrippina, the daughter of <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus's</a></b>
longstanding friend and right-hand man, <b><a href="agrippa.html">M.
Vipsanius Agrippa</a></b>. The marriage probably took place in 20 or 19
B.C. When he was consul, his wife produced a son, Drusus. <b><a href="#note#3">[[3]]</a></b>
</p><div><p>Determining the significance of all these offices, delegations, and
the marriage to Vipsania largely depends on what view is taken of <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus's</a></b>
efforts for the succession. In one sense, Tiberius's early career was an
entirely natural one for a young man so close to the center of power; it
would have been more remarkable had he stayed at home. Tiberius's career,
however, cannot be so easily divorced from the larger context of the Augustan
succession. The issue is a major one and hotly contentious. <b><a href="#note#4">[[4]]</a></b>For
the present, it is worth noting that <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>,
in his arrangements for the succession, appears to have indulged a Republican
instinct for favoring his immediate family and accordingly focused his
attentions on the Julii. First, his nephew Marcellus was favored. Following
this young man's premature death in 23 B.C., <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
used his daughter Julia to tie his friend M. Vipsanius Agrippa into his
family by marriage. The union, solemnized in 21 B.C., was a fertile one
and produced two sons within four years, both of whom <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
adopted in a single ceremony in 17 B.C. Modern scholarship has puzzled
over these labyrinthine arrangements, in which there seems no place for
the stepsons, Tiberius and Drusus. The best explanation is that <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus's</a></b>
succession scheme was a flexible one, comprising a pool of princes from
which the emperor could draw in the event of emergencies -- a wise counsel,
as matters turned out. On this view, Tiberius's early career was not insignificant,
but his position was not as elevated and evidently favored as that of Agrippa,
now the heir-apparent, and the boys, Gaius and Lucius Caesar, who seemed
marked out to succeed in the third generation. Whatever personal ambitions
Tiberius had, or his mother <b><a href="livia.html">Livia</a></b>
had for him, were to be utterly subordinated to <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus's</a></b>
wish to see a Julian at the helm of the Principate. As it was, fate was
on Tiberius's side.
</p></div><h4>
The Heir to Augustus: The First Attempt and the "Retirement" to Rhodes
(12 B.C-A.D. 2)</h4>
Agrippa died in 12 B.C. Tiberius, on <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus's</a></b>
insistence, divorced Vipsania and married Agrippa's widow, Julia. The union
was not a happy one and produced no children. Tiberius had been happily
married to Vipsania and, following an embarrassing display in public, he
was ultimately forbidden by <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
even to see her. Nevertheless, Tiberius's elevation in his stepfather's
succession scheme continued. He received important military commissions
in Pannonia and Germany between 12 and 6 B.C. and proved very successful
in the field. He was consul for the second time in 7 B.C., and, in 6 B.C.,
he was granted tribunician power (<i>tribunicia potestas</i>) and an extensive
commission in the East <b><a href="#note#5">[[5]]</a></b>. In essence,
Tiberius had replaced Agrippa as <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus's</a></b>
successor. He was Julia's husband, the leading general in the state, and
he enjoyed a share of the emperor's power. Everything seemed settled, until
the darker side of Tiberius's personality intervened.
<div><p>Without warning, in 6 B.C. Tiberius -- the visible heir to <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
-- announced his withdrawal from public life and went to live on Rhodes
with some personal friends and an astrologer, Thrasyllus. His reasons for
doing so have fueled intense speculation in ancient and modern sources.
<b><a href="#note#6">[[6]]</a></b>
Whatever his motivation, the move was not only a snub to <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>,
but it was also highly inconvenient to the latter's succession plans. Gaius
and Lucius Caesar were still too young to assume the heavy responsibilities
of the Principate, and <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
now had no immediate successor to assume power and see the boys to maturity,
since Tiberius's brother Drusus had died of an illness in 9 B.C. If anything
should befall
<b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b> now, the
Principate might be washed away or, if it should continue, his family's
position at the head of it was placed in jeopardy. Finally, and not the
least concern, there was the danger that an imperial prince removed from
<b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus's</a></b> ambit could afford
a focus for conspiracy. <b><a href="#note#7">[[7]]</a></b> Whatever had
been <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus's</a></b> opinion of Tiberius
to this point, henceforward he seems to have had little patience with,
or affection for him. Something of <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus's</a></b>
irritation is revealed by his repeated refusal to allow Tiberius to return
to Rome after the latter realized the delicacy of his position on Rhodes;
and this in spite of pressure brought to bear on <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
by his influential and persuasive wife, <b><a href="livia.html">Livia</a></b>.
When Tiberius's powers ran out in 1 B.C. they were not renewed, and his
situation became even more precarious. According to the sources, he was
expecting a ship bearing the order for his death. When the ship arrived
in A.D. 2, however, it brought quite different tidings. <b><a href="#note#8">[[8]]</a></b></p></div><center>
<h3>
The Heir to Augustus: The Second Attempt (A.D. 2-14)</h3></center>
Tragedy worked for the benefit of Tiberius. In A.D. 2 Lucius Caesar died
of an illness at Massilia. <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>,
resistant to the idea of allowing Tiberius to return, finally yielded to
the requests of <b><a href="livia.html">Livia</a></b> and Gaius
Caesar on his behalf. Tiberius returned to Rome and lived in the political
wilderness until, unexpectedly, Gaius Caesar died of a wound received during
a siege in Armenia.
<b><a href="#note#9">[[9]]</a><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>,
devastated, was left without his adoptive sons and, more importantly, without
an heir and successor. His careful planning for the succession had come
to nothing. In the crisis, he turned once more to Tiberius. The wayward
prince was summoned from private life and adopted as <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus's</a></b>
son. Also adopted by <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
was Agrippa Postumus, the third son of Julia and Agrippa. Tiberius, despite
having a natural son, was required to adopt his nephew, <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b>,
the son of his brother Drusus and married to M. Antony's daughter, <b><a href="antoniaminor.html">Antonia</a></b>.
Once more, these complicated manoeuvres surrounding the succession have
generated scholarly debate, but the best interpretation seems to be that
<b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
was re-establishing a slate of candidate princes, with Tiberius at its
head and the others as potential substitutes in the event of disaster.
Tiberius's forced adoption of <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b>
appears to have been <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus's</a></b>
attempt to mark out the succession in the third generation of the Principate.
For through <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b> lay
the only route for a Julian to the purple: <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus's</a></b>
children would have <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus's</a></b>
blood in their veins. <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus's</a></b>
continued coldness toward Tiberius is suggested in the melancholic comment
in his will about these arrangements, echoed in the <i>Res Gestae</i>:
"Since cruel fate has robbed me of my sons, Gaius and Lucius ..." <b><a href="#note#10">[[10]]</a></b>
<div><p>From A.D. 4 to 14 Tiberius was clearly <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus's</a></b>
successor. When he was adopted, he also received grants of proconsular
power and tribunician power; and in A.D. 13 his proconsular power was made
co-extensive with that of <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>.
<b><a href="#note#11">[[11]]</a></b> In effect, Tiberius was now co-princeps
with <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b> so that when the
latter finally died on 19 August A.D. 14, Tiberius's position was unassailable
and the continuation of the Principate a foregone conclusion. After 55
years living at the behest of his stepfather, Tiberius finally assumed
the mantle of sole power.
</p></div><center>
<h3>
Accession and Early Reign (A.D. 14 - 23)</h3></center>
The accession of Tiberius proved intensely awkward. After <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
had been buried and deified, and his will read and honored, the Senate
convened on 18 September to inaugurate the new reign and officially "confirm"
Tiberius as emperor. Such a transfer of power had never happened before,
and nobody, including Tiberius, appears to have known what to do. Tacitus's
account is the fullest. Tiberius came to the Senate to have various powers
and titles voted to him. Perhaps in an attempt to imitate the tact of <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>,
Tiberius donned the mask of the reluctant public servant -- and botched
the performance. Rather than tactful, he came across to the senators as
obdurate and obstructive. He declared that he was too old for the responsibilities
of the Principate, said he did not want the job, and asked if he could
just take one part of the government for himself. The Senate was confused,
not knowing how to read his behavior. Finally, one senator asked pointedly,
"Sire, for how long will you allow the State to be without a head?" Tiberius
relented and accepted the powers voted to him, although he refused the
title "Augustus." <b><a href="#note#12">[[12]]</a></b>
<p>In fact, that first meeting between the Senate and the new emperor established
a blueprint for their later interaction. Throughout his reign, Tiberius
was to baffle, befuddle, and frighten the Senators. He seems to have hoped
that they would act on his implicit desires rather than on his explicit
requests. Again, this behavior may have been an attempt to imitate <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus's</a></b>
careful and tactful use of <i>auctoritas</i>, but, if so, it backfired
and became a pathetic charade. Tiberius's opinion of the revered body as
it struggled with his oblique approach to rule was not high: "Men fit to
be slaves." <b><a href="#note#13">[[13]]</a></b>
</p><p>There was trouble not only at Rome, however. The legions posted in Pannonia
and in Germany, the most powerful concentration of troops in the empire,
took the opportunity afforded by <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus's</a></b>
death to voice their complaints about the terms and conditions of their
service. Matters escalated into an all-out mutiny that was only repressed
by the direct intervention of Tiberius's sons, <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b>
and Drusus. There was bloodshed at both locations, but in <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus's</a></b>
sector, Germany, there was particularly chaotic disorder and frightful
scenes of mayhem. <b><a href="#note#14">[[14]]</a></b>
</p><p>Despite his difficult relationship with the Senate and the Rhine mutinies,
Tiberius's first years were generally good. He stayed true to <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus's</a></b>
plans for the succession and clearly favored his adopted son <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b>
over his natural son, Drusus. (Agrippa Postumus, also adopted by Augustus
in A.D. 4, had suffered demotion and exile in A.D. 6-7, and upon <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus's</a></b>
death he was murdered; responsibility for the crime remains obscure.) On
Tiberius's request, <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b>
was granted proconsular power and assumed command in the prime military
zone of Germany, where he suppressed the mutiny there and led the formerly
restless legions on campaigns against Germanic tribes in A.D. 14-16. After
being recalled from Germany, <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b>
celebrated a triumph in Rome in A.D. 17. In the same year, he was granted
<i>imperium maius</i> over the East and, in A.D. 18, after being consul
with Tiberius as his colleague , he was sent East, just as Tiberius himself
had been almost four decades earlier. Unfortunately for Tiberius, <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b>
died there in A.D. 19 and, on his deathbed, accused the governor of Syria,
Cn. Calpurnius Piso, of murdering him. Piso was a long-time friend of Tiberius
and his appointee to the Syrian governorship, so suspicion for <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus's</a></b>
death ultimately came to rest at the palace door. When <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus's</a></b>
widow, <b><a href="aggiei.html">Agrippina (the Elder),</a></b>
returned to Italy carrying her popular husband's ashes, she publicly declared
Piso guilty of murder and hinted at the involvement of more hidden agents.
Piso was put on trial in the Senate, where he expected some help from his
friend, Tiberius. Instead, Tiberius sat statue-like and let the proceedings
take their course. In Tacitus's account, Piso realized his peril and threatened
to make public certain documents that would embarrass the emperor. The
ploy failed and Piso committed suicide; the documents were never made public.
Recently, a remarkable inscription has been found in Spain, containing
the text of the "Senatorial Decree concerning Cn. Piso, Senior." It largely
corroborates Tacitus's account, including <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus's</a></b>
death-bed accusation of Piso. But naturally, in this "official" account,
there is no mention of Tiberius's alleged involvement in <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus'</a></b>
death. <b><a href="#note#15">[[15]]</a></b>
</p><p>With <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b> dead, Tiberius
began elevating his own son Drusus to replace him as the imperial successor.
Relations with <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus's</a></b>
family were strained, but they were to reach a breaking point when Tiberius
allowed a trusted advisor to get too close and gain a tremendous influence
over him. That advisor was the Praetorian Prefect, L. Aelius Sejanus, who
would derail Tiberius's plans for the succession and drive the emperor
farther into isolation, depression, and paranoia.
</p><center>
<h3>
Sejanus (A.D. 23-31)</h3></center>
Sejanus hailed from Volsinii in Etruria. He and his father shared the Praetorian
Prefecture until A.D. 15 when the father, L. Seius Strabo, was promoted
to be Prefect of Egypt, the pinnacle of an equestrian career under the
Principate. Sejanus, now sole Prefect of the Guard, enjoyed powerful connections
to senatorial houses and had been a companion to Gaius Caesar on his mission
to the East, 1 B.C. - A.D. 4. Through a combination of energetic efficiency,
fawning sycophancy, and outward displays of loyalty, he gained the position
of Tiberius's closest friend and advisor. One development that favored
Sejanus was the concentration of all nine cohorts of Praetorian Guardsmen
into a single camp at Rome. <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
had billeted these troops discretely in small towns around Rome, but now
Tiberius -- undoubtedly with Sejanus's encouragement, perhaps even at his
suggestion -- brought them into the city, probably in A.D. 17 or 18. Sejanus,
therefore, commanded some 9,000 troops within the city limits. As Sejanus's
public profile became more and more pronounced, his statues were erected
in public places, and Tiberius openly praised him as "the partner of my
labors." But Sejanus had his own ideas. <b><a href="#note#16">[[16]]</a></b>
<p>According to Tacitus, Sejanus's first subversive act was the seduction
of Tiberius's daughter-in-law, Livilla, at the time married to Drusus,
Tiberius's son. Drusus, it seems, resented Sejanus's influence over his
father so the Prefect, in conjunction with Livilla, poisoned him in A.D.
23. <b><a href="#note#17">[[17]]</a></b> There followed a series of attacks
on <b><a href="aggiei.html">Agrippina</a></b>'s friends, mostly
played out in the courts in the guise of charges of treason (<i>maiestas</i>)
but, in Tacitus's account, actually the work of Sejanus. <b><a href="#note#18">[[18]]</a></b>
</p><p>Then, in A.D. 25, Sejanus asked Tiberius for permission to marry Livilla,
Drusus's widow. Tiberius refused. This setback for Sejanus was offset the
following year, when the ageing emperor withdrew from Rome to live on Capri;
he was never to return to the city. Tiberius was most probably encouraged
in his decision to retire by Sejanus, who now became the chief vehicle
of access to the emperor. With Tiberius absent, Sejanus vented his full
fury against <b><a href="aggiei.html">Agrippina</a></b>'s family,
whose demise he had been plotting for some time. In rapid succession <b><a href="aggiei.html">Agrippina</a></b>
and her eldest son, Nero Caesar, and eventually also Drusus Caesar, who
had been involved in his brother's downfall, were arrested, convicted,
and imprisoned. By A.D. 31 Sejanus had reached the pinnacle of his power
and was effectively emperor himself. The sources paint a grimly comic picture
of senators lining up to pay respects to a man they considered their social
inferior. <b><a href="#note#19">[[19]]</a></b>
</p><p>What exactly Sejanus was aiming at remains a matter of intense debate.
<b><a href="#note#20">[[20]]</a></b>The
Prefect's attacks against <b><a href="aggiei.html">Agrippina</a></b>
and his proposal to marry Drusus's widow, Livilla, suggest that he was
attempting to follow the precedent of Agrippa, that is, an outsider who
became the emperor's successor through a combination of overt loyalty,
necessity, and a family alliance forged by marriage. Tiberius, perhaps
sensitive to this ambition, rejected Sejanus's initial proposal to marry
Livilla in A.D. 25, but later put it about that he had withdrawn his objections
so that, in A.D. 30., Sejanus was betrothed to Livilla's daughter (Tiberius'
granddaughter). The Prefect's family connection to the Imperial house was
now imminent. In A.D. 31 Sejanus held the consulship with the emperor as
his colleague, an honor Tiberius reserved only for heirs to the throne.
Further, when Sejanus surrendered the consulship early in the year, he
was granted a share of the emperor's proconsular power. When he was summoned
to a meeting of the Senate on 18 October in that year he probably expected
to receive a share of the tribunician power; with that he would, after
all, have become Tiberius's Agrippa. <b><a href="#note#21">[[21]]</a></b>
</p><p>But in a shocking and unexpected turn of events, the letter sent by
Tiberius from Capri initially praised Sejanus extensively, and then suddenly
denounced him as a traitor and demanded his arrest. Chaos ensued. Senators
long allied with Sejanus headed for the exits, the others were confused
-- was this a test of their loyalty? what did the emperor want them to
do? -- but the Praetorian Guard, the very troops formerly under Sejanus's
command but recently and secretly transferred to the command of Q. Sutorius
Macro, arrested Sejanus, conveyed him to prison, and shortly afterwards
executed him summarily. A witch-hunt followed. Sejanus's family was arrested
and executed; Livilla perished; followers and friends of Sejanus were denounced
and imprisoned, or tried and executed; some committed suicide. All around
the city, grim scenes were played out, and as late as A.D. 33 a general
massacre of all those still in custody took place. <b><a href="#note#22">[[22]]</a></b>
</p><div><p>Tiberius himself later claimed that he turned on Sejanus because he
had been alerted to Sejanus's plot against <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus's</a></b>
family. This explanation has been rejected by most ancient and modern authorities,
since Sejanus's demise did nothing to alleviate that family's troubles:
<b><a href="aggiei.html">Agrippina</a></b>
remained under house arrest, Drusus was still housed in the Palatine's
basement, and both died violently within three years of the Prefect's fall.
Tiberius is also said to have discovered Sejanus's part in his own son's
death in A.D. 23; the source of this information, however, is suspect (see
n. <b><a href="#note#23">[[23]]</a>)</b>. Possibly, in the highly charged
atmosphere surrounding Sejanus's fall, the news acted as a catalyst, but
its truth cannot be verified. Whatever the precise reasons, Sejanus's career
and demise, and that of those around him, was an object lesson in the dangers
of imperial politics. To achieve power under the emperors, the ambitious
needed to get close to the source, but getting too close could lead to
catastrophe, for both the aspirant and any who rode his coattails. <b><a href="#note#23">[[23]]</a></b></p></div><center>
<h3>
The Last Years (A.D. 31-37)</h3></center>
The Sejanus affair appears to have greatly depressed Tiberius. A close
friend and confidant had betrayed him; whom could he trust anymore? His
withdrawal from public life seemed more complete in the last years. Letters
kept him in touch with Rome, but it was the machinery of the Augustan administration
that kept the empire running smoothly. Tiberius, if we believe our sources,
spent much of his time indulging his perversities on Capri. He also became
all but paranoid in his dealings with others and spent long hours brooding
over the death of his son, Drusus, which had now been revealed to him as
the work of his "friend" Sejanus; all who were implicated, he had executed
in barbaric fashion. As a result, no measures were taken for the succession,
beyond vague indications of favor to his nephew <b><a href="gaius.html">Gaius</a></b>
(Caligula) and his grandson <b><a href="gemell.html">Tiberius
Gemellus</a>.<a href="#note#24">[[24]]</a></b>
<div><p>Tiberius died quietly in a villa at Misenum on 16 March A.D. 37. He
was 78 years old. There are some hints in the sources of the hand of Caligula
in the deed, but such innuendo can be expected at the death of an emperor,
especially when his successor proved so depraved. The level of unpopularity
Tiberius had achieved by the time of his death with both the upper and
lower classes is revealed by these facts: the Senate refused to vote him
divine honors, and mobs filled the streets yelling "To the Tiber with Tiberius!"
(in reference to a method of disposal reserved for the corpses of criminals).
<b><a href="#note#25">[[25]]</a></b></p></div><center>
<h3>
Tiberius and the Empire</h3></center>
Three main aspects of Tiberius's impact on the empire deserve special attention:
his relative military inertia; his modesty in dealing with offers of divine
honors and his fair treatment of provincials; and his use of the Law of
Treason (<i>maiestas</i>).
<p>At the meeting of the Senate in September A.D. 14 when <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus's</a></b>
will was read, another document was produced. It was a sort of posthumous
"State of the Empire" address that listed all the resources, army postings,
etc. of the state. Part of the document urged future rulers to leave things
as they were, and not to expand the empire further. This so-called "Testament
of Augustus" appears to be the basic reason why Tiberius did not expand
the empire, though the authenticity of the "Testament" itself has divided
scholars. Nevertheless, throughout his reign, Tiberius embarked on no major
wars of conquest, although he did order punitive campaigns against the
Germans across the Rhine in A.D. 14-16; the suppression of a Gallic national
revolt under Julius Sacrovir in A.D. 21-22; and the suppression of a persistent
guerilla war in North Africa under Tacfarinas in A.D. 17-24. Tiberius seemed
adept at choosing provincial governors, with some notable exceptions, and
his diplomatic management of potentially disruptive instabilities in Armenia
was exemplary -- no Roman intervention in force was required. <b><a href="#note#26">[[26]]</a></b>
</p><p>In general, Tiberius dealt fairly and well with the provincials. The
emperor's absence from Rome hardly affected the majority of the empire's
population, for whom the emperor was already a shadowy and distant figure.
His generally sound choices of provincial governors have already been noted.
When the provincials overstepped themselves and offered Tiberius divine
honors, or other tributes that struck him as excessive, he declined to
accept. Tacitus and Suetonius infer hypocrisy, but there is no reason to
suspect that the lugubrious emperor was not acting in good faith in abiding
by <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus's</a></b> precedent, which
was always a paramount concern for him. <b><a href="#note#27">[[27]]</a></b>
</p><div><p>One area of administration where Tiberius did diverge from Augustan
practice was his increasingly frequent invocation of the treason law (<i>maiestas</i>)
to attack his enemies. Since his working relationship with the Senators
was not a good one, repression was a convenient method in dealing with
them. This legislation was one of Sejanus's chief tools, but Tiberius himself
used it liberally. Dozens of Senators and <i>equites</i> are on record
as having fallen to it. It was a precedent followed in later years by emperors
more tyrannical still than Tiberius had ever been. <b><a href="#note#28">[[28]]</a></b></p></div><center>
<h3>
Conclusion</h3></center>
It is all but inevitable that any historical assessment of Tiberius will
quickly devolve into a historiographical assessment of Tacitus. So masterful
is Tacitus's portrayal of his subject, and so influential has it been ever
since, that in all modern treatments of Tiberius, in attempting to get
at the man, must address the issue of Tacitus's historiographical methods,
his sources, and his rhetoric. The subject is too vast to address here,
but some points are salient. Tacitus's methods, especially his use of innuendo
and inference to convey notions that are essentially editorial glosses,
makes taking his portrayal of Tiberius at face value inadvisable. Further,
his belief in the immutable character of people -- that one's character
is innate at birth and cannot be changed, although it can be disguised
-- prevents him from investigating the possibility that Tiberius evolved
and developed over his lifetime and during his reign. Instead, Tacitus's
portrayal is one of peeling back layers of dissimulation to reach the "real"
Tiberius lurking underneath. <b><a href="#note#29">[[29]]</a></b>
<div><p>Overall, Tiberius's reign can be said to show the boons and banes of
rule by one man, especially a man as dark, awkward, and isolated as Tiberius.
For the people of the provinces, it was a peaceful and well-ordered time.
Governors behaved themselves, and there were no destructive or expensive
wars. In the domestic sphere, however, the concentration of power in one
person made all the greater the threat of misbehavior by ambitious satellites
like Sejanus or foolish friends like Piso. Furthermore, if the emperor
wished to remain aloof from the mechanics of power, he could do so. Administrators,
who depended on him for their directions, could operate without his immediate
supervision, but their dealings with a man like Sejanus could lead to disaster
if that man fell from grace. As a result, although he was not a tyrant
himself, Tiberius's reign sporadically descended into tyranny of the worst
sort. In the right climate of paranoia and suspicion, widespread denunciation
led to the deaths of dozens of Senators and equestrians, as well as numerous
members of the imperial house. In this sense, the reign of Tiberius decisively
ended the Augustan illusion of "the Republic Restored" and shone some light
into the future of the Principate, revealing that which was both promising
and terrifying.

</p><p><a name="note#6"></a>[[6]] The following reasons are posited in the
literary sources, which often present several rumored possibilities in
conjunction: he wanted a rest from work (Suet. <i>Tib</i>. 10.2; Vell.
2.99.1-2); he hated his wife Julia and wanted to be away from her (Dio.
55.9.7; Suet. <i>Tib</i>. 10.1, 11.4; Tac. <i>Ann</i>. 1.43); he wished
to avoid a possible confrontation with Gaius and Lucius Caesar, with whom
he did not get along (Dio 55.9.1-6; Suet. <i>Tib</i>. 10.1, 11.5); he wished
to enhance his prestige by being absent from Rome (Suet. <i>Tib</i>. 10.1).
According to Suetonius, Tiberius himself initially claimed that he was
weary and wanted a rest, but later changed his story and said he did not
want a confrontation with Gaius and Lucius (Suet. <i>Tib</i>. 10.2, 11.5).
For a more Machiavellian interpretation of the reasons behind the retirement,
see Levick, "Tiberius's Retirement to Rhodes" and <i>Tib. the Pol</i>.,
31-46; Levick postulates the rise of a "Julian" party within the imperial
house that drove Tiberius underground. For a further analysis of this party's
activities, see her "Julians and Claudians." The reconstruction is a clever
one, although largely without ancient attestation. For a similarly "political"
interpretation of the relationship between Tiberius and Julia, see also,
Sattler, "Tiberius und Julia." A recent theory, that Tiberius was on an
undercover mission to the East at Augustus's behest, is imaginative but
unconvincing; see P. Southern,
<i>Augustus</i> (London, 1998), 173-76
</p><p><a name="note#7"></a>[[7]] Death of Drusus: Dio 55.1-2. The existence
of some worry concerning a possible conspiracy is borne out by the rumors
of Tiberius's dealings with military commanders while on Rhodes, thereby
exciting his stepfather's suspicions, see Suet. <i>Tib</i>. 12.3; Bowersock,
"Augustus and the East." Another prince held on an island, Agrippa Postumus,
later proved the point: a slave claiming to be the prince garnered some
support until he was captured and executed, see Tac. <i>Ann</i>. 2.39-40;
Suet. <i>Tib</i>. 25.
</p><p><a name="note#8"></a>[[8]] Tiberius stuck on Rhodes: Suet. <i>Tib</i>.
11.4 - 13.2. The precariousness of Tiberius's position is reflected in
the open destruction of his statues at Nemausus (Suet. <i>Tib</i>. 13.1).
If this anecdote is true, it reflects the low level of Tiberius's public
image at this time.

Tac. <i>Ann</i>. 1.3; Vell. 2.103.2-3; see also Birch, "The Settlement
of 26 June, A.D. 4." Augustus's cold attitude to Tiberius is perhaps also
echoed in the rather distant way he refers to him in the <i>RG</i>, "Tiberius
Nero, who was at that time my stepson" (<i>RG</i> 27.2, 30.1: ... <i>per
Ti. Neronem, qui tum mihi privignus erat</i> ... ). Tiberius, in fact,
is never referred to as Augustus's son in the <i>RG</i>, despite its composition
some nine years after Tiberius's adoption. In contrast, Gaius and Lucius
Caesar are always termed "my sons" by Augustus (<i>RG</i> 14, 20.3, 22,
27.2). In addition, Augustus added the phrase "This I do for reasons of
State" to the official formula when adopting Tiberius. The statement is
ambiguous, however, and can be read either as a clear statement of Tiberius's
qualities and suitability for the Principate or as an indication of Augustus's
lack of affection for him (Suet. <i>Tib</i>. 23). It is noteworthy that
Suetonius (<i>Tib</i>. 21) provides ample testimony from Augustus's own
correspondence of the latter's affection for Tiberius.

or how I should write it, or, indeed, what I should not write at this time,
may the gods ruin me more horribly than I feel myself dying everyday."
The quote is also indicative of Tiberius's dark mental state.

Senatorial decree on Piso: W. Eck et al., <i>Senatus Consultum de Cn. Pisone
Patr</i>e. (The death of Germanicus and Tiberius's real or imagined place
in it has generated intense debate in modern scholarship, see the <i>DIR</i>'s
Germanicus.)
</p><p><a name="note#16"></a>[[16]] On Sejanus's background, see Bird "Sejanus
and His Political Influence"; Levick, <i>Tib. the Pol</i>., 158-60; Sumner,
"Family Connections." Sejanus as sole Prefect/moving the guards into Rome:
Tac. <i>Ann</i>. 4.2; Dio 57.19.6, see also Durry, <i>Cohortes prétoriennes</i>,
43-63. Partner of my labors: Tac. <i>Ann</i>. 4.2. A good example of Sejanus's
overt loyalty to Tiberius is the incident in Spelunca (Sperlonga) in A.D.
26. When a rockfall buried the imperial party as it dined in a natural
cave, Sejanus covered Tiberius's body with his own and remained in that
position until the rescuers reached them, see Tac. <i>Ann</i>. 4.59 (Suet.
<i>Tib</i>.
39 makes no mention of Sejanus's role in the incident). Was this a genuine
act of loyalty, or an ostentatious display designed to impress the Emperor?
</p><p><a name="note#17"></a>[[17]] Tac. <i>Ann</i>. 4.3-8; Suet. <i>Tib</i>.
39; Dio 57.22.1. It remains suspicious that no inkling of foul play in
Drusus's death was entertained until eight years later, when Sejanus's
ex-wife, Apicata, "revealed" the matter in her suicide note, see below
note <a href="#note#23">[23]</a>. Quite possibly, Drusus died of natural
causes and Sejanus's involvement is a myth.
</p><p><a name="note#18"></a>[[18]] Sejanus's attacks on Agrippina's family
friends: see C. Silius and Sosia Galla in A.D. 24 (Tac. <i>Ann</i>. 4.18-20
), Claudia Pulchra in A.D. 26 (Tac. <i>Ann</i>. 4.52), and T. Sabinus in
A.D. 28 (Tac. <i>Ann</i>. 4.68-70; Dio 58.1.1b-3). There is some doubt,
however, as to how many of the cases Tacitus ascribes to him were actually
the work of Sejanus, see Levick, <i>Tib. the Pol</i>., 163-64. The cases
just listed, however, seem securely Sejanian.
</p><p><a name="note#19"></a>[[19]] Marriage proposal: Tac. <i>Ann</i>. 4.39-40,
see also Seager, <i>Tiberius</i>, 195-96; Levick, <i>Tib. the Pol</i>.

</p><p><a name="note#20"></a>[[20]] The ancient sources are vague on Sejanus's
goals: Tacitus (<i>Ann</i>. 4.1, 3) merely states that he wanted <i>regnum</i>;
Dio (57.22.4b) says he aimed at power; Suetonius (<i>Tib</i>. 65.1) claims
the prefect was a revolutionary; and Josephus (<i>AJ</i> 18.181) comments
that Sejanus led a conspiracy, but omits mention of its purpose. Modern
opinion is divided. Marsh (<i>Reign</i>, 166) and Seager (<i>Tiberius</i>,
180-81) see Sejanus as aiming at regency over Caligula and Gemellus; Smith
(<i>Tiberius and Empire</i>, 152-53) sees Sejanus as a naive innocent who
rose too high for his own boots; Rogers ("Conspiracy') argues that Agrippina
was plotting against Tiberius and Sejanus was merely defending him. The
notion that Sejanus was attempting to topple Tiberius (Suet. <i>Tib</i>.
48.2, 65.1) has been rightly questioned by modern scholars (e.g., Marsh,
<i>Reign</i>,
204-10). Sejanus was an underling whose career was tied to Tiberius. He
never reached a point where he was equal, never mind superior to the emperor,
and so he could not have replaced him successfully. The best explanation
for Sejanus's goals is that put forward by Levick (<i>Tib. the Pol</i>.,
170-71), since taken up by Shotter (<i>Tiberius Caesar</i>, 42-44), that
Sejanus aimed at being to Tiberius what Agrippa had been to Augustus: the
trusted servant who would succeed to the throne. This explains Sejanus's
attacks on Tiberius's successors (Drurus and the family of Germanicus)
and is echoed in two comments in the sources: in Tacitus (<i>Ann</i>. 4.3)
when he comments that a house full of Caesars was an obstacle to Sejanus's
plans, and in Dio (57.22.4b) when he expressly says that Sejanus wanted
to succeed Tiberius.

and Jones, <i>Documents</i>, p. 32 and nos. 50a, 358a.
<i>Imperium pronconsulare</i>:
Dio 58.7.4. The comments about Sejanus in Velleius Paterculus, whose work
was published in A.D. 30 or early in 31, show the extent of Sejanus's power:
Velleius praises Sejanus at length, calling him the "helper" of Tiberius
(Vell. 2.127-28; see also Tac. <i>Ann</i>. 4.7). Dio (58.4.3-4) reports
also that Sejanus was consul designate for A.D. 31 and that sacrifices
were offered to his image along with Tiberius's.
</p><p><a name="note#22"></a>[[22]] Fall of Sejanus: Dio (58.5.5 - 11.5) provides
the only narrative account, but see also Suet. <i>Tib</i>. 65. Witch-hunt:

notable exception is Piso in Syria when Germanicus was there.

4.55-56. For a summary of Tiberius's dealings with excessive honors and
the provincials, see the relevant chapters in Levick, <i>Tib. the Pol</i>.,
Marsh, <i>Reign</i>, and Seager, <i>Tiberius</i>. Note also, Shotter, <i>Tiberius
Caesar</i>, 51-58.
</p><p><a name="note#28"></a>[[28]] Among the most shocking invocations of
the law was the case in A.D. 24 of the Vibii Sereni, father and son, who
found themselves in the roles of defendant and prosecutor respectively
(Tac. <i>Ann</i>. 4,28-30). Tacitus (<i>Ann</i>. 4.32-33), in fact, apologizes
for the monotony of his narrative in documenting these "show trials" in
such detail. See Levick, <i>Tib. the Pol</i>., 180-200; Marsh, <i>Reign</i>,
289-95; Chilton, "Roman Law of Treason"; Rogers, <i>Criminal Trials</i>.
</p><div><p><a name="note#29"></a>[[29]] This is particularly evident in Tacitus's
scathing "obituary" of Tiberius at <i>Ann</i>. 6.51.
