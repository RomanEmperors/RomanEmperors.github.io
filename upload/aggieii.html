<b>Agrippina the Younger (Wife of Claudius)</b></h3></center>

<center>
<h4>
Donna Hurley</h4></center>

<p>Julia Agrippina (Agrippina the Younger) played a notable role in the
Julio-Claudian family drama. Her influence had as its origin the only resource
available to women of her time, proximity to male power.&nbsp; She, like
<b><a href="livia.html">Livia
</a></b>before
her, was the wife of one emperor and the mother of another.&nbsp; She was
also the sister of a third and the daughter of a prince of the imperial
house whose shadow fell across dynastic politics long after his death.&nbsp;
She could not in any case have avoided the complications that were her
lot by birth, but she evidently had the desire -- and the will -- to exploit
the position into which she had been born.&nbsp; She wrote a memoir that
recorded the "misfortunes of her family" (<i>casus suorum</i>). This document
alone seems proof that she was deeply aware of the stress generated from
a dangerous environment.
<b><span class="text-2xl"><a href="#N_1">[[1]]</a></span></b>
</p><center>
<p><b>Early Life</b></p></center>

<p>Agrippina the Younger was the daughter of <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus
Julius Caesar </a></b>and of Vipsania Agrippina (Agrippina the Elder).
<b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus'</a></b>
father was a son of <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus'
</a></b>wife <b><a href="livia.html">Livia</a></b>
by a former husband. His mother was Antonia Minor, daughter of Mark Antony
and Octavia, <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus'</a></b> sister. <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b>
had thus a double connection with the first family of Rome, and he drew
closer to its center in AD 4 when his uncle, who would become the emperor
<b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>,
was adopted by <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>, and adopted him
in turn. In this way <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b> became
a Julian and by the law of adoption a legitimate grandson of the ruling
dynast. Agrippina's mother, Agrippina the Elder, was a daughter of<b><a href="julia.html">
Julia,</a></b> <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>' natural daughter
and only child, and of <b><a href="marcusagrippa.html">Marcus Agrippa</a></b>,
<b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus'</a></b>
valued helper in his climb to the top.
</p><p>Agrippina the Younger's ancestry on both sides of her family thus converged
on <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>. But as one of nine children,
six of whom lived to maturity, she was not the only one so marked. Hers
was a large family that promised continuity for the imperial house, and
all its surviving members were involved in the power struggles of the first
century. <b><a href="#N_2">[[2]]</a></b> Agrippina was born on November
6, probably in AD 14, on the Rhine frontier. <b><a href="#N_3">[[3]]</a></b>
Her mother had found herself in this quarter because she had accompanied
<b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b>
when he exercised his command over the Armies of Upper and Lower Germany.&nbsp;
By 17, the family had returned to Rome and little Agrippina, her three
surviving brothers, and a baby sister rode in their father's triumph. <b><a href="#N_4">[[4]]
</a></b>Later
in 17 her parents left Rome for Syria, where <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b>
would assume supreme command (<i>maius imperium</i>) of the eastern provinces.
Agrippina and most of her siblings were left behind in the care of nurses
and the extended family. Only her brother <b><a href="gaius.html">Gaius,</a></b>
whom history would know as Caligula, went east with his parents. Agrippina
would not see her father again; <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b>
died near Antioch. She and the rest of the family went to meet her mother
when she was bearing his ashes home to Rome in AD 20. <b><a href="#N_5">[[5]]</a></b>
</p><p>Agrippina next appears in the historical record in AD 28 when she was
married to Cn.&nbsp; Domitius Ahenobarbus <b><a href="#N_6">[[6]]</a></b>.&nbsp;
Their union had been arranged by <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>,
now emperor and head of the imperial household. Arranged marriages were
standard practice for all families of prominence and a matter of state
business for the ruling house.&nbsp; Ahenobarbus came from a distinguished
family that boasted a long line of consuls. Made consul himself in AD 32,
he remained in office that entire year. <b><a href="#N_7">[[7]]</a></b>
He was, in addition, related to the Augustan line through his mother, Antonia
Maior. Their first son and only child, <b><a href="nero.html">L. Domitius
Ahenobarbus,</a></b> was not born until December of 37. He would become
the emperor<b><a href="nero.html"> Nero,</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b>The Reign of Gaius</b></p></center>

<p>An anecdote about this child furnishes an example of the motif central
to Agrippina's reputation. Her brother <b><a href="gaius.html">Gaius</a></b>
had succeeded <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b> to the principate
earlier that year, and it is reported that she asked him to name the infant,
hoping perhaps that the still childless emperor would name him after himself
and perhaps adopt him in time. If he were <b><a href="gaius.html">Gaius'</a></b>
heir, hers would be the prize of motherhood. Instead, <b><a href="gaius.html">Gaius</a></b>
looked at his uncle, who, although he would be the emperor <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>
soon enough, was at that time a laughing-stock in the court, and he suggested
his name as a joke. <b><a href="#N_8">[[8]]</a></b> This anecdote may have
come into existence only after <b><a href="nero.html">Nero </a></b>became
emperor and Agrippina was indeed the emperor's mother (<i>mater principis</i>)<i>.&nbsp;</i>
It nonetheless illustrates clearly the popular perception that her ambition
was of long duration.
</p><p>During the first years of his reign, <b><a href="gaius.html">Gaius </a></b>showed
great honor to Agrippina and to her sisters, Drusilla and Livilla. The
young emperor was bereft of family support and so elevated and honored
all he could muster, his three sisters and his uncle <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>.
The sisters were to be included in oaths, sit with him at games, and take
turns occupying the traditional wife's position at table. <b><a href="#N_9">[[9]]</a></b>
This conspicuous preference prompted rumors of incest, a closer relationship
yet. <b><a href="#N_10">[[10]]</a></b> But the favorable treatment soon
ended. In AD 38, Drusilla died. She was the sister with whom <b><a href="gaius.html">Gaius</a></b>
had the closest relationship, and he had chosen her husband, M. Aemilius
Lepidus, as his interim successor. <b><a href="#N_11">[[11]]</a></b> Her
death put an end to this arrangement and was a prelude to a conspiracy
in which Lepidus played a prominent part. Details are unclear, but it seems
that the two surviving sisters had given up on the erratic <b><a href="gaius.html">Gaius</a></b>
and offered Lepidus the asset of their Julian blood in order to help validate
his attempt to take over the principate.&nbsp; Livilla and especially Agrippina
were accused of having sexual relations with him. Reality or metaphor,
the allegation gave substance to the notion that they were his partners.
Lepidus was executed and Agrippina was forced to carry his ashes back to
Rome. She and Livilla were sent into exile on the Pontian Islands off the
coast of southern Italy.<b><a href="#N_12"> [[12]]</a></b>
</p><p>Domitius Ahenobarbus died in the winter of AD 40-41 while Agrippina
was probably still in exile<b><a href="#N_13">[[13]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b><a href="gaius.html">Gaius</a> </b>was assassinated in January of 41,
and after his death the sisters returned to Rome.<b><a href="#N_14"> [[14]]</a></b>
Although her property that had been confiscated by <b><a href="gaius.html">Gaius</a></b>
was restored to her on her return, much of it may have been dissipated,
and she looked quickly for protection and wealth. She set her sights on
the prominent
<b><a href="galba.html">Ser. Sulpicius Galba</a></b>, who
would become emperor after the Julio-Claudian line came to an end, but
this first effort was unsuccessful. <b><a href="#N_15">[[15]]</a></b> She
soon married the wealthy and witty C. Sallustius Crispus Passienus, consul
in 27 and again in 44, He had formerly been the husband of a sister of
Domitius Ahenobarbus and so was her brother-in-law. Passienus died before
47 and it was rumored that Agrippina had poisoned him. <b><a href="#N_16">[[16]]</a></b>
His wealth provided a motive, but his death also left her free to make
her next move, a move that would finally bring her close to the principate.
</p><center>
<p><b>The Reign of Claudius</b></p></center>

<p><b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius (Tiberius Claudius Nero)</a></b>
became emperor in AD 41 after the death of <b><a href="gaius.html">Gaius</a></b>.
He was the brother of Agrippina's father <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b>
and so her uncle.&nbsp; During the first part of his reign, <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius'
</a></b>wife
was <b><a href="valmess.html">Valeria Messalina,</a></b> who, like Domitius
Ahenobarbus, was descended from Antonia Maior. The two had a daughter,
Octavia, and then a son, Britannicus, who was born a few weeks after <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>
became emperor. In the autumn of 48 <b><a href="valmess.html">Messalina</a></b>
divorced <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b> unilaterally and married
C. Silius, consul-designate for the following year. By this action she
transferred her Julian credentials to a party who she thought would be
able to protect her interests after <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>&nbsp;
died, an event that might be expected before very long. <b><a href="#N_17">[[17]]</a></b>
The move is reminiscent of the one that Agrippina and Livilla had made
a decade earlier when they transferred their support from <b><a href="gaius.html">Gaius</a></b>
to Lepidus in the hope of grabbing on to a rising star.&nbsp; But it may
also have included a preemptive strike against Agrippina, who was plausibly
maneuvering to replace <b><a href="valmess.html">Messalina</a></b> as imperial
wife and make her own son the preferred heir.<b><a href="#N_18">[[18]]</a>&nbsp;

<a href="valmess.html">Messalina</a> </b>did not succeed; <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>
learned of the attempted coup, and she lost her life.
</p><p><b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b> looked for a new wife at
once, and Agrippina was the candidate on the spot, ready and willing. It
was reported that she seduced him by behaving in a manner more intimate
than was appropriate for a niece. <b><a href="#N_20">[[20]]</a></b> In
fact, their marriage, like all dynastic marriages, was a political arrangement
and it benefited both. Agrippina attained the long-coveted position of
imperial wife, and <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b> was able
to keep the daughter of his still popular brother <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b>
from marrying someone else and so legitimating a potential rival with her
family connection. Her bid to become <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius'
</a></b>wife
was championed by the powerful imperial freedman Pallas. These two continued
to work closely together, so closely that in time it was thought that their
relationship was sexual.<b><a href="#N_19"> [[19]] </a></b>But an impediment
stood in the way of <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b> and Agrippina:
Marriage between uncle and niece was incestuous and illegal.&nbsp; At the
initiative of Pallas and the palace insider L. Vitellius, the senate voted
to make such a union legal, at least when the uncle was on the father's
side. Agrippina and <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b> lost no
time and were married early in AD 49, only months after <b><a href="valmess.html">Messalina</a></b>
had been removed from the scene. <b><a href="#N_21">[[21]]</a></b>
</p><p><b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b> was eleven years old and still named
L. Domitius Ahenobarbus at this point. He was quickly betrothed to Octavia,
the daughter of <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b> and <b><a href="valmess.html">Messalina</a></b>,
and it was assumed that Agrippina had set in motion this plan that would
bind the families more closely. <b><a href="#N_22">[[22]]</a></b> The next
year (AD 50) <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b> adopted the boy,
and he became <b><a href="nero.html">Nero Claudius Caesar</a></b>. <b><a href="#N_23">[[23]]</a></b>.
<b><a href="britty.html">Britannicus</a></b>,
<b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius'</a></b>
natural son, now stood in second place; <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b>
had become the older son. Agrippina was thought to have manipulated her
husband so that he adopted<b><a href="nero.html"> Nero</a></b> just as she
had arranged his marriage with Octavia, since it moved her son to the head
of the line for succession.&nbsp; But the adoption was helpful to <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>
as well. A son who would reach his majority a few years before <b><a href="britty.html">Britannicus</a></b>
provided more proximate protection.
</p><p>As <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius'</a></b> wife, Agrippina was granted
public honors.&nbsp; In AD 50 she received the title Augusta, the first
living woman so honored since <b><a href="livia.html">Livia</a></b>, and
her name was attached to a colony for discharged veterans at <i>oppidum
Ubiorum</i> (Cologne)<i>.</i> <b><a href="#N_24">[[24]]</a></b> The next
year she was allowed the use of the <i>carpentum, </i>the ceremonial carriage
usually reserved for priests and sacred statues<i>. </i>She received the
defeated British chieftain Caratacus jointly with <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>,
occupying a platform that stood near that of her husband. On at least one
ceremonial occasion she presided in a golden cloak. "She put it forth that
she was herself a partner in the empire acquired by her ancestors. " <b><a href="#N_25">[[25]]</a></b>
</p><p>In AD 54 <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b>, although young (he was
sixteen), was technically an adult and so legally able to become princeps
should his adoptive father die. But <b><a href="britty.html">Britannicus</a></b>,
trailing three years behind, would soon cross that threshold of manhood
and become eligible as well, at least in theory.&nbsp; It was convenient
that <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b> die promptly so that <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b>
could be in place before <b><a href="britty.html">Britannicus</a></b> came
of age.&nbsp; <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius </a></b>did die, rather
suddenly, on October 13. His death may well have been from natural causes,
but Agrippina was inevitably accused of poisoning him. The timetable provided
a motive:&nbsp; <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b> was allegedly
beginning to regret his marriage to her and in the process of changing
his mind about the preferred position of <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b>.
<b><a href="#N_26">[[26]]</a></b>
Agrippina was accused of manipulating events further when she kept <b><a href="britty.html">Britannicus</a></b>
out of sight until after the praetorian guard had made its initial salute
to <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b> as its commander. <b><a href="#N_27">[[27]]</a></b>
His first watchword to the guard, "best of mothers" (<i>optima mater</i>),
can be understood as acknowledgement that he owed her the principate. <b><a href="#N_28">[[28]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b>The Reign of Nero</b></p></center>

<p>Agrippina now held a second role of potential influence. No longer wife
of the <i>princeps,</i> she became the mother of one, the progression that
<b><a href="livia.html">Livia</a></b>
had followed.&nbsp; Immediately after
<b><a href="nero.html">Nero'</a></b>s
accession, Agrippina received further honors.&nbsp; She was named a priestess
of the cult of the newly deified
<b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>
and was granted the attendance of two lictors when she appeared in public.
She became the first living woman whose portrait bust appeared on the imperial
coinage along with that of a reigning emperor. She listened in on meetings
of the senate from behind a curtain; this image makes overt the idea of
involvement in state affairs behind the scenes.<b><a href="#N_29">[[29]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
These external trappings may not, however, have corresponded to genuine
power. <b><a href="#N_30">[[30]]</a></b>
</p><p>The period of formal recognition did not last long in any case. By the
next year (AD 55) <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b> appears firmly dependent
on the direction of his praetorian praefect Burrus (Sex. Afranius Burrus)
and his tutor Seneca (L. Annaeus Seneca). But already in AD 54,&nbsp; her
influence seems to have been diminished.&nbsp; She approached the dais
where<b><a href="nero.html"> Nero</a></b> was about to receive an envoy
from Armenia, intending to join him on the same platform, not on a separate
one as she had on a comparable state occasion with <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>.
Prompted by Burrus and Seneca, <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b> stepped
down to meet her and in this way turned aside her bid for symbolic joint
leadership.&nbsp; <b><a href="#N_31">[[31]]</a></b>
</p><p>Open conflict between mother and son arose over his affair with a freedwoman
named Acte. <b><a href="#N_32">[[32]]</a></b> An irregular liaison of this
sort with a social inferior would not normally have provoked attention,
but in the current context Acte could be construed as a challenge to <b><a href="nero.html">Nero's</a></b>
wife Octavia, who, as <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius'</a></b> daughter,
was a bond between the previous regime and that of her husband. But <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b>
was moving away from the past, both from his mother and from <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>,
and as a result Agrippina was forced to depend on her former husband for
an increasing portion of her prestige.<b><a href="#N_33"> [[33]] </a></b>Agrippina
was said to have become desperate enough at this point in time (AD 55)
to acknowledge her complicity in the death of <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>.
The admission was intended to make clear to <b><a href="nero.html">Nero
</a></b>that
she was responsible for his position. She also drew closer to her stepson
<b><a href="britty.html">Britannicus</a></b>,
and her support of him provided a challenge real enough to prompt retaliation.
<b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b> allegedly poisoned his stepbrother.
<b><a href="#N_34">[[34]]</a></b> After that, Agrippina was forced to move
from the imperial residence, her bodyguard was removed, and she was harassed
by a lawsuit. Her champion Pallas was dismissed from the court. <b><a href="#N_35">[[35]]</a></b>
</p><p>Nothing is known of Agrippina between 55 and 59, but she must have remained
a thorn in <b><a href="nero.html">Nero's</a></b> side as she interfered
or tried to interfere in court politics. It was still remembered that she
was a daughter of <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b>, and that
counted for much; the possibility of a union between her and a potential
usurper remained present. When she reenters the story, the necessity of
doing away with her has already been suggested; her murder was "a long-
considered crime" (<i>diu meditatum scelus</i>)<i>. </i>The immediate reason
was the same one that had surfaced earlier. She objected to <b><a href="nero.html">Nero's</a></b>
mistress. This time the liaison was with <b><a href="popsab.html">Poppaea
Sabina</a></b>, an upper-class woman with whom marriage was possible.&nbsp;
But Octavia still stood in the way. <b><a href="popsab.html">Poppaea</a></b>
had "no hope for marriage for herself or the divorce of Octavia while Agrippina
lived". <b><a href="#N_36">[[36]]</a></b> It was rumored that Agrippina
made a desperate attempt to keep <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b> in
her camp by making her own sexual advances. <b><a href="#N_37">[[37]]</a><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b>
must also have been desperate for an end to the contest of wills, for he
contrived a plan to drown her by means of a collapsible boat. Agrippina
escaped death by swimming gamely until she reached help, but she now knew
clearly that her life was in danger.
<b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b>
took more direct action and dispatched assassins to accomplish the murder.
The series of events is, however, unclear, for there are serious inconsistencies
in regard to the collapsing boat, other details of the failed plot, and
the murder itself.<b><a href="#N_38"> [[38]]</a></b> An official report
was sent to the senate: Her death had occurred when she made an attempt
on his life, not he on hers. The document also noted her past meddling
in state affairs. <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b> was congratulated
on his escape.<b><a href="#N_39"> [[39]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p></center>

<p>It is often difficult to gain a clear understanding of the personalities
of the ancient world, for the portraits of them painted in the ancient
texts are derived from layers of time-specific prejudice. When <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b>
was emperor and it was necessary that he be viewed favorably, Agrippina
was described as a negative influence. When his reputation plummeted after
his death and the Flavians rehabilitated <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius'
</a></b>capital,
she was held responsible for <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius'</a></b>
inadequacies.&nbsp; The constant theme, however, is the perception that
she was a very ambitious woman.&nbsp; The anecdote in which she asks<b><a href="gaius.html">
Gaius </a></b>to choose a name for her newborn son, retrojected on to the
narrative as it probably was, makes this point as clearly as any, for it
indicates that ambition was the driving force of her entire adult life.
The message resurfaces in the accusations of her partnering with Aemilius
Lepidus, her poisoning of Passienus Crispus, her seduction of <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius
</a></b>and
the manipulation of him in regard to the adoption of <b><a href="nero.html">Nero
</a></b>and
especially her poisoning him at the opportune moment.&nbsp; The factual
truth of all of these allegations must remain uncertain, but she was a
woman who had both the means to make a place for herself in the high-stakes
Julio-Claudian world and seemingly the will to exercise her options.&nbsp;
In the end she was overwhelmed by the weight of her competitive family.

also noted by Pliny (<i>NH</i> 7.46).
</p><p><a name="N_2"></a>[[2]] Other branches of the family could also claim
descent, direct or indirect, from Augustus, but none was so favored as
the family of Germanicus. Agrippina the Elder had a sister Julia (Julia
the Younger), whose grandchildren (the Junii Silani) would be potential
rivals under Claudius and Nero. Their credentials were somewhat tarnished,
however, by the fact that Julia herself had fallen from grace under Augustus.&nbsp;
There were also those descended from Octavia and from her daughter Antonia
Maior (an older sister of Antonia Minor); these included the father of
Nero and both mother and father of Claudius' wife Messalina. Another line
passed through the natural son of Tiberius.
</p><p><a name="N_3"></a>[[3]] The year (not the date) and the place of her
birth are uncertain because of contradictory evidence.&nbsp; Tacitus writes
that she was born at <i>oppidum Ubiorum </i>(modern Cologne, <i>Ann.</i>12.27),
but the birth may have taken place near the present city of Koblenz.&nbsp;
See Mommsen,&nbsp; Humphrey,&nbsp; Barrett,<i>Agrippina</i> (Appendix 2),
and Hurley for the arguments.

from the fact that there is no notice of it in Tacitus'<i>Annals </i>when
the text resumes in&nbsp; AD 47 after ten missing years (Barrett, <i>Agrippina,</i>
p. 85; Syme p. 328, n. 12). The allegation of poisoning (Suet.<i>Life of
Passienus</i>) may have been appended to the story only after Agrippina's&nbsp;
reputation had suffered under Nero and it was assumed that she had poisoned
Claudius. Why not an earlier husband as well?

</p><p><a name="N_33"></a>[[33]] A temple for <i>divus Claudius </i>was begun
but left unfinished until the time of Vespasian (Suet. <i>Cl. </i>45, <i>Ves.
</i>9.1).
The designation of Nero as "son of the god" appears less and less on his
coinage and on inscriptions. But he had already begun to separate himself
from his adoptive father in his first speech to the senate (Tac.<i>Ann.
</i>13.4).

could not, however,&nbsp; really have been the reason for getting rid of
Agrippina in 59. It was not until 62, three years later, that Octavia was
sent away and marriage with Poppaea took place (Tac.<i>Ann.</i> 59-64;
Suet.
<i>Ner</i>. 35.1-2; Dio 62.13.1).
</p><p><a name="N_37"></a>[[37]] By another report Nero initiated the seduction;
this would have made him, not Agrippina, the desperate party (Tac. <i>Ann.</i>14.2;
