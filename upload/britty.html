<h3>
<b>Britannicus</b></h3></center>

<center>
<h4>
Donna Hurley</h4></center>
Britannicus was born Tiberius Claudius Germanicus on February 12, AD 41,
only a few weeks after his father became the emperor <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>.
His name was changed to Tiberius Claudius Caesar Britannicus after the
Roman conquest of Britain in AD 43. In the ancient sources he is most often
simply Britannicus. He was the second child and only son of <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>
and his third wife <b><a href="valmess.html">Valeria Messalina</a></b>.
Their first child had been a daughter, <b><a href="octavia.html">Octavia</a></b>,
older by a few years. Another daughter, Antonia, had been born to <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>
and a previous wife; two other children were long dead. <b><a href="#N_1_">[[1]]</a><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>
did not celebrate the arrival of Britannicus or his subsequent birthdays
with the extravagance that might have been expected for a new prince of
the imperial house. There were other succession arrangements at the time.
<b><a href="#N_2_">[[2]]</a></b>
But as the only surviving son of a reigning emperor, Britannicus carried
a burden and a blessing. The promise of his honorific name did not guarantee
that all would go well.
<center>
<p><b>Early Life</b></p></center>

<p>The story was told that when Britannicus was a child, a physiognomist
was called in to read his character and destiny from his physical characteristics.
The pseudo-scientist declared, contrary to expectation, that Britannicus
would never be emperor but that another child who was present would someday
fill that role. The other child was <b><a href="titus.html">Titus Flavius
Vespasianus</a></b>, a boy whose father (later the emperor <b><a href="vespasia.html">Vespasian</a></b>)
was in favor in the Claudian court and who was often with Britannicus.
Clearly, this story would not have developed until a time when <b><a href="titus.html">Titus'</a></b>
principate (AD 79-81) was either realized or anticipated.<b><a href="#N_3_">[[3]]</a></b>
But there was genuine fear that the life of the young prince might not
follow a smooth course. If the aging <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>
died before Britannicus came of age, it would be difficult for him to remain
in line for the principate unless he had a protector. His mother <b><a href="valmess.html">Messalina
</a></b>tried
to solve the problem. In AD 48 she unilaterally divorced
<b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>
and secretly married Gaius Silius, consul-elect for the following year.
The idea seems to have been that he would replace <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>,
adopt Britannicus, and protect the future interests of both mother and
son. But <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b> learned of the marriage
before the plot could proceed. Both principals and a number of others were
executed. <b><a href="#N_4_">[[4]]</a><a href="valmess.html">Messalina's</a></b>
preemptive action may have been prompted by a fear that <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius'</a></b>
niece, <b><a href="aggieii.html">Agrippina the Younger</a></b>, wanted to
take her place and substitute for Britannicus her own son, <b><a href="nero.html">Lucius
Domitius Ahenobarbus</a></b>, the boy who would one day become the emperor
<b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b>.
The competition between the two minor children was obvious when <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>
arranged an equestrian display for noble youths in AD 47. Both Britannicus
and <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b> performed. The latter received greater
applause. Rumor had it that Messalina had already tried to strangle her
rival's son.<b><a href="#N_5_"> [[5]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b>Stepson of Agrippina</b></p></center>

<p>Britannicus and his sister <b><a href="octavia.html">Octavia</a></b>
survived the death of <b><a href="valmess.html">Messalina</a></b> -- for
the time being -- and <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b> lived
a while longer too. <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b> did take
<b><a href="aggieii.html">Agrippina</a></b>, the daughter of his brother
<b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b>,
as his new wife, and she brought with her to the marriage her son who was
slightly more than three years senior to Britannicus. <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>
soon adopted him and gave him the name <b><a href="nero.html">Tiberius Claudius
Nero Caesar</a></b>. The action made him his elder son and ostensibly the
preferred heir; Britannicus was now a younger brother. <b><a href="#N_6_">[[6]]
</a></b>Although
the wily <b><a href="aggieii.html">Agrippina</a></b> was said to have manipulated
her new husband into accepting this arrangement, it was in <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius'
</a></b>interest
to have a son who was closer to his majority. The prospect of orderly succession
provided protection. His direct descent from the ever-popular <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b>
was a bonus.
<b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b> was given the <i>toga virilis
</i>when
he was only 13. The token of adulthood made him ready to move into his
father's place if necessary. <b><a href="#N_7_">[[7]]</a></b>
</p><p>Britannicus was left in relative obscurity, and his education was neglected.
<b><a href="aggieii.html">Agrippina</a></b>
was accused of pushing forward her own son at the expense of her stepson.
But Britannicus still had his champions, and they pitied him because of
the treatment he received from his father and stepmother. The adoption
itself offered opportunity for conflict. Britannicus once angered <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b>
by calling him by his birth name, either Domitius or Ahenobarbus. He held
an advantage of being the emperor's natural son. On the other hand, <b><a href="valmess.html">Messalina's</a></b>
reputation for promiscuity cast doubt on his legitimacy. <b><a href="#N_8_">[[8]]</a></b>
</p><p>In AD 54, Britannicus reached the age when he too could soon be given
the <i>toga </i>of manhood and so join <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b>
as a ready successor to <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b> if necessary.
Thirteen seemed more appropriate for him than it had been for <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b>
because he was big for his age. <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>
was reported to be regretting his marriage to <b><a href="aggieii.html">Agrippina</a></b>
and changing his mind about the adoption of <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b>.
He embraced Britannicus, urged him to grow up quickly so that he could
be <b><a href="nero.html">Nero's</a></b> equal, and said that he would soon
explain all, including the slights that he had received. He also wrote
a new will, an action that suggested that he was revising his plans. <b><a href="aggieii.html">Agrippina</a></b>
became aware of this change of heart and allegedly took action: It was
inevitable that she be accused of poisoning <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>
when he died in October of AD 54. But the report that he was revising his
plans in favor of Britannicus may derive from speculation after the fact
and be an interpretation on the part of historians who needed to relieve
him of responsibility for <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b>. Shortly before
<b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>
died, he commended both boys to the protection of the senate. Perhaps he
intended for them to be joint heirs. <b><a href="#N_9_">[[9]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b>Life under Nero</b></p></center>

<p>With <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius </a></b>dead, <b><a href="aggieii.html">Agrippina</a></b>
quickly saw to it that the Praetorian Guard swore its allegiance to <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b>
while she kept Britannicus and <b><a href="octavia.html">Octavia</a></b>
out of the way. <b><a href="#N_10_">[[10]]</a></b> At first she was held
in high regard as mother of the new emperor, but
<b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b>
quickly put distance between himself and her. As a result, she turned her
attention to Britannicus, who still had his supporters. The teenagers continued
to challenge and insult one another. On one occasion <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b>
attempted to embarrass the shy Britannicus by making him sing. Britannicus
surprised by responding with a song that hinted at the wrongs that had
been inflicted on him. <b><a href="#N_11_">[[11]]</a></b>
</p><p>Within a year, <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b> thought it necessary
to be rid of Britannicus permanently. He obviously considered his brother
a genuine threat. He hired a known poisoner who first prepared a dose that
was subtle enough to disguise the cause of death, but it proved too weak.
A stronger, more effective dose eluded the tasters, and Britannicus died
quickly before the eyes of his fellow diners. <b><a href="titus.html">Titus</a></b>
was again his companion. The fatal seizure was excused as an attack of
epilepsy. Britannicus was buried immediately during a heavy rainstorm,
and an attempt was made to disguise the telltale marks of poison that were
thought to appear on his body. It was rumored that <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b>
had raped him shortly before he killed him. Special opprobrium fell on
the murderer of a virgin.<b><a href="#N_12_"> [[12]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p></center>
This was not quite the end of Britannicus' story. It was still pertinent
when the Flavian dynasty that followed <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b>
was claiming its right to the imperial tradition. This family could not
justify its position on the basis of succession to the disgraced <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b>
and so turned to <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b> instead. And
the memory of Britannicus lingered as a reminder of Claudian legitimacy
in opposition to Neronian illegitimacy. His sister <b><a href="octavia.html">Octavia</a></b>
is the heroine of the play written at some time after the death of <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b>.
It's title is titled her name, but its central message is the wrong done
to the Claudian house because of the wrong done to its last male member
and its last hope. When <b><a href="titus.html">Titus</a></b> became emperor
in 79, he set up a statue of his childhood friend.<b><a href="#N_13_">[[13]]</a></b>

mother was Aelia Paetina. Claudius was married to her before his more prestigious
match with Messalina, an event that probably took place in AD 37. Antonia
was born in 29 at the latest since she was old enough to marry in AD 41.
Claudius also had a son and daughter by his first wife, Plautia Urgulanilla.
The son, Drusus, died a pubescent youth in 24 or 25. The daughter, Claudia,
was thrown out of the house&nbsp; perhaps about the same time because Claudius
thought that not he but one of his freedmen was her father.
