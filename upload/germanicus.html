<h3>
Introduction</h3></center>
Germanicus Julius Caesar <b><a href="#N_1_">[[1]]</a></b> was born in 15
BC to <b><a href="drusus.html">Nero Claudius Drusus </a></b>(Drusus the
Elder, the son of <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus'</a></b> wife <b><a href="livia.html">Livia
</a></b>by her earlier marriage) and <b><a href="antoniaminor.html">Antonia
Minor</a></b> (Augustus' niece, the daughter of Mark Antony and his sister
Octavia). There is no record of his birth name, but it was probably that
of his father or possibly Tiberius Claudius Nero. His father's brother
(the future emperor <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>) named his
son after Drusus, and Drusus may have reciprocated. Drusus was awarded
the honorific name of Germanicus posthumously for his successful campaigns
against German tribes, and it passed to his sons when he died in 9 B.C.
Germanicus was known by that name in antiquity and has been even since.
His heritage was auspicious and his career promising, but an early death
(AD 19) kept him from achieving the prize of the principate. He nonetheless
influenced history for the next fifty years and was the father of one emperor,
the brother of another, and the grandfather of a third. <b><a href="#N_2_">[[2]]</a></b>
<center>
<h3>
Early Advancement</h3></center>
In A. D. 4, the aging <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b> found it
necessary to make another in the series of arrangements with which he expected
to provide for the continuation of the principate after his death. It would
be the last. The previous one, the adoption of his grandsons Gaius and
Lucius, failed when the young men died in AD 2 and 4. At this point he
adopted his stepson <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>, now in
his late forties, and Agrippa Postumus, his last surviving grandson, and
he had <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b> adopt Germanicus despite
the fact that <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b> had a son of his
own, Nero Claudius Drusus (Drusus the Younger), who was a few years younger
than Germanicus. Adoption changed the names of all these candidates, and
Germanicus became Germanicus Julius Caesar. <b><a href="#N_3_">[[3]]</a></b>
Experience had taught <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b> that multiple
heirs were in order. <b><a href="#N_4_">[[4]]</a></b>
<p>The settlement of AD 4 included a plan for Germanicus to marry <b><a href="aggiei.html">Agrippina
(Agrippina the Elder)</a></b>, a daughter of <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus'</a></b>
daughter <b><a href="julia.html">Julia </a></b>by <b><a href="agrippa.html">Marcus
Agrippa</a></b>. It was a productive union in more ways than one. Not only
did <b><a href="aggiei.html">Agrippina</a></b> offer the prestige of her
Julian blood to the Claudian branch of the family but she proved exceptionally
fertile, bearing Germanicus nine children in the next fourteen years. Six
survived their father. They were security for the dynasty, contributed
to Germanicus' popularity, and became players in the political intrigues
of the mid-first century. <b><a href="#N_5_">[[5]]</a></b>
</p><p>Germanicus was advanced quickly as was usual, with the young men of
the imperial family destined for important careers. He embarked on the
<i>cursus
honorum</i>, the series of magistracies that culminated in the consulship
by being allowed to stand for the quaestorship in AD 7 at the age of 20,
five years before the prescribed minimum. He skipped the next stage, the
praetorship, and proceeded directly to the consulship in 12. In the intervening
years, he held subordinate commands on the Danube frontier under his uncle
<b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius
</a></b>(AD 7-9), and was rewarded with the <i>ornmenta triumphalia</i>
(AD 9), the trappings of the triumph without the parade, and with the perquisites
of a praetor when he was in the senate. That same year <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>
was transferred to the Rhine frontier in response to the disaster that
befell P. Quinctilius Varus when he and three legions were trapped, massacred
and their standards captured at the <b><a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;teutob1.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=471&quot;)">Battle
of the Teutoburg Forest</a></b>. Germanicus joined <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>
in Germany in 11. He spent the year 12 in Rome as consul. <b><a href="#N_6_">[[6]]</a></b>
His position as second in line for the principate had strengthened. Although
<b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
was still alive, he was feeble, and <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>,
positioned to succeed him, was in his fifties, a more advanced age in ancient
Rome than it is today. One contender from Germanicus' own generation, Agrippa
Postumus, evidently impatient of his subordinate position, had fallen from
favor and was dispatched to increasingly remote places of exile after AD
6. <b><a href="#N_7_">[[7]]</a></b> The other, Drusus the Younger was advancing
in parallel but a few years behind.
</p><h3>
Command in the West</h3>
So far, Germanicus had been fighting as a deputy of <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>,
but in 13 <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus </a></b>made him governor of
Upper and Lower Germany, west of the Rhine, administratively part of Gallia
and Belgica. With the appointment came the command of eight legions, four
attached to each province. <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b> died
in August of AD 14, and the stability of the Empire was tested by the first
transfer of power. Mutinies stemming from grievances about pay and discharge
broke out simultaneously on the Danube and German frontiers, and the legionaries
in the West used the uncertainty of events in Rome to offer their allegiance
to Germanicus, who was the man on the spot. They offered to swear to him
as their new <i>imperator</i> rather than to <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>.
Germanicus extricated himself by means that were less than admirable, although
in his defense it can be said that the situation was tense and very difficult.
To his credit he refused to accept their oath of allegiance, but when he
tried to quiet them by threatening suicide, some (to his embarrassment)
moved to accept his offer. His solution was essentially to pay them off;
he effected it by forging a letter from <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>
that gave them all that they wanted. But unrest continued, for when <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius'</a></b>
envoys came from Rome, they were almost killed because the soldiers understood
that the letter was a forgery and thought that the envoys intended to nullify
the promises that Germanicus had made. Threats were made against his wife
and son <b><a href="gaius.html">Gaius</a></b> (Caligula) who were with him
at his headquarters. Germanicus had to bargain with them to allow his pregnant
wife to depart for safer quarters. When it was over, he chose a coward's
method of discipline when he turned them loose on one another to settle
scores for themselves. Finally, he diverted them with a brief military
excursion. <b><a href="#N_8_">[[8]]</a></b>
<p>Germanicus was nonetheless a popular leader. Loyalty to a field commander
was usually a given, his connections with <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
were helpful, and the display of his small son dressed like a little soldier
(<b><a href="gaius.html">Caligula</a></b> = "Little Boots") was an effective
public relations gambit. During the next two years Germanicus made major
incursions into German territory east of the Rhine following the example
of his father's campaigns of 12-9 BC. In AD 15 he marched against the Chatti
and then against the Cherusci led by the charismatic chieftain Arminius.
In the course of the campaign, one of the standards lost with Varus' legions
was recovered, important symbolically because it reversed the shame of
the legion's annihilation. When they found themselves in the region of
the Teutoburg Forest, the site of the massacre, they buried the Roman bones
that has been left there. The Germans harassed the Romans as they returned
to the safety of the Rhine and their winter camps beyond. Roman invasions
of Germany were always indecisive, because Rome was never able to hold
territory against an enemy that faded away after defeat only to return.
The terrain was wooded and often water-logged, and the Germans had the
tactical advantage of maneuverability. <b><a href="#N_9_">[[9]]</a></b>
</p><p>In the spring of the next year (AD 16) Germanicus went east again, this
time embarking his force on ships that sailed down the Rhine and then through
the canal that had been engineered by his father Drusus a generation earlier
in order to enter on the North Sea. From there they sailed East to the
mouth of the river Ems and proceeded upstream to penetrate German territory.
They then marched eastward to the river Weser, crossed it and engaged Arminius
in battle at a site named Idistaviso. The Roman victory there marked the
nominal submission of all the tribes west of the river Elbe, an important
boundary because it was the furthest penetration of his father's incursion
in 9 BC. The Romans were successful (as always) against the Germans in
pitched battle, but (as always) this was not a permanent territorial conquest.
Germanicus sent most of his force back by way of the same water route as
they had come, and they were caught in a costly storm on the North Sea.
By the end of the campaigning season the legions were in their winter quarters
west of the Rhine, but not before a second of the three standards lost
with Varus had been recovered. <b><a href="#N_10_">[[10]]</a></b>
</p><p>In the meantime, Germanicus had been granted a full triumph by <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>.
It was the last that any general who was not a reigning emperor would be
given and even then was reserved for someone close to the throne. The award
was made in AD 15, but Germanicus delayed coming home to celebrate it and
continued to operate in the field through 16; allegedly he wanted to keep
on later still. The triumph took place on May 26, AD 17, and his five living
children rode with him in the parade as an advertisement for a long an
stable future. <b><a href="#N_11_">[[11]]</a></b> Tacitus intimates that
<b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>
had brought him back to Rome because he did not trust him at the head of
a large military force and that he had substituted the honor of the triumph
for the field command. Popular perception assumed that Germanicus was a
threat to his adoptive father. In reality, <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>
may have understood that indecisive stabs east of the Rhine were a futile
waste of resources and that it was time to stop. As for Germanicus' anticipating
the principate, he could be patient; <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>
was now almost sixty. And he had already resisted temptation once. <b><a href="#N_12_">[[12]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<h3>
Command in the East</h3></center>
In 18, Germanicus was consul again, and this time he shared the honor with
the emperor, a distinction reserved for an intended heir. When he entered
office, he was already on his way to a new command in the East. <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>
had given him <i>maius imperium</i> over the territory east of the Adriatic,
a command that was not limited geographically but superseded the authority
of all the governors in the area. The need for the extraordinary power
was dictated by the unsettling effect of power struggles within Rome's
client territories of Asia Minor and also by the necessity of giving Germanicus
a responsibility commensurate with his status. Germanicus approached his
new base (Antioch in the imperial province of Syria) by way of a grand
tour of the eastern Mediterranean, touching on Actium, the site of the
final showdown between his great-uncle <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
and his grandfather Mark Antony, on Athens, and on the site of ancient
Troy. Along the way, Agrippina gave birth on the island of Lesbos to their
last child, Julia Livilla. <b><a href="#N_13_">[[13]]</a></b>
<p>Once in Syria Germanicus quickly came into conflict with Cn. Calpurnius
Piso, whom <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b> had appointed as
governor of that province at the time when Germanicus received <i>maius
imperium</i>. Piso was "a man of intractable temper with family history
of hostility to the Caesars," <b><a href="#N_14_">[[14]] </a></b>and in
Germanicus he recognized the beginnings of hereditary monarchy. Each probably
thought that the other was exceeding his jurisdiction, and their wives
acted out their rivalry. Piso's wife (Munatia) Plancina reviewed military
maneuvers in answer to what can be assumed to be <b><a href="aggiei.html">Agrippina's
</a></b>display
of her son <b><a href="gaius.html">Gaius</a></b>, who had evidently been
brought along in order to replay the success that he had had as 'little
boots' with the troops on the German frontier. The rumor arose that <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>
had appointed Piso for the specific purpose of monitoring Germanicus. <b><a href="#N_15_">[[15]]</a></b>
</p><p>Germanicus fulfilled his mandate to display a Roman presence in the
area and to settle internal affairs. In the client kingdom of Armenia,
he crowned Artaxias, who was a friendly ally, and installed the first Roman
governor of the new province of Cappadoccia. <b><a href="#N_16_">[[16]]</a></b>
In AD 19, he left Asia Minor and visited Egypt. He went, it was said, in
response to famine but the trip included a sightseeing tour, rather in
the spirit of his initial journey to the East. He was warmly received when
he moved unpretentiously among the populace and especially when he opened
the doors of the grain storehouses. He was displaying <i>civilitas</i>
(citizen-like behavior) and <i>liberalitas</i> (generosity), virtues associated
with imperial largesse. He was upstaging <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>.
He was either oblivious to the effect of his behavior or he was intentionally
testing the waters. His action was aggravated by the fact that all men
of senatorial rank were strictly forbidden to set foot in Egypt, which
was under the emperor's personal control.<b><a href="#N_17_"> [[17]]</a></b>
His visit and his grandstanding there, if arguably appropriate for the
'almost-emperor' that he was, understandably irked the actual emperor.
<b><a href="#N_18_">[[18]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<h3>
Germanicus' Death and the Trial of Piso</h3></center>
When Germanicus returned to Syria at the end of summer, he found that Piso
had undone arrangements that he had made and was harassing his party of
aides and advisors. Hostility became open, and Germanicus renounced <i>amicitia</i>
(friendship) with Piso, banished him from his company, and may have ordered
him from his post and from the province as well. Piso claimed that he had.
If he did he was arguably within the authority of his <i>maius imperium</i>
although Piso was <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius'</a></b> appointee.
In any case, Piso did abandon his command. He went to an island off the
coast so that he could return if the opportunity should arise. It seemed
possible since Germanicus had fallen ill shortly after his return from
Egypt. He suspected that Piso had cursed him by placing devotional objects
(human remains, lead tablets and the like) in his house and was in the
process of poisoning him. <b><a href="#N_19_">[[19]]</a></b>
<p>Germanicus died in Antioch on October 10, AD 19. Rumor had it that his
corpse bore marks of poison: black and blue marks, foaming at the mouth,
a heart that would not burn on the funeral pyre. Eulogies compared him
with Alexander, who had died at the same age. <b><a href="#N_20_">[[20]]</a></b>
His aides in Syria appointed Cn. Sentius to fill the post abandoned by
Piso. Piso reasserted himself and tried to regain the governorship, claiming
that Germanicus had forced him from the province illegally in order to
be free to attempt a coup against <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>.
His reentry to Syria with a military force was easily countered and he
was sent back to Rome to stand trial for treason. <b><a href="#N_21_">[[21]]</a></b>
</p><p><b><a href="aggiei.html">Agrippina </a></b>returned to Rome with her
husband's ashes early the next year (AD 20), coming home accompanied by
the two children who were with her, <b><a href="gaius.html">Gaius</a></b>
(Caligula) and the baby Julia Livilla. There are reports of overwhelming
grief in Rome; the people had looked forward to a new <i>princeps</i> to
whom they could attach their emotions. At the present, they had only <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>,
who seems to have been genuinely oblivious to the need to act the role
of nurturing monarch, a role already expected in the young Empire. Germanicus'
ashes were placed in the mausoleum of <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
and there was a lengthy period of mourning. But what gave closure to Germanicus'
story was the trial of Piso. <b><a href="#N_22_">[[22]]</a></b>
</p><p>Germanicus' circle lost the focus of their hopes when he died, for he
took with him their expectation of being close to the center of power in
the near future. Those who had been with him in the East returned to Rome
and were waiting to challenge Piso and Plancina, who came back bluffing
their innocence of any kind of wrongdoing. Piso was tried in the senatorial
court as was appropriate since the wronged party was the emperor's son.
The primary charge was treason -- insubordination and the inciting of sedition
-- with an additional charge of poisoning. The prosecution's case in regard
to poison was weak, but Piso was manifestly guilty of treason. When he
saw that his case was lost, he killed himself before the trial ended. His
wife was cleared through the influence of her close friend <b><a href="livia.html">Livia</a></b>,
<b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius'</a></b>
mother. <b><a href="#N_23_">[[23]]</a></b>
</p><p>Tacitus gives the fullest report of the trial, and his account has been
proved essentially accurate by a recently discovered bronze tablet which
gives the official version of the trial and its result. <b><a href="#N_24_">[[24]]</a></b>
The issue was indeed treason, not poison, and <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>
was concerned to appear impartial. Tacitus departs from the official version
with the addition of a rumor that Piso had in his possession a letter from
<b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>
instructing him in regard to Germanicus and that he intended to show it
to the senate and implicate
<b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>
in what had taken place in Syria. He further implies that Piso's death
might not have been a suicide but an execution to prevent the disclosure.
In a sense the bronze tablet corroborates Tacitus' innuendo, for the careful
and detailed report that was set up in every legionary camp in the Empire
shows the unpopular <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b> on the defensive
and confirms that the trial was a crisis for him. <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>
now faced a truly difficult rival. Dead, perhaps martyred, Germanicus remained
a formidable force in Roman politics. <b><a href="#N_25_">[[25]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<h3>
Legacy</h3></center>
The successor's mantle now fell on Drusus, <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius'</a></b>
natural son. But where were those to look who had pinned their future careers
to Germanicus? His oldest sons, Nero and Drusus Caesar, were about 15 and
13, and <b><a href="aggiei.html">Agrippina</a></b> held determinedly to
her husband's memory for their sakes. When Drusus died a few years later
(AD 23), these two were heirs prospective although still young and vulnerable
to the ambitions of older men. But a new force had arisen in the court.
L. Aelius Sejanus, the praetorian prefect (chief officer of the palace
guard) was becoming more and more indispensable to the emperor. As the
result of intrigue whose details cannot be recovered, <b><a href="aggiei.html">Agrippina</a></b>
and her oldest son were exiled by 29. By 30, her second son had been arrested.
By 33 all, (including Sejanus) were dead. It was Germanicus' early death
that generated the nasty politics of these years. <b><a href="#N_26_">[[26]]</a></b>
<p>The next two emperors, <b><a href="gaius.html">Caligula</a></b> (37-41)
and <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b> (41-54), Germanicus' son
and brother respectively, used him as a surrogate with the legions where
personal loyalty to a commander was paramount, evoking his name relentlessly
in order to trade on his still glowing reputation. They had become emperor
only because they belonged to the imperial family; <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
and <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>, on the other hand, had
military accomplishments that earned them the title <i>imperator</i> legitimately.
Germanicus was the 'dynastic lynch-pin' between the Julian and Claudian
branches of the family, <b><a href="#N_27_">[[27]]</a></b> and <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>
especially needed him for a closer connection with <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>.
And even thirty years after his death,<b><a href="nero.html"> Nero's</a></b>
direct descent (his mother <b><a href="aggieii.html">Agrippina the Younger</a></b>
was Germanicus' daughter) was still an asset.
</p><p>What would a principate of Germanicus have been like? There is no way
to know, although there was not much promise in his ineffectual responses
during the mutiny on the Rhine or his strangely conceived trip to Egypt.
Some, perhaps most, of the adulation accorded him when he was alive was
reaction to the unresponsive <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>.
Much more came from the fact that he had the good fortune to die young
and permit legend to take over. If he had succeeded <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>,
he would have been the first of the Julio-Claudian princes reared to the
purple to put on the mantle of the principate. As it turned out, the opportunity
was given <b><a href="gaius.html">Caligula</a></b>.
