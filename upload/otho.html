</p><center>
<h3>
Introduction</h3></center>
In January 69 Otho led a successful coup to overthrow the emperor <b><a href="galba.html">Galba</a></b>.
Upon advancing to the throne, he hoped to conciliate his adversaries and
restore political stability to the Empire. These ambitions were never to
be realized. Instead, our sources portray a leader never fully able to
win political confidence at Rome or to overcome military anarchy abroad.
As a result, he was defeated in battle by the forces of <b><a href="vitell.html">Vitellius</a></b>,
his successor, and took his own life at the conclusion of the conflict.
His principate lasted only eight weeks.<b><a href="#N_1_">[[1]]</a></b>
<center>
<h3>
Early Life and Career</h3></center>
Marcus Salvius Otho was born at Ferentium on 28 April 32 A. D. His grandfather,
also named Marcus Salvius Otho, was a senator who did not advance beyond
the rank of praetor. Lucius Otho, his father, was consul in 33 and a trusted
administrator under the emperors <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>,
<b><a href="gaius.html">Gaius</a></b> and
<b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>.
His mother, Albia Terentia, was likely to have been nobly born as well.
The cognomen "Otho" was Etruscan in origin, and the fact that it can be
traced to three successive generations of this family perhaps reflects
a desire to maintain a part of the Etruscan tradition that formed the family's
background.<b><a href="#N_2_">[[2]]</a></b>
<p>Otho is recorded as being extravagant and wild as a youth - a favorite
pastime involved roving about at night to snare drunkards in a blanket.
Such behavior earned floggings from his father, whose frequent absences
from home on imperial business suggest little in the way of a stabilizing
parental influence in Otho's formative years. These traits apparently persisted:
Suetonius records that Otho and <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b> became
close friends because of the similarity of their characters; and Plutarch
relates that the young man was so extravagant that he sometimes chided
<b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b> about his meanness, and even outdid
the emperor in reckless spending.<b><a href="#N_3_">[[3]]</a></b>
</p><p>Most intriguing in this context is Otho's involvement with <b><a href="nero.html">Nero's</a></b>
mistress, Poppaea Sabina, the greatest beauty of her day.<b><a href="#N_4_">[[4]]</a></b>
A relationship between the two is widely cited in the ancient sources,
but the story differs in essential details from one account to the next.
As a result, it is impossible to establish who seduced whom, whether Otho
ever married Poppaea, and whether his posting to Lusitania by <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b>
should be understood as a "banishment" for his part in this affair. About
the only reliable detail to emerge is that Otho did indeed become governor
of Lusitania in 59, and that he assumed the post as a quaestor, a rank
below that of praetor or consul, the minimum usually required for the office.<b><a href="#N_5_">[[5]]</a></b>
From here he would launch his initial thrust towards the imperial throne.
</p><center>
<h3>
Overthrow of Galba</h3></center>
<b><a href="nero.html">Nero's</a></b> suicide in June 68 marked the end
of the Julio-Claudian dynasty and opened up the principate to the prerogatives
of the military beyond Rome. First to emerge was <b><a href="galba.html">Servius
Sulpicius Galba</a></b>, governor of Hispania Tarraconensis, who had been
encouraged to revolt by the praetorians and especially by <b><a href="sabinus.html">Nymphidius
Sabinus</a></b>, the corrupt and scheming praetorian prefect at Rome. By
this time Otho had been in Spain for close to ten years. His record seems
to have been a good one, marked by capable administration and an unwillingness
to enrich himself at the expense of the province. At the same time, perhaps
seeing this as his best chance to improve his own circumstances, he supported
the insurrection as vigorously as possible, even sending <b><a href="galba.html">Galba</a></b>
all of his gold and his best table servants.<b><a href="#N_6_">[[6]]</a></b>
At the same time, he made it a point to win the favor of every soldier
he came in contact with, most notably the members of the praetorian guard
who had come to Spain to accompany <b><a href="galba.html">Galba</a></b>
to Rome. <b><a href="galba.html">Galba</a></b> set out from Spain in July,
formally assuming the emperorship shortly thereafter. Otho accompanied
him on the journey.
<p><b><a href="galba.html">Galba</a></b> had been in Rome little more than
two months when on 1 January 69 the troops in Upper Germany refused to
declare allegiance to him and instead followed the men stationed in Lower
Germany in proclaiming their commander, <b><a href="vitell.html">Aulus Vitellius</a></b>,
as the new ruler. To show that he was still in charge <b><a href="galba.html">Galba</a></b>
adopted his own successor, Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi Licinianus, an
aristocrat completely without administrative or military experience. The
choice meant little to the remote armies, the praetorians or the senate
and particularly angered Otho, who had hoped to succeed <b><a href="galba.html">Galba</a></b>.<b><a href="#N_7_">[[7]]</a></b>
Otho quickly organized a conspiracy among the praetorians with promise
of a material reward, and on 15 January 69 they declared him emperor and
publicly killed <b><a href="galba.html">Galba</a></b>; Piso, dragged from
hiding in the temple of Vesta, was also butchered. On that same evening
a powerless senate awarded Otho the imperial titles.
</p><center>
<h3>
Otho's Principate in Rome</h3></center>
It is not possible to reconstruct a detailed chronology of Otho's brief
eight and a half weeks as
<i>princeps</i> in Rome (15 January-15 March).
Even so, <b><a href="galba.html">Galba's</a></b> quick demise had surely
impressed upon Otho the need to conciliate various groups. As a result,
he continued his indulgence of the praetorian guard but he also tried to
win over the senate by following a strict constitutionalist line and by
generally keeping the designations for the consulship made by <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b>
and <b><a href="galba.html">Galba</a></b>. In the provinces, despite limited
evidence, there are some indications that he tried to compensate for
<b><a href="galba.html">Galba's
</a></b>stinginess by being more generous with grants of citizenship. In
short, Otho was eager not to offend anyone.<b><a href="#N_8_">[[8]]</a></b>
<p>Problems remained, however. The praetorians had to be continually placated
and they were always suspicious of the senate. On the other hand, the senate
itself, along with the people, remained deeply disturbed at the manner
of Otho's coming to power and his willingness to be associated with <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b>.<b><a href="#N_9_">[[9]]</a></b>
These suspicions and fears were most evident in the praetorian outbreak
at Rome. Briefly, Otho had decided to move from Ostia to Rome a cohort
of Roman citizens in order to replace some of Rome's garrison, much of
which was to be utilized for the showdown with <b><a href="vitell.html">Vitellius</a></b>.
He ordered that weapons be moved from the praetorian camp in Rome by ship
to Ostia at night so that the garrison replacements would be properly armed
and made to look as soldierly as possible when they marched into the city.
Thinking that a senatorial counter-coup against Otho was underway, the
praetorians stormed the imperial palace to confirm the emperor's safety,
with the result that they terrified Otho and his senatorial dinner guests.
Although the praetorians' fears were eventually calmed and they were given
a substantial cash payment, the incident dramatically underscored the unease
at Rome in the early months of 69.<b><a href="#N_10_">[[10]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<h3>
Otho's Offensive against Vitellius</h3></center>
Meanwhile, in the Rhineland, preparations for a march on Rome by the military
legions that had declared for <b><a href="vitell.html">Vitellius</a></b>
were far advanced. Hampered by poor intelligence gathering in Gaul and
Germany and having failed to negotiate a settlement with <b><a href="vitell.html">Vitellius
</a></b>in early 69, Otho finally summoned to Italy his forces for a counterattack
against the invading Vitellian army. His support consisted of the four
legions of Pannonia and Dalmatia, the three legions of Moesia and his own
imperial retinue of about 9,000. <b><a href="vitell.html">Vitellius'</a></b>
own troops numbered some 30,000, while those of his two marshals, Aulus
Caecina Alienus and Fabius Valens, were between 15,000 and 20,000 each.<b><a href="#N_11_">[[11]]</a></b>
<p>Otho's strategy was to make a quick diversionary strike in order to
allow time for his own forces to assemble in Italy before engaging the
enemy. The strategy worked, as the diversionary army, comprised of urban
cohorts, praetorians and marines all from Rome or nearby, was successful
in Narbonese Gaul in latter March. An advance guard sent to hold the line
on the Po River until the Danubian legions arrived also enjoyed initial
success. Otho himself arrived at Bedriacum in northern Italy about 10 April
for a strategy session with his commanders. The main concern was that the
Vitellians were building a bridge across the Po in order to drive southward
towards the Apennines and eventually to Rome. Otho decided to counter by
ordering a substantial part of his main force to advance from Bedriacum
and establish a new base close enough to the new Vitellian bridge to interrupt
its completion. While en route, the Othonian forces, strung out along the
via Postumia amid baggage and supply trains, were attacked by Caecina and
Valens near Cremona on 14 April. The clash, know as the <b><a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;bd_ari69.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=472,height=528&quot;)">Battle
of Bedriacum</a></b>, resulted in the defeat of the Othonian forces, their
retreat cut off by the river behind them. Otho himself, meanwhile, was
not present, but had gone to Brixellum with a considerable force of infantry
and cavalry in order to impede any Vitellian units that had managed to
cross the Po.
</p><p>The plan had backfired. Otho's strategy of obtaining victory while avoiding
any major battles had proven too risky. Realizing perhaps that a new round
of fighting would have involved not only a significant re-grouping of his
existing troops but also a potentially bloody civil war at Rome, if
<b><a href="vitell.html">Vitellius'</a></b>
troops reached the capital, Otho decided that enough blood had been shed.<b><a href="#N_12_">[[12]]</a></b>
Two weeks shy of his thirty-seventh birthday, on 16 April 69, he took his
own life.<b><a href="#N_13_">[[13]]</a></b>
</p><h3>
Assessment</h3>
To be sure, Otho remains an enigma - part profligate Neronian wastrel and
part conscientious military commander willing to give his life for the
good of the state. Our sources are at a loss to explain the paradox. Perhaps,
like Petronius, he saw it was safer to appear a profligate in Nero's court?
In the final analysis, Otho proved to be an organized and efficient military
commander, who appealed more to the soldier than to the civilian. He also
seems to have been a capable governor, with administrative talents that
recalled those of his father. Nevertheless, his violent overthrow of <b><a href="galba.html">Galba</a></b>,
the lingering doubts that it raised about his character, and his unsuccessful
offensive against <b><a href="vitell.html">Vitellius</a></b> are all vivid
reminders of the turbulence that plagued the Roman world between the reigns
of <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b> and <b><a href="vespasia.html">Vespasian</a></b>.
Regrettably, the scenario would play itself out one more time before peace
and stability returned to the empire.
