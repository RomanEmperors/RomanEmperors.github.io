<b>Livia (Wife of Augustus)</b></h3></center>

<center>
<h4>
Donna Hurley</h4></center>
<p></p>

<center><b>Introduction</b></center>

<p>Livia, as history most often knows her,<b><a href="#N_1_">[[1]] </a></b>was
the wife of <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b> for over fifty years,
from 38 BC until his death in AD 14 , an astonishingly long time in view
of life expectancy in ancient Rome. Although certainty about their inner
lives and proof for what we would consider a loving relationship is necessarily
lost to us, we can infer genuine loyalty and mutual respect between the
two. They remained married despite the fact that she bore him no child.
Livia's position as first lady of the imperial household, her own family
connections, her confident personality and her private wealth allowed her
to exercise power both through <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
and on her own, during his lifetime and afterward. All the Julio-Claudian
emperors were her direct descendants: <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>
was her son; <b><a href="gaius.html">Gaius (Caligula)</a></b>, her great-grandson;
<b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>,
her grandson; <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b>, her great-great-grandson.
</p><center>
<p><b>Ancestry and Marriage to Octavian</b></p></center>

<p>Livia was born Livia Drusilla in 58 BC<b><a href="#N_2_">,[[2]]</a></b>
the daughter of M. Livius Drusus Claudianus and Alfidia. Her mother, evidently
the daughter of a magistrate from an Italian town, did not have an impressive
pedigree. Her father, on the other hand, was born Appius Claudius Pulcher
and was adopted as an infant by M. Livius Drusus, tribune in 91 BC. Livia
thus carried the blood and prestige of both the <i>Livii </i>and the patrician
<i>Claudii</i>,
families long accustomed to power.<b><a href="#N_3_">[[3]]</a></b> Livia
had a second connection with the <i>gens Claudia</i> as well. Her first
husband was Ti. Claudius Nero, and by him she had two children. Her first
son, who would become the emperor <b><a href="tiberius,htm">Tiberius</a></b>,
was born in 42 BC, and carried his father's name. She was six months pregnant
with a second son when she married <b><a href="auggie.html">Julius Caesar
Octavianus&nbsp;</a></b> (who would be known as <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>&nbsp;
after 27 BC) on January 17, 38 BC, and she soon produced Nero Claudius
Drusus, sometimes referred to as "Drusus the Elder". Her first husband
Nero was a willing participant in this transfer of his wife and was present
at the wedding banquet. Livia had been granted exemption from the obligatory
ten-month waiting period required of a widow or divorced woman before remarriage
on the grounds that Nero and her new husband had agreed on the coming child's
paternity. In order to be free from his fist marriage, <b><a href="auggie.html">Octavian</a></b>
divorced his first wife Scribonia, who had just given birth to a daughter,
Julia, who would be his only natural child. When Nero died a few years
later, both of Livia's sons came to live with her and her husband.<b><a href="#N_4_">[[4]]</a></b>
</p><p>Despite the fact that Livia was a beautiful young woman with whom <b><a href="auggie.html">Octavian</a></b>
was supposed to have fallen quickly in love and that the two seem to have
lived happily together ever after,<b><a href="#N_5_">[[5]]</a></b> their
marriage was, at bottom, political. During the civil strife that followed
the murder of Julius Caesar, her first husband Nero had joined the party
of the assassins and fought at Phillippi. After the Republicans were defeated
there, he turned to the party of Mark Antony, specifically to Antony's
brother L. Antonius, and then, after the fall of Perusia in 40, fled to
Sicily where Sex. Pompey was attracting remnants of Rome's upper class.
From there he and Livia and their small son <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>
moved on to Greece. Amnesty for adherents of Antony allowed them to return
to Rome in 39. <b><a href="auggie.html">Octavian</a></b>, the "rising sun",
needed connections with aristocrats like Nero to provide an aura of Republican
respectability to his growing power, and marriage to Livia secured it.
She brought to this union not only her Livian and Claudian ancestry but
also her two sons, <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b> and Drusus,
heirs of the distinguished Claudii Nerones. As for <b><a href="auggie.html">Octavian</a></b>,
he no longer needed Scribonia because Pompey, with whom she had a family
connection,<b><a href="#N_6_">[[6]]</a></b> no longer had to be conciliated.
The ancient sources do not speculate about Livia's feelings, but she was
probably happy to be joined with a younger man of such overwhelming promise.
Nero, newly pardoned by <b><a href="auggie.html">Octavian</a></b>, did not
have a real choice, but he was aware that it did not hurt to bestow his
wife on Rome's ascendant power. Everyone gained by the arrangement<b><a href="#N_7_">.[[7]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b>The Wife</b></p></center>

<p>By all accounts, Livia played the role of a loving, dutiful and even
old-fashioned wife. She cooperated with <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus'
</a></b>encouragement
of upper-class women to behave in the austere fashion of an earlier age
when she and other female members of his household spun and wove and provided
him with clothing. She sometimes accompanied him when he traveled from
Rome and always served as a trusted confidante and advisor. When a beloved
great-grandson of Augustus died (a son of <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b>,
a toddler named <b><a href="gaius.html">Gaius</a></b>), she saw to it that
the child's statue was placed in his private quarters.<b><a href="#N_8_">[[8]]</a></b>
She ignored his notorious womanizing, and so Tacitus called her an "easy
wife". "When someone asked her how and by what course of action she had
obtained such a commanding influence over Augustus, she answered that it
was by being scrupulously chaste herself, doing gladly whatever pleased
him, not meddling with any of his affairs, and, in particular, by pretending
neither to hear of nor to notice the favorites that were the objects of
his passion".<b><a href="#N_9_">[[9]]</a></b> Her tolerance need not surprise.
The goal of a Roman marriage was the formation of a household and the production
of children, not sexual gratification, which could be found elsewhere.
Unfortunately, she never bore him any living children; a premature infant
died.<b><a href="#N_10_">[[10]]</a></b> Heirs would have been desirable,
and it is a tribute to their relationship that <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
did not divorce her because she failed to produce them. The two were a
partnership.
</p><p>The claim, however, that she did not meddle in his affairs is disingenuous.
The dutiful wife, who appeared in public only as a model of traditional
propriety, exercised a great deal of private power. In 35 BC, Livia received
her first official marks of status, the right to manage her own affairs
(i.e., control her own financial resources) without a guardian and a grant
of <i>sacrosancitas</i>, the inviolability that tribunes enjoyed; it gave
her the same protection that <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b> had.
She also received a public statue, an honor almost unique for a woman at
that time. In 9 BC a second statue followed, ostensibly intended to console
her on the recent death of her son Drusus and to call attention to her
as a mother of important sons. Both <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>
and Drusus had become more prominent because of their military commands.
At the same date she was given the <i>ius liberorum,
</i>the collection
of rights given the mothers of four children, although she already possessed
the emancipation that it conferred. It was further reference to her maternal
role.<b><a href="#N_11_">[[11]]</a></b>
</p><p>Livia was wealthy in her own right and had her own circle of clients
whom she rewarded. She launched the career of M. Salvius Otho, the grandfather
of the <b><a href="otho.html">Otho </a></b>who would be emperor briefly
in&nbsp; AD 69. He lived in her house, and it was through her favor that
he entered the senate. She secured the consulate for M. Plautius Silvanus,
son of her close friend Urgulania. The marriage of her grandson, the future
emperor <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>, to Plautius' daughter
Urgulanilla was presumably the result of her influence as well. Most importantly,
she had her husband's ear and he had hers. On one occasion she petitioned
citizenship for a Gaul, and although her request was not granted, <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
awarded the man an alternate prize. The story about her recommending clemency
for the alleged conspirator Cn. Cornelius Cinna is a fiction , but it developed
to illustrate her power of persuasion.<b> </b>It was her wealth, her good
looks and her intelligence, combined with the status of her husband, that
made her role possible.<b><a href="#N_12_">[[12]]</a></b>
</p><p>But it was within the family that Livia exercised her greatest influence,
and it was for this reason that history assigned&nbsp; her the role of
wicked stepmother, ambitious for her own sons at the expense of other members
of the household. She was  a terrible mother for the state as a mother,
a terrible stepmother for the house of the Caesars. <b><a href="N_13_">[13]</a></b>
As events evolved, it is easy to see how this idea came to be. <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
first tapped his nephew C. Claudius Marcellus, the son of his sister Octavia,
as his successor by marrying his daughter Julia to him. Marcellus died
young in 23 BC, and rumor would later make Livia complicit in his death.
M. Vipsanius Agrippa, <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus'</a></b> foremost
ally in power, now became the designated heir after marriage to Julia cemented
the arrangement. During the same period, marriage was arranged between
<b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius
</a></b>and
Vipsania, Agrippa's daughter, and this union kept Livia's family close
to anticipated future power. It was only after the death of Agrippa in
12 BC that opportunity opened for her own sons and she could realistically
be thought fostering their and her own ambition.<b><a href="#N_14_">[[14]]</a></b>
But the role of designated heir was still not in the picture for her sons.
</p><p><b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b> had already, in 17 BC (even
before their father was dead), adopted Gaius and Lucius, the two oldest
sons of Agrippa and Julia, and they were clearly intended as the princes
of the new generation. Julia was next married to <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>
(11 BC), and he was intended as a substitute for the boys until they were
old enough to seem like plausible successors. This arrangement held no
particular advantage for him, and furthermore it proved unsuccessful.<b><a href="tiberius.html">
Tiberius</a></b> took himself off to the island of Rhodes in 6 BC and in
2 BC Julia, back in Rome, got in trouble by taking lovers and was exiled
for adultery. When Gaius and Lucius died (AD 4 and 2 ), it would naturally
be hinted that Livia had a hand in their deaths since their removal left
the way clear for <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>. In one more
arrangement of his succession plans, the last as it turned out, Augustus
adopted <b><a href="tinerius.html">Tiberius</a></b> in 4 after seeing to
it that<b><a href="tiberius.html"> Tiberius</a></b> first adopted <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b>,
the son of his deceased brother Drusus. At the same time, <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
himself adopted Agrippa Postumus, the last son of Agrippa and Julia; Postumus
was not yet ready for the principate nor would he ever be. It would seem
that the scheming stepmother had at last succeeded and was now the mother
of the presumptive princeps. But it was circumstance that made <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>
the only one left on his feet at the end. The rumors came later.<b><a href="#N_15_">[[15]]</a></b>
</p><p>The perception that Livia was ambitious for her son made it possible
for her to be accused of complicity in <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus'</a></b>
death. The rumor developed that she had smeared poison on figs still on
a tree and then guided him to pick one of these for himself while she selected
untainted ones.<b><a href="#N_16_">[[16]]</a></b> Her motivation came from
the fear that <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b> might retrieve from
exile his one remaining adopted son, Agrippa Postumus, and that Postumus
might be a rival of <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>. Postumus
was executed shortly after <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b> died,
at whose order, it is unclear.<b><a href="#N_17_">[[17]]</a></b> Although
it is implausible that Livia poisoned <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>,
the accusation shows how strongly she came to be perceived as championing
her offspring at any cost. Further suspicion fell on her when she failed
to announce <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus'</a></b> death immediately
after it occurred. The military saluted <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>
on the spot, before it became known that the emperor had died. This was
necessary because, although he no longer had a rival within the family,
the senate might not confirm for him the unofficial position that <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
had held. It was better if the succession had been accomplished.<b><a href="#N_18_">[[18]]</a></b>
Suetonius, in a report completely different from the poisoning story, describes
a loving and trusting relationship between Livia and <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
at the end. The emperor's last words were 'Live mindful of our wedlock,
Livia and farewell", and he died as he kissed her.<b><a href="#N_19_">[[19]]</a></b>
This detail is probably no more accurate than the poisoned figs, but it
represents a second role assigned her. Her reputation was double: dutiful
wife and ambitious schemer.
</p><center>
<p><b>The Mother</b></p></center>

<p>After <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b> was cremated, Livia remained
with the knights when they gathered his bones and took them to the Mausoleum.
She, as well as <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>, publicly authored
all the honors paid him. She joined him in building a shrine for the now
deified <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b> and established games
in his honor. It was she who paid Numerius Atticus to say that he had seen
him ascend to heaven. By the terms of <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus'
</a></b>will,
she received one-third of his estate and <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>
two-thirds. It was unusual for a woman to inherit to this degree, and the
money would be a major source of her continuing influence. The will further
provided for her adoption into the <i>gens Iulia</i> and the honorific
<i>Augusta</i>.
She became known as Julia Augusta. The adoption did not change her legal
position but it did serve to legitimize the position of
<b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>,
who was an adopted Julian and now became a naturalized one as well. The
title <i>Augusta </i>would continue to be given women of the imperial family
who had a role in the line of succession.<b><a href="#N_20_">[[20]] </a></b>Livia
was appointed a priestess in <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus'</a></b>
newly established cult and, like a vestal, the right to a lictor when she
performed her duties. Later it would be deemed treasonous to speak against
her (AD 20 ), and once after she recovered from a serious illness (22),
thanksgiving offerings were made and an altar was voted her. For a time,
letters were addressed to both her and <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>
as though she were co-regent, and her name was on the letters that he sent.
In 24 she was given a seat among the Vestals in the theater.<b><a href="#N_21_">[[21]]</a></b>
</p><p>Livia remained an influential figure. She saved Q. Haterius from <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius'</a></b>
anger and showed favor to <b><a href="galba.html">Ser. Sulpicius Galba</a></b>,
who would become emperor after the death of <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b>,
and rewarded him generously in her will; <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>,
however, ignored her instructions and <b><a href="galba.html">Galba</a></b>
never received the money. She was behind the rise of C. Fufius Geminus
to the consulship, although he was accused of treasonous behavior after
she died. Her friendship raised Urgulania "above the law". But the clearest
demonstration of her unofficial but very real power was apparent with her
rescue of her friend Plancina, the wife of Cn. Calpurnius Piso, who was
accused of complicity in insurrection and poisoning at the time when Germanicus
died (AD 19 ). Piso, who took his own life under pressure of the trial,
was posthumously found guilty of treason, but both Plancina and her son
were allowed to retain their wealth and status. Livia's influence in the
affair is confirmed by the recently discovered <i>senatus consultum de
Cn. Pisone patre</i>, an inscription that made public the official resolution
of the trial. Plancina had been pardoned "by the request of [Tiberius]
mother"<b><a href="#N_22_">[[22]]</a></b> <b><a href="gaius.html">Gaius</a></b>,
who followed <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b> in the principate,
lived with Livia when he was young. He called her <i>Ulixes stolatus</i>,
a "Ulysses in a matron's dress",<b><a href="#N_23_">[[23]]</a></b>
<br>a strong and manipulative woman.
</p><p>But, despite all this, things were not the same for Livia after <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus'</a></b>
death. She lost her role as advisor. Her son was not her husband; <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>
was not <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>. There were rumors that
the new emperor resented her influence and her claims of eminence. He took
exception to the senate's heaping of honors on her, to her being titled
"mother" or 'parent of the country" and especially, it would seen, to himself
being named "son of Livia" or "son of Julia" on the analogy of "son of
Augustus". He did not allow her the lictor to which she was entitled nor
an altar to celebrate her adoption. On the occasion when she assisted him
in supplying fire relief (AD 16), he resented her action; <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>,
on the other hand, would presumably have welcomed her help. <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>
was allegedly angered by the assumption that it was she who had procured
his position for him, and so he put distance between himself and her. She
was said to have taunted him with the thought that <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
had preferred <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b>. It was rumored
that he left Rome for Capri (AD 26) in order to avoid her. Indeed, he only
saw her once more after he departed and then briefly. He did not go to
her during her final illness, nor did he attend her funeral. After she
died, he forbade the deification proposed for her and disregarded her will.
Neither the altar voted her when she was ill in 22 nor a commemorative
arch was ever built. <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b> did not
bar all honors, however. She continued to be included in annual prayers,
and she received the use of the honorary conveyance, the <i>carpentum</i>.<b><a href="#N_24_">[[24]]</a></b>
</p><p>Reports of deep hostility between them<b><a href="#N_25_">[[25]]</a></b>
paint too simple a picture.<b> </b>Although it seems reasonable to assume
that <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b> reacted negatively to the
rumors that his mother was a kingmaker and that these rumors would have
blossomed as he became progressively a less popular personality, his withholding
of excessive honors for her and his self-imposed distance are consistent
with what is known of his personality. "The emperor repeatedly asserted
that there must be a limit to the honors paid to women, and that he would
observe similar moderation in those bestowed on himself"<a href="#N_26_">.<b>[[26]]</b></a>
And indeed he did. <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b> was more
the Republican aristocrat than the emperor. Livia, however, had lived over
fifty years as an important, if unofficial, player in the power game and
as an empress. It was difficult for her to fade away. If she tried to influence
<b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>
as she had <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>, resentment and a cooling
of affection might reasonably have followed. As time when on, <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>
took his advice not from his mother but from his praetorian prefect, L.
Aelius Sejanus, and as Sejanus' influence rose, Livia's seems to have fallen.
Still, there was no sharp division between friendly and unfriendly periods
in their relationship and she continued to receive overt marks of respect<b><a href="#N_26_">.</a><a href="#N_27_">[[27]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b>Death</b></p></center>

<p>Livia died in AD 29 at the advanced age of 86. She received a public
funeral, although a relatively modest one, and was buried in the Mausoleum
of <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>. <b><a href="gaius.html">Gaius</a></b>
delivered the eulogy. It would be he, her great-grandson, who, when he
became emperor, finally paid the bequests that she had provided for in
her will and&nbsp; that <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b> had
ignored. When the senate proposed divine honors,&nbsp; <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>,
consistent with his past practice, forbade them. Her grandson <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>
would oversee her long-deferred deification in 42. Women were to name <i>diua
Augusta</i> in their oaths; she received an elephant-drawn chariot to convey
her image to the games; a statue of her was set up in the temple of <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>;
races were held in her honor.<b><a href="#N_28_">[[28]]</a></b> The woman
who played an important role in two principates joined the imperial pantheon
at last. Tacitus' obituary calls her "An imperious mother and an amiable
wife, she was a match for the diplomacy of her husband and the dissimulation
of her son",<b><a href="#N_29_">[[29]]</a><a href="#N_28_"> </a></b>a concise
statement of the reputation that she left behind.

about her life are three histories, those of Tacitus (<i>Annals, </i>books
1-6), Velleius Paterculus (book 2, 75-130), and Cassius Dio (books 48-58),
and the collection of imperial biographies by Suetonius<i>, </i>primarily
those of <i>Augustus

other authors. The <i>Senatus consultum de Cn. Pisone Patre</i> (published
by Eck and others) provides confirmation of Livia"s influence.
