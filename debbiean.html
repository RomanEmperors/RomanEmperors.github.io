<h3>Indo-European Studies Bulletin: A Case Study for Publishing with 
XML and Unicode</h3>

</p></center>

<h4>Background to the Problem</h4>

<p>Ancient Greek and Latin are two members of the large group of 
ancient Indo-European
languages, whose geographical spread stretched from 
Europe to Asia in antiquity. Indo-European
studies incorporate the study of this group of 
the ancient related tongues, their linguistic
prehistory (and later developments), their 
cultures, and the archaeological remains that might be
associated with Indo-European-speaking peoples.  </p>

<p>Because the field of Indo-European spans so 
many different languages and cultures, doing
research necessitates access to a wide variety 
of primary and secondary materials, including many
small European publications. However, the 
current "crisis in the libraries" has meant that
escalating prices for books and journals has 
restricted the libraries' ability to keep up with serial
and monograph purchases. So how can one do 
adequate research, if the libraries are on a fixed
budget and they are not able to purchase all 
needed materials, other than having one rely on
interlibrary loan? The problem is hardly 
restricted to Indo-European studies: Classicists and those in other
fields of the humanities (and even in the 
sciences) can find this true as well. For those in poorer
countries, the problem can be even more dire. </p>

<p>If the Internet can make materials accessible 
for free or at a reduced cost to a wider audience, then
it could be an effective means of scholarly 
communication. This depends, of course, on users
having access to a computer hooked up to the 
Internet, with the appropriate software and
hardware installed. </p>

<h4>Outline of Project </h4>

<p>As a means of making Indo-European materials 
more accessible to scholars in the US and abroad,
I have devised a project in conjunction with the 
Electronic Text Unit of the UC Berkeley Library
to test Web publication for Indo-European studies. 
Initial seed-funding was provided by Bryn Mawr
Reviews. The project is intended to examine 
whether electronic journal publication is a viable
alternative to print for Indo-European and 
those smaller fields, especially where publications are
being produced by small societies or university 
departments. The single most challenging aspect of
the project is how to display (and print) a wide 
variety of scripts.</p>

<p>The publication being put online is the 
<em>Indo-European Studies Bulletin</em>, a small journal affiliated
with the UCLA Indo-European Studies Program. 
The publication now has a small but 
ever-growing base of subscribers. It is 
formally affiliated with a support group at UCLA, so any money
remaining after the publishing and mailing 
costs are met goes to support an annual IE
conference and to bring speakers to UCLA. 
Those scholars in Eastern Europe, mainland China,
and the former Soviet Union can receive the 
<em>Bulletin</em> gratis, in the belief that promoting scholarly
communication to scholars in these areas is 
of primary importance and the expense to the group is
justified.</p>

<p>The project is intended to look at the following questions:
</p><ul>
<li>How difficult is it to produce an electronic version? 
What is the best method?
</li><li>Are there easy-to-use affordable tools for creating 
an electronic journal in this field?
</li><li>What costs are involved?
</li><li>Can the costs be covered and still offer the 
publication at a low price (or free)?
</li><li>On the more practical side: Can the 
electronic version be accessed by those using older
equipment?</li></ul>

<h4>Other Electronic Journals</h4>

<p>Examining how other multilingual electronic 
journals have been set up can be instructive, since
they have also had to deal with the pesky 
problem of getting the various languages to appear and
print correctly. A review of the other 
electronic journals shows currently a 
dearth of titles in Indo-European, particularly 
in Indo-European linguistics.  Classics, on the other hand, has a more
sizable number of electronic journals. (Classics 
is defined here the broad sense of classical
literature, linguistics, history, and archaeology.)  
Of the titles found, a growing number are free
publications, often put out by a university 
department or society (e.g., 
<a href="https://www.ucd.ie/~classics/ClassicsIreland.html"><em>Classics 
Ireland</em></a>, affiliated
with the Classical Association of Ireland and 
put out by University College Dublin). 
Of the free titles listed on various e-journal lists (e.g.,
<a href="https://gort.ucsd.edu/newjour/">https://gort.ucsd.edu/newjour/</a>), 
some ceased publication after a few issues (e.g., 
<a href="https://www.cisi.unito.it/arachne/arachne.html"><em>Arachnion</em></a>).

</p><p>Perhaps the most rapidly growing sector 
of electronic journals are electronic versions of
established print titles. While a few large 
publishers are doing the electronic version themselves
(such as Johns Hopkins), many others are 
using "service providers" to produce and distribute
them. </p>

<p>Three formats are predominantly used in 
electronic journal publication.</p>
<ol>
<li>The most common type of format being 
used for the electronic version is Adobe's Portable
Document Format (PDF). This proprietary format 
is easy to use and embeds the fonts so that the
documents are readable from any computer platform, 
as long as the free Adobe Acrobat Reader
has been downloaded. The online version mirrors 
the print publication. There are two drawbacks
to PDF: 
<ul><li>you can't search for some of the "odd" 
(non-ASCII) characters, and
</li><li>since it isn't
an international "standard," longevity is 
not necessarily guaranteed.</li></ul></li></ol>

<li>The other format of choice for online 
journals is HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language,
which has become the standard for the Web. 
It is appearing more frequently in electronic journal
publication, probably because it allows greater 
capabilities, such as active linking to the
bibliography, footnotes, to other articles, 
etc. The drawback to HTML is that it provides a
restrictive set of tags and is limited to a 
fixed, simpler type of document. HTML does allow the
possibility of including multiple scripts 
and searching for characters in these scripts.

</li><li>A third type of publication should be 
mentioned, and that is the use of text-only or "plain text"
(=ASCII). This format appears in the email 
versions of the <em>Bryn Mawr Classical Review </em>and
<em>Medieval Review</em>. By using the 
plain text Beta Code to encode Greek, these publications are
accessible to all and searchable, although 
it doesn't render the original Greek script (and one
needs to know the transliteration scheme).

<h4>Format Choices for <em>IES Bulletin</em> Project</h4>

<p>A number of important developments have taken 
place on the Web, specifically the creation of a
new standard to replace HTML, XML, Extensible 
Markup Language. Because XML provides the
ability to include markup for content 
(and is less complex than its parent, SGML), allows the
tagset to be extended (hence "extensible"), 
and is now supported by the latest version of the
popular browsers (Internet Explorer 5+, 
Netscape 6/Mozilla), we decided to use XML for the <em>IES
Bulletin</em>. A second motivating factor 
was to see what kinds of problems would arise when
working with Indo-European material in XML. 
For guidelines on markup (and DTD), we used the
Text Encoding Initiative's TEI-Lite.  XML 
also requires Unicode, the universal character
encoding standard.  In Unicode, every character 
receives its own unique number, irrespective of
computer system, software program, etc. Such a 
standard is a necessity for working in multiple
languages, for in the past the variety of 
encoding schemes made it difficult to transmit
multilingual documents across the web easily without 
problems. As an example, compare what
happens when converting a final sigma from 
GreekKeys to WinGreek (drawn from the example by
Sean Redmond, "Greek Font to Unicode Converter", at
<a href="https://www.jiffycomp.com/smr/unicode/convert.php3">https://www.jiffycomp.com/smr/unicode/convert.php3</a>): 
Final sigma in GreekKeys becomes an
omega in WinGreek. This occurs because they 
were encoded differently. In Unicode, no matter
what computer platform or software program, 
the final sigma should appear as such when
transmitted to others (as long as the fonts on 
the sending and receiving end are Unicode-compliant 
and both have Unicode-enabled operating systems and browsers).</p>

<h4>Methodology</h4>

<p>The following description provides a synopsis 
of the methodology being used for creating the
print version. First, we convert all articles 
from authors into Microsoft Word (if not already in this
format) and then do the editing. The text is 
then imported into PageMaker for formatting and final
proofing before the final print version is 
created and sent to the printer. The online version is
created by using a plain text version of the 
PageMaker file. It is inserted into the XML skeleton
and edited with Emacs. After the file is parsed 
against the TEI-Lite Document Type Definition, or
DTD, we then turn to a product which Berkeley 
currently owns, DynaWeb, to "make book,"
which allows one to create HTML on the fly. It 
also offers a number of nice features, such as
searching. However, at $75,000, it is unrealistic 
to see DynaWeb as a product that all but a few
large institutions can afford.</p>

<h4>Problems</h4>

<p>We have at present converted a number of the 
<em>Indo-European Studies Bulletin</em> issues online.
Some significant problems have turned up. Since 
the goal of the project was to see what kinds of
problems arose - and not necessarily to bypass 
them in an effort to publish quickly - it was deemed
important to examine them.</p>
<ol>
<li>Some scripts appearing in our issues are not 
included in the Unicode Standard. For example,
one article discusses Sabellian, a language group 
on the Italic peninsula. The characters in the
native script are not yet in the Unicode Standard. 
Because the length of time from the first
proposal to the Unicode Technical Scripts Committee 
until acceptance is about three to five years
and publication deadlines are more immediate, a 
short-term solution is required. There are a
variety of approaches available:
<ul><li>One of the simplest means is to use an 
image, such as a GIF, in its place, though it can't be
searched. This method has been used in our publication.
</li><li>A second approach to use a transliteration/transcription 
scheme (with ASCII), which can be
used as long as a note is appended defining the 
scheme. (This is commonly done on e-mail and in a
few Web publications. It would, of course, fail to 
show the original script.)
</li><li>A third solution is to create a font with 
the characters (including the non-Unicode characters in
the "Private Use Area" set aside by the Unicode 
Standard), and let users download and install the
font before viewing the document. (This is done 
for the TITUS materials, as well as for another
big project, the Leiden Etymological Database.) 
Perhaps this offers the best solution, since it
allows searching. However, good cross-platform 
fonts that are free have not yet been created.
</li><li>Using PDF is another possibility, but, as 
mentioned above, it doesn't allow character searching
for many non-ASCII characters and is in a proprietary format.
</li><li>The final option is that of "dynamic fonts," 
whereby a font is embedded into a webpage and
delivered to the user with the font in it. (I 
mention this only in passing, since Netscape reports that
it is no longer supporting dynamic fonts.) 
Microsoft has an equivalent called WEFT (Web
Embedding Fonts Tool). </li></ul>

<p>Although I have outlined the short-term solutions 
for displaying missing characters, I would like
to add that this doesn't solve the long-range 
problem, namely, that such scripts should be included
in Unicode, since Unicode ultimately aims to cover 
all the dead (and living) languages of the
world. Unfortunately, I have discovered that 
there has been a lack of participation from scholars in
reviewing Unicode proposals, which is regrettable, 
since it is scholars who are most likely to use
and benefit from the inclusion of various dead 
languages in the Unicode Standard. Also, the
Technical Director of the Unicode Technical 
Committee has stated (e-mail communication,
10/28/00), that "[t]here are powerful, 
countervailing forces within the [computer] industry and
among standardization circles that would 
prefer that the Unicode Standard stop changing and
expanding, since adaptation to such change is 
expensive and unsettling." In other words, the time
may soon come when no additional historic languages 
may be accepted because of feelings
amongst Unicode Consortium members. Hence it is 
important to continue to pursue the inclusion
of these scripts now, and to provide feedback on 
any errors or missing characters in the repertoire.
(In this regard, I have been directly involved 
in getting an Old Italic proposal into Unicode, as well
as those for Linear B and cuneiform.) Since ancient 
scripts are needed ultimately for Indo-European 
online publication and research, working on Unicode 
proposals has become a new focus
of the project. </p>

<p>  However, in order to get Unicode to work 
there are a number of requirments you need: 
</p><ul><li>the
latest browser (Internet Explorer 5+ or Netscape 
6/Mozilla), set to "Unicode" (or "UTF-8");
</li><li>a
Unicode-compliant font installed on your machine;
</li><li>an operating system that supports Unicode,
i.e., Apple Mac OS 9.0, Mac OS X Server, Mac OS X, 
Microsoft Windows CE, Windows NT,
Windows 2000. (For a list of Unicode-enabled products, see
<a href="https://unicode.org/unicode/onlinedat/products.html">https://unicode.org/unicode/onlinedat/products.html</a>.)</li></ul>

<p>Because our project aims at providing access to 
a wide audience, requiring these three
components of all users seems like a tall 
order. Since the main browsers (IE, Netscape) are
available for free download, this is not too 
troublesome. The font problem could be resolved, if
the needed fonts could be created and downloaded 
for free (or made available for a nominal
amount). Requiring a user to have a new or recent 
operating system, particularly for those
scholars with restricted funding, is more problematic, 
especially since the new operating systems
are currently adding in more and more support for 
Unicode with each new version of the
operating system. Probably a PDF version should be 
offered in the interim as an option, since this
allows easy access and printing capabilities for 
those with older machines. </p>

</li><li>In order to mark up the languages in XML, 
you need a language tag. While the majority of
basic languages are covered (such as Ancient 
Greek, Old English, Middle English), a number are
not. I have been in contact with members of 
the Unicode committee and Peter Constable of SIL,
who recommended that those working with dead 
languages maintain a single list of the language
codes to be agreed upon and used amongst scholars. 
Eventually these can be used to apply for
registration to the relevant international body. 
The question of having the requisite language tags
is relevant because, for example, in displaying 
ancient Greek dialects, some dialects use different
letter shapes. The language tag can be used to 
select the correct font, so the correct shape will
appear.

</li><li>Another problem surfaced in a recent issue: 
How to handle marking the underdot for unsure
reading, a common sign in epigraphy and papyrology. 
A group at Oxford is working on a proposal
for symbols to be included in the Unicode Standard 
and the TLG at Irvine is also assembling a list.
Originally we had used the Unicode "combining 
underdot" for the unsure reading. However, the
Unicode Technical Committee members have 
pointed out that it would be better to handle it
differently, since the underdot has a specific 
phonetic meaning in many languages (e.g., a vocalic r
in Sanskrit), but here indicates
something different. This particular problem needs to be
discussed more widely amongst those working 
with old documents and the character encoding
standards committees: otherwise there will be inconsistency.

</li><li>The cost of DynaWeb at $75,000 is prohibitive 
for all but a few large institutions. One very
likely possibility is for us to convert to 
Cocoon, a open-source program from apache.org. (The
Perseus text-hopper might be another option.)</li></ol>

<h4>Other Issues </h4>

<p>A number of issues have yet to be examined:</p>

<ul><li>In what way can peer-review be easily managed?
</li><li>Will offering an online version mean a significant 
loss of revenue? Will the print publication
cease to exist, as occurred to <em>BMCR</em>? This 
brings up the dichotomy between "free access for all"
and the need to be able to pay costs, while providing 
funds for the UCLA support group's efforts. 
Potential models could include charging for the current 
issue only, and making only past issues free.
Should the entire issue be free? Or should only 
"highlights" or abstracts be made available at no
cost? These issues still need to be discussed and resolved.</li></ul>

<h4>The Future</h4>

<p>Future work will entail converting the remaining 
back-issues of the <em>IES Bulletin</em> to an online
format, noting any further problems that arise with 
XML and Unicode. Eventually finding an
inexpensive alternative to DynaWeb will be necessary. 
Continued discussion of how to handle
character encoding/text markup issues (e.g., the 
underdot for unsure reading) and the creation of a
"Best Practices" guide would be a desideratum, 
as would a guidebook on how to produce an
online publication for small departments and 
societies in the humanities.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>Will our efforts in online journal publishing 
ultimately help in making more IE materials
accessible? I hope so. Our work up to this point 
has really concentrated on making the Internet
infrastructure more amenable to handling various 
ancient languages. The standards and open-source 
programs do provide a means for smaller departments 
and societies to publish online,
although we can't recommend yet how these should 
be paid for. Still, we are poised to 
improve scholarly access and communication greatly 
with the Internet, and I think this opportunity should
be taken up.  However, without input from scholars 
(especially regarding standards), the ability to
do research and publish over the Internet could be 
seriously compromised.</p>
