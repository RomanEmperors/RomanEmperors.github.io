<p><strong><em><span class="text-2xl"><span face="Times">THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE ROMAN PEOPLE</span></span></em></strong></p>

<p><strong><span class="text-2xl"><span face="Times">Translated by Thomas M. Banchich and Jennifer A. Meka</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span face="Times">Canisius College Translated Texts, Number 2</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">Canisius College, Buffalo, New York</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">2001</span></p>

<p><strong><span class="text-2xl"><span face="Times">INTRODUCTION</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span face="Times">In the fall of 2000, I suggested to my student, Jennifer Meka, the collaborative production of a
translation into English -- the first, to my knowledge -- of Festus' late 4th-century A.D.
<em>Breviarium</em>.<a href="#N_1_"><b>[[1]]</b></a>  Ms. Meka agreed, and, after some initial reservations, I decided to take as our text
the edition of Carl Wagener rather than either of the more recent ones of Eadie and Arnaud-Lindet or the older one of Foerster.<a href="#N_2_"><b>[[2]]</b></a> 
The initial phase of this project involved my rough, literal
rendering into English of chapters I-XVII, and Ms. Meka's of XVIII--XXX.  We next worked
through the <em>Breviarium</em> from its beginning, with an eye to regularizing our treatment of certain
words and phrases.  My colleagues David Coffta, David Dietz, and Madeleine Kaufman offered
advice and assistance on several matters.  After a series of intermediate versions, I decided on the
final form our work would take.  I also compiled an index of personal names.  The idiosyncrasies
and shortcomings of the translation and index should, therefore, be laid at my door.</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">Our translation attempts to stay as close to the Latin of Wagener's edition as possible.  Thus,
when that text prints Roman numerals, we render them as Arabic numbers; when it prints Latin
words for numbers, we employ English words.  We retain names of individuals as Wagener
printed them, even when that means writing "Sylla" for "Sulla" or, at XI.2, the obviously incorrect
"Mummius" for Gnaeus Manlius Vulso.  However, some names have been anglicized, some not. 
The index that follows our translation should eliminate any resultant confusion.  Likewise, when
dealing with the names of peoples as opposed to places, we try to mirror Festus' uses of adjectives
as opposed to abstract nouns.  Names of peoples are usually, though not always, anglicized -- so
<em>Sicilii</em> are Sicilians, but <em>Albanii</em> become Albanii rather than Albanians.  <em>Imperator</em>, <em>princeps</em>, and<em>
prases </em>are transliterated rather than translated.  Rarely, Festus' spelling of a place name has been
altered -- <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., Rhodope for Rhodopa.  <em>Dicio</em> we render "sway," <em>amicitia</em> "good offices," and <em>fides</em>
"protection."  We have tried to reproduce Festus' syntax, even where, as in XXV.2 and XXVIII.3,
for example, this required convoluted English.  Our translation employs Wagener's numbering
system and prints in bold face within brackets the pagination of his edition.</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">  Special thanks is due to Michael DiMaio of Salve Regina University, who agreed to include our
translation in the <em>De Imperatoribus Romanis</em> Historical Source Index and who saw to the
technical matters necessary to bring this about. </span></p>

<p><strong><span class="text-2xl"><span face="Times">NOTES</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span face="Times"><a name="N_1_"></a>[[1]]There have been several published translations of Festus into French: Nicolas Auguste Dubois'
(Paris: C. L. F. Panckoucke, 1843), Dèsirè Nisard's (Paris: F. Didot, 1860), and, most recently,
the Budè edition of Marie-Pierre Arnaud-Lindet, <em>Abrègè des hauts faits du peuple romain
</em>(Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1994).  Dubois, p. 11, mentions a German translation by F. Ficker,
though it is unclear whether this was actually published, and Reinhart Herzog (see below), p. 207,
cites the German version of F. Hoffman, included with translations into German of M. Valerius
Messalla Corvinus and Lucius Ampelius (Stuttgart: 1830).  Vincentio Belprato's rendering
(Florence: Bernardo Giunti, 1550) was perhaps the first Italian Festus.  Michael H. Dodgeon and
Samuel N. C. Lieu's<em> The Roman Eastern Frontier and the Persian Wars (AD 226-263)</em> (London
and New York: Routledge, 1991), included English translations of those portions of the
<em>Breviarium</em> relevant to its concerns.</span></p>

<p><strong><em><span class="text-2xl"><span face="Times">OF </span></span></em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em><span class="text-2xl"><span face="Times">THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE ROMAN PEOPLE</span></span></em></strong></p>

<p><span face="Times">I.  Your Clemency enjoined that a summary be made.  To be sure, I, in whom the facility of
broader discourse is lacking, shall comply happily with what has been enjoined.  And, having
followed the fashion of accountants, who express immense sums through fewer numbers, I shall
indicate, not explicate, past events.  Receive, therefore, what has been succinctly summed up in
very concise sayings, so you may seem, most glorious <em>Princeps</em>, not so much to recite as to
enumerate to yourself the years and duration of the state and the events of yore. </span></p>

<p><span face="Times"> II.  From the foundation of the city to the rise of Your Perpetuity, by which Rome has been
allotted a very prosperous <em>imperium</em> of brothers, are reckoned 1,117 years.  Thus, under kings are
reckoned 243 years; under consuls, 467 years; under <em>imperatores</em>, 407 years.  2.  For 243 years,
kings, seven in number, reigned in Rome.  Romulus reigned 37 years; senators for five days and
one year; Numa Pompilius reigned 43 years; Tullus Hostilius reigned 44 years; Ancus Marcius
reigned 24 years; Priscus Tarquinius reigned 38 years; Servius Tullius reigned 44 years; Lucius
Tarquinius Superbus was expelled in the twenty-fourth year of his reign.  3.  From Brutus and
Publicola to Pansa and Hirtius there were 916 consuls, beyond those who were those chosen as
replacements in the same year by some allotment, through four hundred and sixty-seven years. 
For nine years, consuls were lacking in Rome, thus: for two years Rome was under decemvirs, for
three years under military tribunes, and for four years without magistrates.  4.  From Octavian
Caesar Augustus to Jovian, there were <em>imperatores</em>, 43 in number, through 407 years.      </span></p>

<p><span face="Times"><b>[2]</b>  III.  Therefore, how much Rome has advanced under these three types of rule -- that is,
regnal, consular, and imperial -- I shall briefly sketch.  Under seven kings through 243 years,
Roman <em>imperium</em> did not advance beyond Portus and Ostia, within 18 miles from the gates of the
city of Rome, seeing that she was as yet small and founded by shepherds, while neighboring cities
were hemming her in.  2.  At the same time, through 467 years under consuls, among whom there
sometimes were dictators, too, Italy was occupied as far as beyond the Po, Africa was subjugated,
the Spains added, and Gaul and Britain made tributaries.  As for Illyricum, Histri, Libyrni, and
Dalmatae were mastered; it passed to Achaea; Macedonians were subjugated; with Dardanians,
Moesians, and Thracians it warred; and it reached all the way to the Danube.  3.  After Antiochus
had been expelled, Romans first set foot in Asia; when Mithridates had been conquered, his
kingdom was occupied; Armenia Minor, which he likewise had held, was obtained by arms; a
Roman army reached Mesopotamia; a treaty was initiated with the Parthians; against Carduenians
and Saracens and Arabs it warred; all of Judaea was conquered; Cilicia and Syria came into the
power of the Roman people.  Egypt's kings became allies.  4.  Moreover, under the <em>imperatores</em>,
through 407 years, while many <em>principes</em> were directing the diverse fortune of the state, the
Maritime Alps, Cottian, Raetian, and Norican Alps, the Pannonias, and the Moesias accrued to the
Roman world, and the entire bank of the Danube was reduced to provinces.  All Pontus, Armenia
Major, all <em>Oriens</em>, with Mesopotamia, Assyria, Arabia, and Egypt, passed under the jurisdiction of
Roman <em>imperium</em>.</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">IV.  Moreover, in what order the Roman state acquired individual provinces is described below. 
Sicily was made first of the provinces.  When Hiero, King of the Sicilians, had been defeated,
Marcellus obtained her.  Then directed by praetors, she afterward was committed to <em>praesides</em>;
now she is administered by consulars.  <strong>[3]</strong>  2. Metellus conquered Sardinia and Corsica; he
celebrated a triumph over the Sardinians; the Sardinians have often rebelled.  There had come to
be a joint administration of these islands; afterward praetors held them; now they are ruled
individually by <em>praesides</em>.  3.  Roman arms were sent across to Africa for the defense of the
Sicilians.  Thrice Africa rebelled; in the end, after Carthage had been destroyed by Sicipio
Africanus, she was made a province; now she functions under proconsuls.  4.  Numidia used to be
held by friendly kings, but war was declared against Jugurtha because of the murder of Adherbal
and Hiempsal, sons of King Micipsa; and after he had been worn down by the consul Metellus and
captured by Marius, Numidia came into the power of the Roman people.  The Mauretanias were
obtained from Bocchus.  But, with all Africa subjugated, King Juba was still holding the Moors --
he who, after he had been conquered by Augustus Caesar in the course of the civil war,
voluntarily committed suicide.  5.  Thus did the Mauretanias begin to be ours and six provinces
were made through all Africa; Africa itself, where Carthage is, is proconsular, Numdia consular,
Byzacium consular, Tripolis and the two Mauritanias -- that is, Sitifensis and Caesariensisóare
praesidal.</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">V.  Through Scipio we first bore aid to Spaniards against the Africans.  We obtained the rebelling
Lusitanians in Spain through Decimus Brutus and we attained the sea from Gades to Ocean. 
Afterward, Sylla, having been dispatched against the Spaniards, who were in an uproar, conquered
them.  2.  The Celtiberians in Spain often rebelled, but, when Scipio the Younger had been
dispatched, they were, with the destruction of Numantia, subjugated.  Nearly all Spain was
brought under sway through Metellus and Pompey on the occasion of the Sertorian War;
afterward, when his <em>imperium</em> had been extended for five years, they were subdued by Pompey. 
3.  Ultimately, too, the Cantabrians and Asturians, who, relying on the mountains, were resisting,
were destroyed by Octavian Caesar Augustus.  4.  And now through all Spain there are six
provinces: Tarraconensis, Carthaginensis, Lusitania, Gallaecia, Baetica, also across the strait in the
soil of African land is a province of the Spains, which <strong>[4]</strong> is named Tingimauritania.  Of these,
Baetica and Lusitania are consular, the others praesidal.</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">VI.  With the Gauls the Roman people had the gravest wars.  For the Gauls also used to hold the
part of Italy in which Mediolanum now is as far as to the Rubicon River, trusting in a number of
men so great that in a war they assailed Rome herself, and, when the Roman armies had been
destroyed, entered the walls of the city and besieged the Capitolium, to the citadel of which 600
most noble senators had fled: it was these who ransomed themselves from the siege with 1000
pounds of gold.  Afterward, Camillus, who was in exile, with a multitude gathered from the fields,
defeated the Gauls as they were returning with victory; the gold and standards which the Gauls
had taken he brought back.  2.  Many consuls, praetors, and dictators contended with the Gauls
with varied result.  Marius drove the Gauls from Italy; when the Alps had been crossed, he battled
successfully against them.  3.  C. Caesar, with ten legions which had 3,000 Italian soldiers each,
over nine years subjugated the Gauls from the Alps as far as to the Rhine, battled with barbarians
settled beyond the Rhine, crossed to Britain, and, in the tenth year, made the Gauls and Britains
tributaries.  4.  There are in Gaul, Aquitania, and the Britains eighteen provinces: the Maritime
Alps, the province of Viennensis, Narbonensis, Novempopulana, two Aquitanias, the Graiean
Alps, Maxima Sequanorum, two Germanies, two Belgicas, two Lugdunenses; in Brittania,
Maxima Caesariensis, Flavia Caesariensis, Brittania Prima, and Brittania Secunda.</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">VII.  From the shore of the sea, we gradually moved on Illyricum.  The consul Laevinus, having
first entered the Adriatic and the Ionian Sea, obtained the coastal cities.  Crete was made a
province by the proconsul Metellus, who was called "Creticus."  2.  When Greeks were seeking
succor in our protection, we came to Achaea.  The Athenians sought our aid against Philip, King
of the Macedonians.  For a while Achaea was free under our good offices; finally, when
ambassadors of the Romans had been done violence at Corinth, after Corinth had been captured
by the proconsul Lucius Mummius, all Achaea was obtained.  3.  The Epirotes, who once with
Pyrrhus <strong>[5]</strong> the king had even presumed to cross to Italy, and the Thessalians, when they had been
conquered, were added together with our territories of Achaea and Macedon.  4.  Macedonia
thrice rebelled -- under Philip, under Perseus, under Pseudo-Philip.  Flamininus defeated Philip,
Paulus Perseus, Metellus Pseudo-Philip, by whose triumphs Macedonia was joined to the Roman
people.  5.  The Illyrians, who had borne aid to the Macedonians, we conquered on that same
occasion through Lucius Ancius, a praetor, and we received them, with King Gentius, in
capitulation.  Curio, a proconsul, subjugated the Dardanians and Moesiacians and was the first
commander of Romans to penetrate all the way to the Danube.  6.  Under Julius Octavian Caesar
Augustus, a road was made through the Julian Alps; when all the Alpini had been conquered, the
provinces of the Norici were added.  After Batho, King of the Pannonians, had been subdued, the
Pannonias came under our sway.  After the Amantians between the Save and Drave had been laid
low, the area adjoining the Save and environs of Pannonia Secunda were obtained.</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">VIII.  The Marcomanni and Quadi were driven from the environs of Valeria, which are between
the Danube and Drave, and a frontier between Romans and barbarians was established from
Augusta Vindelicum through Noricum, Paennonia, and Moesia.  2.  Trajan conquered the
Dacians, under King Decibalus, and made Dacia, across the Danube in the soil of barbary, a
province which in circumference had ten times 100,000 paces; but it was lost under <em>Imperator</em>
Gallienus, and, after Romans had been transferred from there by Aurelian, two Dacias were made
in the regions of Moesia and Dardania.  3.  Illyricus has 18 provinces: two of Noricas, two of
Pannonias, Valeria, Savia, Dalmatia, Moesia Superior, Dardania, two of Dacias, and in the
Macedonic diocese are seven provinces: Macedonia, Thessaly, Achaea, two Epiruses, Praevalis,
and Crete.</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">IX.  It was run across to Thrace on the occasion of the Macedonian War.  The Thracians were the
most savage of all races.  The Scordisci, equally cruel and cunning, also used to dwell in the
environs of Thrace.  Many tales are told about the savagery of their divinatory rites, that to their
own gods they sometimes made sacrifices of prisoners, that <strong>[6]</strong> they were accustomed to drink
human blood in skulls.  2.  A Roman army was often destroyed by them.  Marcus Didius checked
the wandering Thracians, Marcus Drusus confined them within their own borders, Minucius
annihilated them in the ice of the Hebrus River.  Through Appius Claudius, a proconsul, those
who used to inhabit Rhodope were conquered.  Earlier a Roman fleet obtained the coastal cities of
Europe.  Through Thrace, Marcus Lucullus first clashed with the Bessi.  3.  The head of our race
conquered Thrace herself.  He subjugated the Haemimontani, Eumolpiada -- which is now called
Philippopolis -- , Uscudama -- which presently is called Hadrianopolis -- he brought under our
sway, he took Cabyle.  He occupied cities situated above Pontus: Apollonia, Calathum,
Parthenopolis, Tomi, and Hister; reaching all the way to the Danube, he displayed Roman arms to
the Scythians.  4.  Thus were the six provinces of Thrace added to the sway of our state: Thrace,
Haemimontus, Moesia Inferior, Scythia, Rhodope, and Europa, in which now have been
established the secondary defenses of the Roman world.</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">X.  Now the Eastern parts and the entire <em>Oriens</em> and the provinces simply located in the vicinity,
which have furnished authors for your scepters, I shall explicate, so that the interest of Your
Clemency, which you have in these same being preserved, may be more amply aroused.  2.  Asia
became known to the Romans through the partnership of King Attalus, and we took possession of
it by the law of inheritance, when it had been bequeathed in Attalus' will.  Nevertheless, lest the
Roman people should hold anything not obtained by strength, it was delivered by means of arms
by us from Antiochus, the Syrians' greatest king.  3.  On the same occasion, Lydia, ancient seat of
kings, Caria, Hellespontus, and Phrygia came under the power of the Roman people.  4.  Having
contended with Rhodes and the peoples of the islands, at first extremely hostile, we afterward
began to employ these same as most trustworthy assistants.  Thus, at first, Rhodes and the islands
were conducting affairs independently; afterward, when the Romans kindly invited them, they
attained to the status of dependent and, under <em>Princeps</em> Vespasian, the province of the Islands was
created.       </span></p>

<p><span face="Times">XI.  The proconsul Servilius, who had been dispatched to a pirate war, obtained Pamphylia, Lycia,
and Pisidia.  Bithynia <strong>[7]</strong> we attained through the will of the late King Nicomedes.  2. 
Gallograecia -- that is Galatia (and indeed, as the name echoes, "Galatians" is from "Gauls") -- we
invaded because it had supplied aid to Antiochus against the Romans.  Mummius, a proconsul,
pursued the Galatians and, when some of them fled toward Olympus, some toward Mount
Magaba (which now is called Modiacus), forced them from the heights to the plains, and, after
they had been conquered, reduced them to perpetual peace.  Afterward, Deiotarus the Tetrarch
controlled Galatia with our permission.  In the end, under Octavian Caesar Augustus, Galatia was
reduced to the status of a province and Lollius, a propraetor, first administered her.  3.  The
Cappadocians first sought our partnership under King Epafrax, and, afterward, Ariobarzanes,
King of Cappadocia, who had been expelled by Mithridates, was restored by Roman arms.  The
Cappadocians always were among our assistants and so nurtured the Roman majesty that Mazaca,
the greatest city in Cappadocia, was named Caesarea in honor of Caesar Augustus.  Ultimately,
under <em>Imperator</em> Claudius Caesar, when Archelaus, King of the Cappadocians, had come to Rome
and, having been detained there a long while, gone to his rest, Cappadocia changed to the status
of a province.  4.  Pontus, after Mithridates, King of Pontus, had been conquered by Pompey,
received the form of a province.  King Palamenes, a friend of the Roman people, controlled
Paphlagonia.  Having often been driven thence from his kingdom, he was restored by us and, with
his death, the legal status of a province was imposed on Paphlagonia.</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">  XII.  In what manner Roman control spread beyond the heights of Mount Taurus will be
demonstrated through a consecutive arrangement of locations rather than of times.  2.  Antiochus,
the most powerful king of Syria, waged a formidable war on the Roman people.  He had 300,000
armed men, and also drew up a battle line of scythed chariots and elephants.  After he had been
conquered in Asia at Magnesia by the consul Scipio, brother of Scipio Africanus, when a peace
had been agreed upon, he was allowed to reign beyond the Taurus.  His sons retained the rule of
Syria under the patronage of the Roman people.  When these had died, we acquired the provinces
of the Syrias.  3.  Servilius, a proconsul, having been dispatched to a bandit war, subjugated he
Cilicians and the Isaurians, who had allied themselves with pirates and seagoing marauders, and
first established a road through Mount Taurus; and he celebrated a triumph over the Cilicians and
Isuarians and thus received the cognomen "Isauricus."</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">XIII.  Cyprus, renowned for riches, seduced the poverty of the Roman people <strong>[8]</strong> in order to be
occupied.  A federate king was ruling her, but so great was the poverty of Roman finances and so
immense the report of the wealth of Cyprus that, after a law had been issued, Cyprus was ordered
confiscated.  When this announcement had been received, the Cyprian king took poison in order
to forfeit his life before his riches.  Cato transported the Cyprian wealth to Rome by means of
ships.  Thus, more avariciously than justly, did we attain jurisdiction of the island.  2.  Cyrene,
together with the other cities of Lydia's Pentapolis, were obtained through the liberality of an
older Ptolemy.  We acquired Libya after the mastery of King Appion had been suppressed.  3.  All
Egypt had been subject to friendly kings, but, when Cleopatra, together with Antony, had been
conquered, in the times of Octavian Caesar Augustus she took the form of a province and first
among the Alexandrians Cornelius Gallus, a Roman judge, took charge. </span></p>

<p><span face="Times">XIV.  Through the confines of Armenia, under Lucius Lucullus, Roman arms were first sent
across the Taurus.  The Phylarchs of the Saracens, after they had been defeated, withdrew to
Osrhoene.  In Mesopotamia, Nisibis was captured by the same Lucullus.  2.  Afterward, through
Pompey, these same locations were obtained by arms.  Syria and Phoenicia were received in a war
with Tigranes, King of the Armenians.  Arabs and Judaeans were conquered in Palestine.  3.  In
the end, under the <em>Princeps</em> Trajan the crown of the King of Armenia Major was offered, and
through Trajan Armenia, Mesopotamia, Assyria, and Arabia were made provinces and an eastern
frontier was established above the banks of the Tigris.  4.  But Hadrian, who succeeded Trajan,
envying Trajan's glory, returned Armenia, Mesopotamia, and Assyria of his own volition and
wanted the Euphrates to be a median between Persians and Romans.  5.  But afterward, under the
two Antonines, Marcus and Verus, and under Severus, Pertinax, and other Roman <em>principes </em>who
battled against the Parthians with varied result, Mesopotamia was four times lost and four times
regained.  6.  In the times of Diocletian, after the Romans had been defeated in an initial
encounter, when, however, King Narses, had been overcome in a second engagement and his wife
and daughters had been captured and cared for with the utmost concern for their chastity, when
peace had been made, Mesopotamia was restored and the frontier above the banks of the Tigris
was reformed, so that we attained sway over five peoples settled beyond the Tigris.  The terms of
this treaty, having been preserved, endured to the time of the Divine Constantine.</span></p>

<p><span face="Times"><b>[9]</b>XV.  Now I know, Renowned <em>Princeps</em>, where your intent is heading.  You assuredly seek to
know how often the arms of Babylonia and Rome were joined and in what places spears
contended with arrows.  The outcomes of wars I shall briefly enumerate.  In a few, you will
discover the enemy, as a result of stealth, to have rejoiced; however, you will judge the Romans
always to have been revealed victors as a result of genuine courage.  2.  First, Arsaces, King of the
Parthians, after a delegation had been dispatched, asked and obtained from Lucius Sylla the good
offices of the Roman people.  3.  Lucius Lucullus pursued to Armenia Mithridates, who had been
deprived of the rule of Pontus.  The same man, with 18,000 Romans, conquered Tigranes, the
Armenians' king, with 7,000 armored horsemen and 2,000 archers.  He subdued Tigranocerta, the
greatest city of Armenia.  He obtained Madaena, a rich region of Armenia, he descended through
Melitene to Mesopotamia, and took Nisibis, along with the king's brother.  After he had prepared
to march against Persia, he accepted a successor.</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">XVI.  Cn. Pompey, of proven good fortune, after he had been dispatched to a Mithridatic War,
having attacked Mithridates in Armenia Minor, prevailed in a night battle and, when forty-two
thousand of the enemy had been killed, he occupied his camp.  Mithridates, with his wife and two
companions, fled to the Bosphorus and when, in desperation of his affairs, he drank poison, and
when the poison.s strength did not prove sufficient, he commanded that he be run through with a
sword by one of his own soldiers.  2.  Pompey pursued Tigranes, King of the Armenians,
Mithridates' supporter; the latter, after the crown had been offered, gave himself up near Artaxata. 
By him were received Mesopotamia, Syria, and a considerable part of Phoenicia; and he also was
allowed to reign within Armenia Major.  3.  Likewise, Pompey imposed a king, Aristarchus, on
the Bosphorians and Colchians; fought with the Albani; granted peace to Orhodes, King of the
Albani, after he had thrice been defeated; received in surrender Hiberia, with King Atrax; and
defeated Saracens and Arabs.  After Judea had been captured, he obtained Jerusalem and made a
treaty with the Persians.  4.  Returning to Antioch, he, delighted <strong>[10]</strong> by the loveliness of the place
and its abundance of waters, consecrated the grove belonging to Daphne, with a wood added on.</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">XVII.  Marcus Crassus, a consul, was dispatched against rebelling Parthians.  He, when he was
asked for peace by a legation dispatched from Persia, said that he would respond at Ctesiphon. 
He crossed the Euphrates at Zeugma, and, having been guided by a deserter, a certain Mazzarus,
descended into an remote wilderness of plains.  2.  There the army was surrounded by formations
of archers flying around them from all sides, with Silas and Surenas, the King's prefects, and was
overwhelmed by the impact of the missles.  Crassus himself -- when, after he had been enticed to a
parlay, he was nearly captured alive -- had escaped while his tribunes resisted, and, seeking flight,
was killed.  </span>3.  His severed head, with his right hand, were borne to the king and then maintained for sport, so
that molten gold might be poured into his throat: to wit, in order that he who, burning with lust
for plunder, after he had been asked by the king to grant peace, had declined, flames of gold might
consume his remains even after he perished.  4.  Lucius Cassius, Crassus' quaestor, a vigorous
man, gathered the remains of the scattered army.  Against the Persians, who were rushing toward
Syria, he thrice contended in most admirable fashion and, after they had been repelled across the
Euphrates, he ravaged them.</p>

<p><span face="Times">XVIII.  The Parthians, with Labienus, who had been of the Pompeian faction and, having been
defeated, had fled to Persia, commander, rushed toward Syria and occupied the whole province. 
2.  On Mount Caper, P. Ventidius Bassus, with a few men, engaged  the Parthians who had
invaded Syria with Labenius in command, escaped, killed Labienus, and, pursuing the Persians,
cast them into utter destruction.  In this engagement, he killed Pacorus, the king's son, on the
same day on which Crassus had been defeated, lest the death of a Roman commander ever be left
unavenged.  3.  Ventidius first celebrated a triumph over the Persians.  M. Antony, having invaded
Media, which now is called Madena, waged war against the Parthians and defeated them in initial
battles.  Afterward, after two legions had been lost, when he was being overwhelmed with famine,
pestilence, and tempests, he barely withdrew the army through Armenia, with the Persians in
pursuit, shocked with so much terror as a result of how times had changed that he contemplated
being run through by one of his own gladiators, lest he come alive in the enemies' power.</span></p>

<p><span face="Times"><strong>[11]</strong>  XIX.  Under Octavian Caesar Augustus, Armenia conspired with Parthia.  2.  Claudius
Caesar, grandson of Augustus, when he been dispatched to <em>Oriens</em> with an army, when he had
settled everything for the benefit of the majesty of the Roman name, and the Armenians, who,
with the Parthians, were then the stronger at the time, had surrendered themselves to him,
Claudius Caesar appointed to the aforementioned peoples judges on the basis of Pompey's
settlement.  3.  A certain Donnes, whom Arsaces had put in command of the Parthians, through an
orchestrated treachery, offered a book in which treasures were contained, inscribed.  While the
Roman <em>imperator </em>was reading very intently, having attacked with a knife, he wounded Claudius. 
The assassin was indeed killed by soldiers.  Claudius, after he had returned to Syria, died from the
wound.  4.  The Persians, for satisfaction of such an outrage, having been granted an audience,
then first gave hostages to Octavian Caesar Augustus and returned the standards taken under
Crassus.  When the peoples of <em>Oriens</em> had been pacified, Augustus Caesar also first received a
legation of Indians.</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">XX.  Nero, the vilest <em>imperator</em> the Roman state has endured, lost Armenia.  Then two Roman
legions, having been sent under the yoke by the Persians, defiled with the utmost infamy the
military oaths of the Roman army.  2.  Trajan, who, after Augustus, set in motion the muscle of
the Roman state, regained Armenia from the Parthians, and, after the crown had been offered,
abolished the kingdom of Armenia Major.  He gave a king to the Albani; received Hiberians,
Bosphorians, and Colchians into the protection of Roman sway; occupied localities of the
Oshroenians and Arabs; obtained the Carduenians and Marcomedians; received and maintained
Anthemusia -- Persia's finest region -- , Seleucia, Ctesiphon, and Babylon; and, after Alexander,
even reached the ends of India.  He established a fleet in the Red Sea.  He made provinces
Armenia, Assyria, and Mesopotamia, which, situated between the Tigris and Euphrates, is made
equal to Egypt in fecundity by the flooding rivers.  <strong>[12]</strong> 3.  It is certain that Hadrian envied
Trajanís glory.  His successor in <em>imperium</em>, after the armies had been recalled, he surrendered
Armenia, Mesopotamia, and Assyria on his own initiative and willed that the Euphrates be a
median between Romans and Persians.</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">XXI.  Two Antonines, Marcus and Verus, that is, father-in-law and son-in-law, simultaneously
Augusti, first held the <em>imperium</em> of the world with an equivalent power.  But of them, Antoninus
the Younger, having set out on a Parthian campaign, felicitously accomplished many and
momentous things against the Persians.  He took Seleucia, a city in Assyria, together with 40,000
of the enemy, and with immense glory he celebrated a triumph over the Persians.  2.  Severus, by
birth African, was a most active <em>imperator</em>.  He quickly conquered the Parthians, annihilated the
Aziabeni, gained control the Arabs of the interior, and made a province in Arabia.  Titles were
obtained by this man for these victories: for he was given the titles "Aziabenicus," "Parthicus," and
"Arabicus."  3.  Antoninus, with the cognomen Caracalla, son of <em>Imperator</em> Severus, preparing an
expedition against the Persians, died a fitting death at Osrhoene, near Edessa, and was buried in
the same spot.  </span></p>

<p><span face="Times">XXII.  Aurelius Alexander, born as if by some destiny for the destruction of the Persian race, took
the helm of the Roman <em>imperium</em> while still a youth.  He gloriously conquered Xerxes, noblest
king of the Persians.  He had Ulpian, the jurisconsult, as Master of the Secretariat.  At Rome, he
celebrated with remarkable pomp a triumph over the Persians.  2.  Under Gordian, a <em>princeps</em>
active through the assurance of youth, the rebelling Parthians were beaten in great battles. 
Returning from Persia a victor, he was killed by the treachery of Philip, who was his Praetorian
Prefect.  Twenty miles from Circensium the troops built for him a tumulus, which now exists, and
they escorted his remains to Rome with the greatest deference of respect.      </span></p>

<p><span face="Times">XXIII.  It is disgusting to report the fate of the unfortunate <em>princeps</em> Valerian.  After the army had
made Valerian <strong>[13]</strong> <em>Imperator</em>, and the Senate Gallienus, Valerian, having contended against the
Persians in Mesopotamia, was defeated by Sapor, King of the Persians, and, having been captured,
wasted away in shameful servitude.  2.  Under Gallienus, when Mesopotamia had been invaded,
the Persians would have begun to claim Syria for themselves, except that -ñ it is shameful to relate -- Odenathus, a Palmyrene decurion, by means of a conscripted force of Syrian peasants, had
resisted sharply and, after the Perisans had several times been scattered, not only defended our
border but also -- what is astonishing to say -- had, avenger of Roman <em>imperium</em>, penetrated to
Ctesiphon.</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">XXIV.  Zenobia, Odenathus' wife, added to the glory of <em>Imperator</em> Aurelian.  For, after her
husbandís death, she was holding the <em>imperium</em> of <em>Oriens</em> by means of a feminine sway.  Aurelian
defeated her, relying on many thousands of armored horsemen and archers, at Immae, not far from
Antioch, and led her captive before his chariot in a triumph at Rome.  2.  <em>Imperator</em> Carus' victory
over the Persians seemed too mighty to the Celestial Divinity.  For it must be believed to have led
to the jealousy of heavenly indignation.  For, after he had entered Persia, he devastated it as if no
one opposed him and took Coche and Ctesiphon, the noblest cities of the Persians.  While, victor
over the entire race, he was occupying an encampment beyond the Tigris, he died, having been
struck by a bolt of lightning.  </span></p>

<p><span face="Times">XXV.  Under <em>Princeps</em> Diocletian, there was observed a procession of victory over the Persians. 
Maximianus Caesar, who had been repulsed in an initial engagement, when he had battled fiercely
with a few men against a countless multitude, withdrew and was received with such great disdain
by Diocletian that, garbed in purple, he ran several miles before his chariot.  2.  And when he had
with difficulty gained that, after his army had been revived from the frontier troops of Dacia, he
might seek a resolution on the battlefield, in Armenia Major, he himself, with two horsemen,
reconnoitered against the enemy and, having fallen suddenly with twenty-five thousand soldiers
upon the enemy encampments, after he had attacked countless formations of Persians, he utterly
annihilated them.  3.  The King of the Persians, Narses, fled; his wife and daughters were captured
and kept with the utmost concern for their chastity.  In admiration for this, the Persians admitted
that the Romans were superior not only in arms but also in behavior.  They returned
Mesopotamia, along with the Transtigritanian regions.  The peace made endured to the benefit of
the state to our own memory.</span></p>

<p><span face="Times"><strong>[14]</strong>  XXVI.  In the final portion of his life, Constantine, master of affairs, prepared an expedition
against Persia.  For, more glorious since the races throughout the world had been pacified and the
recent victory over the Goths, he was descending on Persia with all his formations.  2.  During his
approach, the court at Babylonia was so frightened that a supplicant delegation of Persians
hastened to him and promised that they would obey his commands, but, in return for the constant
raids which they had attempted throughout <em>Oriens</em> under Constantius Caesar, did not gain a
pardon.</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">XXVII.  Constantius fought against the Persians with uneven and more troublesome result.  In
addition to minor encounters of sentries on the border, an engagement to a harsher Mars was
fought nine times, seven times through his commanders, he himself present twice.  2.  To be sure,
at the battles of Sisara, Singara, and Singara again with Constantius present, and of Sicgara and
also Constantina, and, when Amida was captured, the state received a serious wound while he was
<em>princeps</em>.  Moreover, Nisibis was thrice besieged by the Persians, but, while involved in the siege,
the enemy incurred its own, greater loss.  3.  Moreover, at Narasara, where Narses was killed, we
departed winners.  Indeed, in a night battle at Eleia, near Singara, where Constantius was present,
the outcome of all the campaigns would have been offset if the <em>imperator</em> himself, in adverse
locations and at night, had not been able, by addressing them, to recall the soldiers, who had been
aroused to fury, from the inopportune timing of the battle.  Nevertheless, unconquered in strength
-- an unforeseen reserve against a shortage of water -- , when evening was now falling, after they
had attacked the encampment of the Persians and, when the wall had been breached, occupied it,
and, after the king had fled, when, recovering from battle, with torches held before them, they
gazed with eagerness on the water that had been obtained, they were buried by a cloud of arrows,
since they themselves thoughtlessly supplied flaming torches to direct the hits more accurately
through the night toward themselves. </span></p>

<p><span face="Times">XXVIII.  To <em>Princeps</em> Julian, of proven good fortune against external enemies, due measure
against Persia was lacking.  For he, with immense provision, in as much as he was sovereign of the
entire world, set hostile standards against the Parthians, and sailed through the Euphrates a fleet
furnished with supplies.  Relentless in his advance, he either took control of many of the Persians'
cities and bases which had surrendered or took them by force.  2.  When he had made camp
opposite Ctesiphon on the banks of the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates and was holding
daily competitions <strong>[15]</strong> in order to reduce the enemy's attentiveness, in the middle of the night he
rapidly transferred to the opposite bank soldiers who had been loaded on ships.  These,
distinguishing themselves through hardships which would have been difficult to surmount even in
daylight and with no opposition, threw the Persians into confusion by means of unexpected fright
and, when the units of the entire race had been turned about, the victorious soldiery would have
entered the open gates of Ctesiphon, if the opportunity for plunder had not been greater than the
concern for victory.  3.  Having obtained such great glory, when he was warned by his staff
concerning his return, he gave his own plan more credence and, after the ships had been burnt,
when, having been led on a route toward Madenea by a deserter who had delivered himself for the
purpose of deceiving him, he pursued shortcuts, again traversing a route along the right bank of
the Tigris, with his soldiers' flank exposed, when he wandered too incautiously through the
formations and when his own men's sight had been snatched away as a result dust that had been
stirred up, he was wounded, pierced through the abdomen near the groin with a lance by a
cavalryman of the enemy who had encountered him.  Amidst an effusion of much blood, after he,
though injured, had restored the ranks of his men, having said many things to his friends, he
breathed out his lingering soul.  </span></p>

<p><span face="Times">XXIX.  Jovian received an army superior in battles but confused by the sudden death of the
departed <em>imperator</em>.  When supplies were deficient and a very long road loomed ahead on the
return, the Persians, by swift assaults now from the front, now from the rear, and also attacking
the flanks of the middle, delayed the march of the formation.  After several days had been
consumed, so great was the reverence of the Roman name that a discussion about peace was held
first by the Persians, and the army, weakened by famine, was allowed to be withdrawn, after --
what had never happened before -- conditions inimical to the Roman state had been imposed, with
the result that Nisibis and part of Mesopotamia was surrendered, things in which, unskilled in
<em>imperium</em>, Jovian, more desirous of rule than of glory, acquiesced,      </span></p>

<p><span face="Times">XXX.  How much, in turn, must your deeds, Invincible <em>Princeps</em>, be broadcast with a lofty voice. 
I, though unequal to the task of speaking and rather burdened by age, shall ready myself for these
matters.  May the felicity now vouchsafed by God's command and granted by the friendly Divinity
in which you trust and by which you are trusted endure, so that for you the palm of a peace of
Babylonia, too, may accrue to this momentous one concerning the Goths.</span></p>
