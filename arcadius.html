</p><h3>  Introduction and Early Life</h3>
<p>The ineffectual life and reign of Flavius Arcadius are of considerably less
  importance than the quite significant developments that occurred during his reign.  Born
  either in 377 or 378 to then general <a href="theo1.html"><b>Theodosius</b></a> and Aelia Flavia Flacilla, he and his
  younger brother, <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius</b></a>, ruled the eastern and western halves of the Roman Empire
  respectively from 395.  </p>
      <p> Shortly after his birth, his father was raised to the imperial purple in 379.  Events in
  Illyricum with the massive influx of Ostrogothic and Visigothic peoples had resulted in the
  defeat of the Roman army and the death of the emperor, <a href="valens.html"><b>Valens</b></a>.  <a href="theo1.html"><b>Theodosius'</b></a> first task
  was to confront the Visigoths who had been ravaging the Balkans.  Perhaps in the wake of
  this difficult and almost insurmountable task, the emperor wanted to insure that his infant
  son would bear some legitimacy should he die on campaign.  Whatever the reason,
  Arcadius was proclaimed Augustus in January of 383 at the age of five or six.  In the
  following year, his younger brother was born and it seems as if <a href="theo1.html"><b>Theodosius</b></a> initially had
  been interested in preserving the theoretical position of his elder son.  While Arcadius
  enjoyed the status of Augustus, <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius</b></a> only achieved the office of consul posterior in
  386.  Perhaps the eastern emperor had wanted to avoid the possible conflicts that arose
  earlier in the century with the family of <a href="conniei.html"><b>Constantine</b></a>.  Recent events in the west with the
  assassination of <a href="gratian.html"><b>Gratian</b></a> by <a href="madmax.html"><b>Magnus Maximus</b></a> may have also played a part:  Theodosius
  initially had to leave the murder of his imperial colleague unavenged and leave the boy-
  emperor,<a href="valenii.html"><b> Valentinian II</b></a>, largely undefended.  The profusion of emperors may well have
  been seen by <a href="theo1.html"><b>Theodosius</b></a> as kindling for civil war.  His own autocratic tendencies may
  have also meant that he saw only one possible successor for himself.</p>
       <p>Nevertheless, <a href="theo1.html"><b>Theodosius</b></a> gave Arcadius very little independence in early life. 
  When he went to campaign against <a href="madmax.html"><b>Magnus</b></a> in the late 380's, he placed his son under the
  Praetorian Prefect of the East, Tatian, who was the <i>de facto </i>emperor in <a href="theo1.html"><b>Theodosius'</b></a>
  absence.  This began a long series of regencies for Arcadius.  The strength of Tatian's
  position with the eastern governing class made the office of Praetorian Prefect all the more
  powerful in Constantinople, which in turn made it easier to dominate future emperors. 
  When <a href="theo1.html"><b>Theodosius</b></a> replaced Tatian with the more malleable and more ambitious Rufinus in
  392, he had appointed a minister who would centralize even greater authority under the
  prefecture.</p>
     <p>  By 393, the emperor's situation had changed radically.  When events in the west
  demanded his attention again, <a href="theo1.html"><b>Theodosius</b></a> was in a much stronger position.  The
  ascendancy of the general, Arbogast, and his own puppet emperor, <a href="eugene.html"><b>Eugenius</b></a>, in the west
  provided <a href="theo1.html"><b>Theodosius</b></a> an opportunity and, indeed, the obligation to take full control of the
  Empire.  The chance for having his own two sons ruling both halves of Rome not only
  seemed practical and feasible, but such an arrangement would establish himself as the head of a new dynasty. 
  With thoughts in that direction, <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius</b></a> was made Augustus in 393 and accompanied his
  father west in the summer of 394.  Arcadius, although near his majority, was nevertheless
  placed again under the guardianship (<i>epitropos</i>) of the Prefect of the East.  In January of
  395,<a href="theo1.html"><b> Theodosius the Great</b></a> died and his two sons took theoretical control of the two
  halves of the Roman Empire.</p>
  
 <h3> Early Reign and the Dominance of Rufinus and Eutropius (395-399)</h3>
      <p> Arcadius was eighteen when he assumed the throne in the east.  We do not know
  whether or not he was ready for the responsibilities.  During the mid-380's, the young
  emperor had been educated in part by Themistius, a famous pagan statesman, philosopher,
  and speaker.  In what way he affected Arcadius is impossible to say, but surely his
  teachings must have included statecraft.  Perhaps because of this influence, the new
  emperor's attempt to establish himself as an independent force can be seen in a series of
  laws passed at his accession.  In contrast to trying to create a military image for himself,
  which would not be allowed either by Rufinus or by the eastern court, he attempted to
  portray himself as a pious Christian emperor.  He enacted several comprehensive laws
  against heresy and paganism.  </p>
      <p> This was not necessarily an ineffectual strategy.  By celebrating his religious piety,
  he expressed his power in the only way available to an emperor largely controlled by his
  ministers.  He also perhaps sought to gain support and power from the local governing
  and religious hierarchies in Constantinople.  Arcadius also perhaps thought that he was
  carrying on in the tradition of his father and so, by extension, might share in some of his
  glory.  Rufinus in contrast wanted to tie himself to the emperor through a marriage
  connection to his daughter.  But in April of 395, Arcadius had taken advantage of the
  Prefect's temporary absence to marry Aelia Eudoxia, whose guardian, the general,
  Promotus, had been a bitter enemy of Rufinus.  Arcadius had been aided in this move by
  his own grand chamberlain (<i>praepositus sacri cubiculi</i>), Eutropius, and it perhaps
  indicated the degree to which he wanted to be free of any regent.</p>
     <p>  But in reality, Arcadius gained little if any power.  Rufinus assumed full control of
  the east, and the Vandal Stilicho, <a href="theo1.html"><b>Theodosius'</b></a> closest advisor and general, took control of <a href="https://www.salve.edu/~dimaiom/honorius.html"><b>Honorius</b></a> in
  the west.  The tension between east and west quickly grew when Stilicho, in command of
  all the eastern and western armies, tried to press his guardianship over Arcadius as well. 
  Moreover, there was considerable resentment against Rufinus in the east for using his
  office to greatly enrich himself and perhaps, too, because he was a westerner.  Rufinus,
  understanding the perils around him, acted quickly.  He had Arcadius demand the return of
  the eastern armies at once.  Stilicho acquiesced, perhaps because the general was basing
  his claim of guardianship on his own legitimacy:  to have taken control of the east and
  Arcadius by force would have undermined his position there and perhaps in the west.  The
  soldiers returned under the command of the Gothic general, Gainas.  With the control of
  the field army, it seemed as if Rufinus was going to be more thoroughly in control of the
  east and over Arcadius.</p>
       <p>He did not long enjoy his victory.  When Arcadius and Rufinus came to greet the
  armies at Hebdoman near Constantinople in November of 395, the soldiers turned on the
  Praetorian Prefect and cut him down in front of the emperor.  Whether Stilicho instigated
  the assassination is a matter of some debate, but if he did, he received no benefit from it. 
  The armies remained and Arcadius soon fell under the sway of other ministers. 
  Nevertheless, despite the shock and fear Arcadius may have felt at witnessing such a brutal
  murder, he probably missed Rufinus' presence not at all and even thought it might provide
  an opportunity to assert his own authority.  For the bureaucracy, the death meant that
  maintaining civilian control over the army was paramount to their own survival.</p>
       <p>Soon thereafter, Eutropius assumed Rufinus' place in dominating Arcadius.  Since
  the grand chamberlain could control access to the emperor and commanded the powerful
  palace bureaucracy, he was well-placed to dictate what and whom the emperor saw and
  heard.  Military officers--frequently Germanic--who dominated the western government,
  were held suspect by fearful and jealous civil administrators in Constantinople.  Eutropius
  used that fear to his advantage and froze out any access they may have had to the circles
  of power.  His decision to effectively eliminate the military's input in decision-making
  would eventually lead to his demise.</p>
       <p>It is difficult to determine how popular Eutropius was either with Arcadius or with
  the wider population.  As a eunuch and a former slave, the sources generally portray him
  very negatively.  He nevertheless seems to have enjoyed some support from the emperor,
  likely aided by Eudoxia with whom the grand chamberlain had close ties.  The emperor
  happily took annual vacations in Galatia, apparently upon the Eutropius' suggestion.
  Moreover, the chamberlain showed great personal courage and talent in leading a
  campaign against invading Huns in 397/8, for which he won the consulship and the
  rank of patrician in the following year of 399.  He also seems to have gained considerable
  support from the local clergy by procuring the patriarchate of Constantinople in 398 for
  John Chrysostom.  </p>
       <p>Despite Eutropius' rise to power, however, eastern policy changed little.  The
  religious policies of <a href="theo1.html"><b>Theodosius</b></a> and Arcadius continued, including the forced closure of
  pagan temples in Gaza.  More significantly, tension between the two halves of the empire
  persisted as Stilicho continued to press for his position as guardian.  Although Stilicho led
  periodic raids into Greece and Thrace to attack the new Visigothic king, Alaric, his
  victories were incomplete and were more likely meant to keep the Germanic people out of
  western territory.  This meant, among other things, that the Visigoths were an enduring
  problem for the east.  Eutropius in turn supported the revolt of the Count Gildo in Africa,
  which was under western control, in an attempt to destabilize Stilicho's control and further
  eastern domains.</p>
       <p>The failure of the revolt in 398 was the first step in Eutropius' downfall.  The
  decision to exclude the military men of the period, particularly among the growing
  importance of Germanic officers, created a dangerous situation.  By 399, the
  dissatisfaction with east-west affairs and the Gildo fiasco resulted in a revolt by the Gothic
  count, Tribigild.  He was apparently in collusion with Gainas, who had taken advantage of
  the crisis to be named chief general in the east (<i>magister utriusque militiae</i>).  Gainas
  quickly reached an agreement with the rebel and part of the settlement was the dismissal
  of Eutropius, to which Arcadius--at Eudoxia's urging--agreed.  The chamberlain took
  refuge in the Hagia Sophia, and was exiled to Cyprus.  But shortly thereafter, in the autumn of 399, Eutropius
  was recalled, tried and executed in Chalcedon.</p>
  
  <h3>The Age of Eudoxia (400-404)</h3>
       <p>The death of Eutropius precipitated a serious crisis.  Gainas, who had wanted high
  office for years, now tried to force the hand of Arcadius.  Having come to a quick
  resolution with Tribigild, he moved from Thrace towards Constantinople in 400.  With the
  Germanic troops supporting him, Gainas tried for six months to initiate his own primacy--
  including seizing the imperial palace--but which failed.  He was forced to withdraw
  personally  from the city to regroup and planned to use his troops remaining there to seize
  the entire city.  But they were slaughtered by the inhabitiants and he fled first to Thrace
  and then to Asia.  Eventually Gainas was killed by the Huns later in that year.  His
  attempted coup ensured that Germanic officers would never again be trusted by the
  eastern government and would forever be kept out of any important decision-making roles. </p> 
      <p> The likely successor to Eutropius had been the anti-Germanic leader, Aurelianus,
  who had succeeded to the Prefecture of the East in 399.  But Gainas had exiled him,
  having forced Arcadius to hand him over, and although Aurelianus returned triumphantly after
  Gainas' departure, he appears to have lost his hold over the emperor.  In the meantime,
  Aelia Eudoxia had done much to forward her own place in the government.  In January of
  400, she had been named Augusta, a singular distinction offered to only three other
  women in the previous century.  Her position thus gained a semi-official legitimacy
  afforded to very few Roman empresses.  It has been assumed that because of her beauty,
  her intelligence, and her fecundity (she bore Arcadius five children), she was able to assert
  her influence to a point where she was the new power behind the throne.</p>
      <p> That assessment, while held by many scholars, is not entirely accurate.  While there
  were several events in which she played a crucial part, they were not terribly important
  moments during Arcadius' reign.  But because Eudoxia was enormously wealthy, because
  she delivered a male heir in 401, and because she was involved in a highly publicized and
  drawn out political fight with John Chrysostom, this belief that there was an assumption of
  power is based more on the notoriety of her acts than on actual control.  The fact that
  there was no one clearly dominating the government nor the emperor during this time
  implies perhaps that Arcadius had more power during these five years of his reign than at
  any other time.  </p>
     <p>  There are several indications that he did try to improve and assert his own
  position.  The emperor and his court immediately came to some understanding with the
  west.  The east at the very least gave <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius</b></a> and Stilicho moral support in their
  increasing problems with Alaric.  In 402, the feeling of goodwill was sealed by a joint
  consulship between Arcadius and his brother.  The emperor also sought to establish his
  own military prowess and Christian piety with the erection of a column set up in the
  Hippodrome of Constantinople in 402/3.  The column depicted his military victory over
  Gainas, crowned with a capital emblazoned with the Greek letters chi-rho, symbolizing his
  devotion to Christ.  Arcadius' son, <a href="theo2.html"><b>Theodosius II</b></a>, was born in 401, and was quickly made
  Augustus at the age of eight months.  The eastern ruler was thus interested in assuring his
  own dynasty.</p>
      <p> In all these things, the emperor was largely successful, but they were largely
  overshadowed by the feud between his empress and the bishop of Constantinople. 
  Eudoxia had already shown herself able in pushing her interests during the baptism of her
  son.  The Bishop of Constantinople, however, was a much tougher opponent than her
  husband.  John Chrysostom, a strong believer in social justice, had boorishly attacked
  Eudoxia and many of her friends for the conspicuous luxury in which they lived and
  displayed themselves.  At the height of these attacks, John compared the empress to
  Jezebel.  Eudoxia in turn used her considerable influence to inflame hostility among the
  clergy against the bishop.  Working through Bishop Theophilus of Alexandria, in 403
  Chrysostom was deposed and forced into exile at a Church council convened by the
  emperor (the Synod of the Oak at Chalcedon).  However, there was soon such turmoil and uproar in the
  imperial city that the bishop was recalled a few days later.  But the public feuding between
  Eudoxia and Chrysostom continued until at last she had him banished again in 404, this
  time permanently.  Among other things, it caused a breach between Arcadius and his
  brother, who had, with Pope Innocent I, tried to support Chrysostom.</p>
      <p> Eudoxia's victory was short-lived, however.  In October of 404, the Augusta died
  of a miscarriage.  Her death was seen by some as retribution for dismissing John. 
  Whatever the reason, her end also signaled a complete retreat into the background by the
  emperor and no further initiatives seem to have been pushed by the 27-year-old Augustus.</p>
  
 <h3> The Final Years:  Anthemius and Death (404-408)</h3>
       <p>The last years of Arcadius' reign were completely dominated by his Praetorian
  Prefect of the East, Anthemius.  It was perhaps fitting that when the emperor seems to
  have been most retiring, the most able and energetic of his high ministers came to power. 
  Anthemius worked hard to solve a series of governmental abuses, continue to push for
  Christianization, and secure the east from attack.</p>
      <p> Anthemius first seems to have tried to reconcile with the west, so much so that
  there was a joint consulship between Anthemius and Stilicho in 405.  This might have also
  been meant to symbolize the Prefect's new dominance, however.  Additionally, a number
  of new laws were passed, curtailing paganism, Judaism and heresy.  He tried to make use
  of the continuing problem of incoming Germanic peoples to combat the Isaurian tribes
  which had been plaguing Asia Minor since 403.  While it failed to halt either group's
  incursions, it was nevertheless a practical and intelligent strategy.  As a means of
  protecting the imperial capital, Anthemius also strengthened the walls around
  Constantinople.  Our records for the last years of Arcadius' rule are quite spotty, but the
  emperor himself seems to have completely vanished, even symbolically, from the political
  scene.</p>
       <p>In May of 408, Flavius Arcadius died at the age of 31 of unknown causes.  Our
  only physical description of Arcadius is heavily influenced by the generally low regard in
  which he was held.  The emperor was supposedly short, thin and dark-complected.  A
  more kindly correspondent described him as good-natured and temperate.  His son
  succeeded him without  any controversy and the government remained unchanged. 
  Arcadius thus left the world much as he entered it:  without much significance and
  overshadowed by more powerful forces.</p>
  
  <h3>Assessment</h3>
      <p> Despite the ineffectual nature of Arcadius and his rule, a number of significant
  changes occurred during his stewardship of the eastern empire.  His inability to forcefully
  or at least effectively govern meant that there were few consistent or long-range goals of
  his administration.  With the exception of trying to emphasize the emperor's piety, an
  important development in the history of the Byzantine monarchy, Arcadius and his
  ministers were for the most part simply reacting to events.</p>
       <p>The emperor became an even more remote figure to the general public.  Even in
  the capital city itself, he was rarely seen:  we read in one account that people came running
  to see the emperor for the first time when he happened to be praying in a local church.  A
  series of "orientalizing" court practices no doubt continued in order to emphasize the
  symbolic separation of the emperor from the rest of society.  The hieratic, almost semi-
  divine nature of the imperial person, also became a feature of the eastern ruler.</p>
     <p>
Perhaps of greatest importance was the political and cultural split
between east and west.  With the death of Theodosius, the two halves of
the Roman Empire increasingly  went their separate ways.  For the most
part, the west was thrown back upon its own resources, unable to deal with
the problems of the fifth century.  The east proved more compact and more
resilient:  it largely weathered the political storms from without and
within.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Constantinople fully became the imperial capital of the east, a <i>Roma
  nova.</i>  The emperor rarely left the city and the palace officials became more influential
  than many of the more theoretically important ministers outside the city.  Constantinople
  was also made an archepiscopate and Chrysostom and others started to push strongly for
  its primacy in the east.  Both public and private building projects beautified and enlarged
  the city.  Under Arcadius' reign, it truly became the second city of the Roman Empire.</p>
       <p>Finally, the hard stance against Germanic officers in Roman government became a
  central feature in the east.  While the reasons for this development were inspired largely
  out of fear and perhaps racism, the eastern Roman Empire did manage to avoid the largely
  detrimental succession of Germanic generalissimos who controlled the west in the fifth
  century.  It also encouraged the eastern rulers in the following century to take hard lines
  against other peoples, including the Isaurians, the Huns and the Persians.  Taken in all, the era of Arcadius was far more important than Arcadius himself. 
  He perhaps had his father's pretensions, but none of the skills or powers necessary to leave
  his mark on the Empire.</p>
  
  <h3>Sources and Bibliography</h3>
       <p>There are a number of sources that treat the age of Arcadius.  The historians
  Zosimus (<i>New History</i>), Socrates (<i>Ecclesiastical History</i>) and Sozomon (<i>Ecclesiastical
  History</i>) offer the most complete accounts.  Additionally, Bishop Synesius of Cyrene in
  letters and other works (<i>On the Kingship</i> and <i>On Providence</i>) specifically addresses a
  number of the problems and issues going on in Constantinople and the imperial court at
  that time.  The letters and homilies of John Chrysostom are also of enormous value and
  tell us more about the social history of the capital than any other source.  Minor accounts
  include the <i>Chronicon Paschale</i> and the <i>Chronicle of Marcellinus Comes</i>.  Several
  important saints' lives, including the <i>Life of Porphyry</i>, provide valuable information about
  events outside the capital.  Finally, for the military and political organization of the Roman
  Empire, the <i>Notitia Dignitatum</i> offers a static look at the early fifth century.
