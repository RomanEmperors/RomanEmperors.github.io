<b>Theophano, wife of Romanus II and Nicephorus II Phocas</b></h3></center>

</p><p><b>Introduction</b></p></center>

<p>Theophano, wife first of<b><a href="romeii.html"> Romanus II</a></b>
(959-963) and then of <b><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus II Phocas </a></b>(963-969),
is noted among Byzantine empresses for having been the only empress generally
believed to have been guilty of her husband's murder (though there is also
a good case for believing that her granddaughter <b><a href="zoep.html">Zoe</a></b>
may also have orchestrated the death of <i>her</i> first husband <b><a href="romanusii.html">Romanus
III Argyrus</a></b>). Theophano may not have been as black as she was painted:
at least, her conspiracy against <b><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus</a></b>
had the possible merit of protecting the interests of her two sons, the
rightful emperors. As regent, Theophano obviously felt justified in taking
an interest in government and from the gripping incidents which enlivened
her career we have evidence for the fact that empresses could take a practical
part in interfering with the succession to the throne, and that the women's
quarters (<i>gynaeconitis</i>) of the palace could be a centre of intrigue
and alternative government.
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times">The rise to the purple</span></b></p></center>

<p>Originally born under the rather plebeian name of Anastaso, a diminutive
of Anastasia, Theophano was renamed on her rise to the purple to reflect
a more cultured background (Theophan√≥ means 'vision of God' or 'divinely
shining' and is a diminutive of the name Theophania; one of the daughters
of <b><a href="connieviip.html">Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus</a></b>
had also been called Theophano). She was lucky enough in her teens to be
selected to marry <b><a href="romeii.html">Romanus II</a></b>, the only
son and youngest child of <b><a href="connieviip.html">Constantine VII</a></b>,
who had finally been born in 939 in the wake of five sisters (<b><a href="zoep.html">Zoe</a></b>,
Anna, Agatha, Theophano and <b><a href="theodorap.html">Theodora</a></b>).<b><a href="#N_1_">[[1]]</a></b>
As heir to the throne, he had, of course, already been provided with a
suitable royal bride. The six-year-old princess Bertha, daughter of Hugh
of Provence, king of Italy (927-947), had been brought to Constantinople
in 944, renamed Eudocia, and educated towards her imperial role. Once provided
with a suitable bride, <b><a href="romeii.html">Romanus</a></b> was crowned
co-emperor on 6 April 945, but, unhappily, Bertha had died in 949 before
the marriage could be consummated.<b><a href="#N_2_">[[2]]</a></b> So another
marriage was arranged, this time with Hedwig of Bavaria, daughter of Henry
of Bavaria, the brother of Otto I the Great, who was first king (936-962)
and then emperor (962-973) of Germany. The aim of this alliance was to
unite Germany and Byzantium against the Hungarians, who had fairly recently
settled in the Danube basin. A eunuch was sent to teach Hedwig Greek, but
she was unhappy at the thought of this marriage and in 954 married Burchard
II of Swabia.<b><a href="#N_3_">[[3]]</a></b> Along with the eunuch, a
portrait painter had been sent to make a lifelike depiction of the bride-designate
to send back to Constantinople, but this did not eventuate: the young girl
detested the idea of marrying a Greek, and made faces until the project
was abandoned. In the event, the Hungarians were decisively defeated by
Otto in 955.<b><a href="#N_4_">[[4]]</a></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">Perhaps the court and imperial family had had enough
of these frustrating attempts to find a suitable western bride. Perhaps
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romeii.html">Romanus</a></span></b><span face="Times">,
at the age of seventeen, took matters into his own hands. He was to marry
a wife from a very different background, the marriage probably taking place
in 955. Theophano was an exceptionally beautiful girl, born in Constantinople,
apparently without aristocratic connections (though this scenario seems
highly unlikely). The contemporary source Leo the Deacon and the historian
Scylitzes agree that she was of obscure parentage: in fact Scylitzes maintains
that her father was an innkeeper.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_5_">[[5]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
However, Scylitzes was hostile to Theophano, and may well have been exaggerating
the obscurity of her birth in an attempt to denigrate her background. It
is, of course, marginally possible that her evident attractions were thought
to counterbalance her lack of noble origins. Leo tells us that she was
more beautiful than any other woman of her time and, while she may have
captured the fancy of the young co-emperor, beauty was always considered
a prerequisite for an imperial bride, even to the extent of brides for
the heir to the throne being supposedly chosen in a form of beauty-contest
from the late eighth century until the early tenth (though there was generally
a hidden agenda underpinning the final choice).</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_6_">[[6]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Perhaps this was a factor in the choice of Theophano as a potential empress,
but the matter is unresolved, and we have to bear in mind that Theophano
was invariably vilified by Scylitzes, our main source. Marriage and matrimonial
alliances were taken very seriously at the imperial court, and it is highly
unlikely that the teenage heir would have been able to force a decision
on his family.</span>
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times">Imperial training</span></b></p></center>

<p><span face="Times">One advantage of selecting a Constantinopolitan bride
was that Theophano did not need to be taught Greek, but there were many
other areas in which she would have had to have received instruction (quite
apart from the fact that, if she were of lowly origins, her Greek may well
have needed some improvement). The rules and traditions of court ceremonial
were manifold and intricate. While much of the ceremonial was being committed
to writing by the antiquarian </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="connieviip.html">Constantine
VII Porphyrogenitus</a></span></b><span face="Times">, one of the main
duties of the eunuchs and officials of the women's quarters was to pass
on the knowledge of the formal ceremonies which orchestrated every detail
of imperial life from official dinners to receptions of new recruits to
the imperial household. Every detail of order of precedence, costume, venue,
schedule of events, and appropriate gestures, movement and speech had to
be fully mastered by every participant.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_7_">[[7]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
As well as being a fundamental part of mainstream court life, the empress
moreover had her own court with ceremonial which reflected that of the
emperor and his male courtiers.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_8_">[[8]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
She also had to be present at special banquets and at the promotions of
officials and their wives, and gave receptions for the wives of visiting
dignitaries.</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">The teen-age Theophano would have learnt her role
and special duties by observing her mother-in-law </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="helenap.html">Helena
Lecapena</a></span></b><span face="Times">, the senior Augusta. Both empresses
played a vital role in the reception of Olga, princess of Kiev, in the
Great Palace, perhaps in September 957 or 958.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_9_">[[9]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Olga and her entourage were first formally received by</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="connieviip.html">
Constantine VII </a></span></b><span face="Times">and the whole court in
the Magnaura Palace. Following this, in the Triclinium of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="justinia.html">Justinian</a></span></b><span face="Times">,
the empress and co-empress (</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="helenap.html">Helena</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and Theophano) received seven different groups of court wives (the <i>zostae</i>;
the <i>magistrissae</i>; the <i>patriciae</i>; the <i>protospathariae ophicialeae</i>;
the remaining <i>protospathariae</i>; the <i>spatharocandidatissae</i>;
and finally the <i>spathareae</i>, <i>stratorissae</i> and <i>candidatissae</i>).
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="helenap.html">Helena</a></span></b><span face="Times">
as empress sat on Theophilus' great throne, and her daughter-in-law on
a golden chair to the side. Then Olga and her entourage and female attendants
entered and were permitted to converse with the empress. Finally, the emperor,
empress and </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="connieviip.html">Constantine
VII's</a></span></b><span face="Times"> porphyrogenite ('purple-born')
children received Olga in the empress' bedchamber.</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">Later on the same day </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="helenap.html">Helena</a></span></b><span face="Times">
gave a great banquet in the Triclinium of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="justinia.html">Justinian</a></span></b><span face="Times">
for all the female Russians, while the emperor received the males in the
Chrysotriclinium. Olga dined with the empress, who may on this visit have
acted as godmother at Olga's Orthodox baptism (Olga took the name Helena
in honour of the empress).</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_10_">[[10]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Standing with </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="helenap.html">Helena</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and Theophano, Olga then received the prostrations of all the wives of
leading men at the banquet and the wives of court officials. At dinner
Olga was seated at a table with all those court ladies with the rank of
<i>zoste</i>
(implying that Olga had also been granted this specific rank,
<i>zoste
patricia</i>, marked by its own costume and girdle, the '<i>zoste</i>').</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_11_">[[11]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Entertainment at the banquet included choirs of choristers and theatrical
dances by the Blue and Green factions. Dessert was served separately in
the Aristeterion, where Olga sat with the emperors (</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="connieviip.html">Constantine
VII</a></span></b><span face="Times"> and </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romeii.html">Romanus
II</a></span></b><span face="Times">), the children of both emperors, and
Theophano; presumably Theophano's two eldest children were present, starting
to learn some of the tricks of the imperial trade. Olga was then presented
with 500 silver coins in a jewel-encrusted golden bowl, while appropriate
presents were also made to her six relatives and eighteen attendants.</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">On the second occasion on which Olga was received
at court, in the following month, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="helenap.html">Helena</a></span></b><span face="Times">
put on another banquet for Olga, this time in the Pentacubuclium of St
Paul (the emperor again dined with the Russian males in the Chrysotriclinium).
Theophano and all </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="connieviip.html">Constantine's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
children were in attendance again, and more coins were distributed to Olga
and her entourage.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_12_">[[12]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">The details of such ceremonial were overseen by the
master of ceremonies, the atriclines, the courtier in charge of imperial
banquets, who acted as stage-manager and prompted the participants during
the events. Every official and attendant of the bedchamber must also have
been thoroughly instructed in the protocol. Nevertheless, the learning
curve for a new empress must have been vast. As well as the overarching
ceremonial and etiquette which underpinned every moment of their official
life, the new empress had to be aware of the details pertaining to the
reception of foreign officials, promotion of courtiers, attendance at liturgies
and saints' festivals, and distributions to charity. Herrin argues for
the need for intensive education of Byzantine princesses, pointing out
that all these activities required an understanding of the diplomatic,
political, ecclesiastical and philanthropic considerations behind the various
functions. Younger females of the royal family may have received a training
in such matters from the palace eunuchs who preserved and maintained such
traditions.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_13_">[[13]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Becoming a Byzantine empress was certainly not a job for the faint-hearted.</span>

<p><b><span face="Times">Theophano as empress-consort</span></b></p></center>

<p><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="connieviip.html">Constantine
VII Porphyrogenitus</a></span></b><span face="Times"> died on 9 November
959 and was succeeded by his son Romanus. The new emperor mainly followed
in his father's footsteps, retaining some of those who had served his father
well (such as the general Nicephorus Phocas),</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_14_">[[14]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
though the administration was put entirely under the charge of the eunuch
Joseph Bringas, the <i>parakoimomenos</i> (chamberlain), in place of Basil
Lecapenus 'the Nothus' (or illegitimate), son of Romanus I Lecapenus, and
thus Romanus II's own half-uncle.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_15_">[[15]]</a>&nbsp;
<a href="romeii.html">Romanus</a></span></b><span face="Times"> himself
does not seem to have left a great impression in his wake, though of course
his reign was short (less than four years). That he was really weak and
malleable is a view which has possibly resulted from the presumption that
Theophano was incisive and manipulative and thus the more dominant of the
imperial couple. On the whole generalisations are perhaps best avoided.
We should at least note that </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romeii.html">Romanus'</a></span></b><span face="Times">
generals achieved some great successes during his reign, such as the recovery
of Crete from the Arabs under the generalship of</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">
Nicephorus Phocas</a></span></b><span face="Times"> in 961 (</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="connieviip.html">Constantine
VII's </a></span></b><span face="Times">attempt in 949 had failed). </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Phocas</a></span></b><span face="Times">
also achieved great triumphs in Asia Minor, and Aleppo was captured in
December 962.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_16_">[[16]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">If </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romeii.html">Romanus</a></span></b><span face="Times">
was conservative in his approach to power Theophano was less so -- though
it is important to remember that her actions are generally portrayed through
a hostile medium. Working on the assumption that Theophano was ambitious
and unscrupulous, Scylitzes records that she and </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romeii.html">Romanus</a></span></b><span face="Times">
attempted to poison </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="connieviip.html">Constantine
VII</a></span></b><span face="Times"> (the motivation no doubt stemming
from Theophano's desire to be senior empress and wife to the emperor).
The murder attempt was, fortuitously, unsuccessful (we are told) and we
should remember that we are working in a milieu where any illness can be
attributed to 'poison'. Scylitzes further hypothesises that </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="connieviip.html">Constantine's
</a></span></b><span face="Times">actual
death might have been due to a successful second attempt.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_17_">[[17]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
We can say nothing to confirm or deny this, except that there is no evidence.
Indeed, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romeii.html">Romanus</a></span></b><span face="Times">
was hardly twenty at this point, and his antiquarian and encyclopaedist
father was surely not a threat to his future, though he might well might
have had suspicions of his Lecapenus in-laws, legitimate and illegitimate.
Indeed, it does appear that Theophano desired passionately to remove all
rivals, such as her mother and sisters-in-law, from the palace. After </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="connieviip.html">Constantine's
</a></span></b><span face="Times">death
she tried hard to get</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romeii.html">
Romanus</a></span></b><span face="Times"> to remove his mother </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="helenap.html">Helena</a></span></b><span face="Times">
from the imperial court, and </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romeii.html">Romanus</a></span></b><span face="Times">
seems meekly to have concurred. At least, only <b><a href="helenap.html">Helena's</a></b>
lamentations and threat of a mother's curse are said to have saved her
position. So Theophano lost that one. But she did succeed in having </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romeii.html">Romanus'</a></span></b><span face="Times">
five sisters dispatched to convents and tonsured (i.e., they canonically
became nuns), perhaps in 960, the following year. Not merely had they been
banished from court, but their taking the veil meant that any later marriage
was technically out of the question. They do not seem to have gone willingly,
and obviously regretted the luxuries of the palace. By special dispensation
of the patriarch they were allowed to vary the monastic diet and eat meat.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_18_">[[18]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
So, while unable to remove </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="helenap.html">Helena</a></span></b><span face="Times">,
Theophano had outmanoeuvred her by having all five princesses, her daughters,
banished from court, even though the court was used to housing an extended
family network, including numerous superfluous women. </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="helenap.html">Helena's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
remaining life at court must have been uncomfortable and she died not long
afterwards.</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">Perhaps Theophano saw her mother and sister-in-laws
as potential rivals not just in status but in power. Certainly </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="helenap.html">Helena</a></span></b><span face="Times">
had earlier (in December 944) protected her father </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romanusi.html">Romanus
I Lecapenus</a></span></b><span face="Times"> from the ambitions of her
brothers, when he was unwillingly dispatched to a monastery. In addition,
she had certainly encouraged her husband to depose and exile her brothers,
before they could depose him as well. In the very next month (January 945)
they were arrested while at dinner and sent to monasteries themselves.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_19_">[[19]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
During her husband's reign, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="helenap.html">Helena</a></span></b><span face="Times">
seems to have cooperated with the eunuch Basil 'the Illegitimate' ('the
Nothus'), in overseeing the government. Scylitzes, at least, accuses them
of nepotism and appointing inappropriate people to positions for a profit.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_20_">[[20]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
In this context, Theophano perhaps felt that </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="helenap.html">Helena</a></span></b><span face="Times">
might overshadow her own influence at court. But the sisters-in-law can
hardly have been a threat -- although they were not un-educated. Agatha,
at least, had helped out her father with chancellery work when he was ill,
'because she understood the work and was well informed about official government
matters'.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_21_">[[21]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Significantly </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romeii.html">Romanus</a></span></b><span face="Times">
does not seem to have put up any fight at all about his sisters being made
nuns and banished from the palace. Perhaps the birth of the young </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basilii.html">Basil
(II)</a></span></b><span face="Times"> made him concerned about any possible
repercussions on the succession if his sisters were to marry and have children.
But it was not usual for princesses to be discarded in this way, and there
must have been a significant hostile force at work against them.</span>
</p><p><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romeii.html">Romanus'</a></span></b><span face="Times">
death was unexpected. He had reigned for little more than three years and
died at the early age of twenty-four. Officially his death was said to
have taken place while (inappropriately) hunting deer during Lent. However,
another version circulated: Leo the Deacon states that most people had
the suspicion that he was poisoned with hemlock. There was no doubt as
to where the poison originated -- the women's quarters of the palace.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_22_">[[22]]</a></span></b>

<p><b><span face="Times">Theophano as regent</span></b></p></center>

<p><span face="Times">In her eight years of marriage (c. 955-963) Theophano
bore </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romeii.html">Romanus
</a></span></b><span face="Times">four
children, successfully fulfilling her function in providing the Macedonian
dynasty with a new generation. The eldest child seems to have been a girl,
Helena (named after her grandmother), who was old enough to be present
for dessert when Olga was received in the palace. The dates of birth for
the two sons </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basilii.html">Basil
</a></span></b><span face="Times">and
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="connieVIIIp.html">Constantine</a></span></b><span face="Times">
are not precisely known. </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basilii.html">Basil
</a></span></b><span face="Times">was
probably born in 957 or 958, and we know that </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="connieVIIIp.html">Constantine</a></span></b><span face="Times">
was three years younger. The youngest child, Anna, who was later to marry
Vladimir of Kiev, was born only two days before Romanus' death on 15 March
963.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_23_">[[23]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">As </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romeii.html">Romanus</a></span></b><span face="Times">
had made no provision for a regency, the senate and patriarch ensured that
Theophano became regent for her sons </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basillii.html">Basil
</a></span></b><span face="Times">and
<b><a href="connieVIIIp.html">Constantine</a></b>.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_24_">[[24]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Both had been crowned. Bringas was left in charge of the administration,
but Theophano aligned herself with his opponents Basil 'the Nothus' and
the general </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus
Phocas</a></span></b><span face="Times">. </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus</a></span></b><span face="Times">
was declared emperor by his army in Cappadocia on 2 July, where he had
considerable local support, through the machinations of his nephew </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johnItz.html">John
Tzimisces</a></span></b><span face="Times">, also a highly successful general.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_25_">[[25]]</a><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus
</a></span></b><span face="Times">then
marched on the capital, where he was opposed by Bringas at the head of
the administration. He entered the city on 16 August 963: the regency had
lasted exactly five months. It is unlikely that Theophano was unaware of
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus'</a></span></b><span face="Times">
intentions, and his plans appear to have dated back to the beginning of
the regency, when he left the capital in April to join his army.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_26_">[[26]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Theophano may have had some input into his plans: according to Zonaras,
it was on her orders as regent that </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus</a></span></b><span face="Times">
had visited Constantinople to celebrate his triumph over Crete in April
963.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_27_">[[27]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
In his bid for power </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus</a></span></b><span face="Times">
was supported by the patriarch Polyeuctus and the military aristocracy,
as well as by the people of the city, while Basil 'the Nothus' had armed
3,000 of his servants in </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus'</a></span></b><span face="Times">
support and sent the fleet to join his forces. The vanquished Bringas was
banished to Paphlagonia and then forced into a monastery.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_28_">[[28]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus
II Phocas</a></span></b><span face="Times">, on becoming emperor, took
an oath that he would protect the rights of the young emperors, who still
had a long minority in front of them (</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basilii.html">Basil</a></span></b><span face="Times">
was probably five years of age and </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="connieVIIIp.html">Constantine</a></span></b><span face="Times">
two. </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basilii.html">Basil</a></span></b><span face="Times">
would not normally be able to rule in his own right until he was sixteen).</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_29_">[[29]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
From Theophano's point of view, matters had been satisfactorily resolved.
One of her supporters, who was an experienced and successful general, was
on the throne but prepared to protect the dynastic right of her sons until
they were of age. Scylitzes (who likes to think the worst of Theophano)
records that</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">
Nicephorus</a></span></b><span face="Times"> was in love with the empress,
with whom he had been conducting a passionate affair while in the capital
after </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romeii.html">Romanus
II's</a></span></b><span face="Times"> death. Bringas' disapproval of the
affair (according to Scylitzes) was the cause of his hostility to </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus</a></span></b><span face="Times">,
and the affair was well known and widely spoken of.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_30_">[[30]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
As we shall see below, this behaviour would not have been characteristic
of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus</a></span></b><span face="Times">,
and is probably yet another attempt to depict Theophano as a siren and
seductress and as an inappropriate regent for young emperors. There is
no need to postulate a love affair to explain Theophano's position; she,
of course, would have realised that once </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus</a></span></b><span face="Times">
was proclaimed emperor by his army, her best chance of keeping her sons
on the throne was to side with him. The <i>Historia Syntomos</i>, perhaps
by the historian Michael Psellus, suggests that she would have preferred
to marry </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johnItz.html">John
Tzimisces</a></span></b><span face="Times">, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus'</a></span></b><span face="Times">
nephew, but </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johnItz.html">Tzimisces</a></span></b><span face="Times">
himself supported </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus'</a></span></b><span face="Times">
claim to the throne<span size="-1">.</span></span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_31_">[[31]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
The suggestion that she had a preference for </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johnItz.html">John
Tzimisces</a></span></b><span face="Times"> is probably a reflection of
later events. The sudden death of Stephen Lecapenus, son of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romanusi.html">Romanus
I Lecapenus</a></span></b><span face="Times"> and hence brother of the
late empress <b><a href="helenap.html">Helena,</a></b> was now ascribed
to Theophano. This 'murder' was put down to her desire to protect her sons'
rights, for Stephen had been crowned co-emperor by his father and was in
exile at Methymne on Lesbos. Scylitzes considers his death on Easter Sunday
963, so advantageous to Theophano, as having been due to poisoning.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_32_">[[32]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">It was quite normal for </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus</a></span></b><span face="Times">,
as claimant to the throne, to marry the empress-regent in order to legitimise
his position. This was especially the case if he considered it his duty
to protect the rights of the young emperors. He had been born c. 912, and
thus was about fifty-one years of age (considerably older than Theophano,
who would have been born c. 940). He was also an ascetic in his lifestyle
and had for some time wished to become a monk, but the political situation
now overrode his wishes and he reluctantly ascended to the purple. According
to Leo the Deacon, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus</a></span></b><span face="Times">
had abstained both from sexual relations and from eating meat as a consequence
of the death of his son Bardas (Bardas had been accidentally killed by
a spear thrown by one of his cousins while they were playing); the monks
who advised him now persuaded him that, as emperor, it would be his duty
to remarry and start eating meat again. So, after his coronation on 16
August, he had Theophano moved to the convent at Petrion, and married her
on September 20. She was thus empress for the second time.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_33_">[[33]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">&nbsp;
At one point the marriage plans ran into difficulties because of the fact
that Nicephorus was the godfather of one or both of the young emperors,
an uncanonical relationship which alarmed the patriarch, but the situation
was eased by the explanation that it was actually </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus'</a></span></b><span face="Times">
father Bardas who had been their godfather.Scylitzes makes it clear that
this was in fact a deliberate distortion of the truth in order to allow
the marriage to proceed.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_34_">[[34]]</a></span></b>
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times">Nicephorus II Phocas</span></b></p></center>

<p><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus</a></span></b><span face="Times">
treated Theophano with great generosity and she was given rich garments
and wealthy estates appropriate to her rank.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_35_">[[35]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
After their marriage he continued on campaign for long periods and, together
with his nephew </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johnItz.html">John
Tzimisces</a></span></b><span face="Times">, now the Domestic of the <i>Scholae</i><span size="-1">
(or </span>commander-in-chief of the East) succeeded in reconquering Cyprus,
Cilicia and Syria, with Antioch falling to Michael Bourtzes in October
969, followed shortly afterwards by the capture of Aleppo. Theophano and
her children seem to have accompanied</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">
Nicephorus</a></span></b><span face="Times"> on at least some of these
campaigns: they were certainly in Cilicia in 964.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_36_">[[36]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Presumably the young emperors were being given first-hand acquaintance
with campaigning by their experienced step-father, though we could also
postulate that </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus</a></span></b><span face="Times">
was unwilling to leave Theophano behind in the capital (either because
he loved her passionately, or because he didn't trust her).</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">The alliance may not have been quite what Theophano
had expected or desired: this husband, some thirty years older than herself,
was dedicated to the practice of asceticism. He wore a hair-shirt under
his imperial robes to mortify his body, especially before special holy
days, was given to lengthy devotions, and preferred to sleep on the floor
under the bear-skin of his uncle the hermit Michael Maleinos, whom he especially
venerated.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_37_">[[37]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
He made no secret of the fact that he had wanted to become a monk. Nor
does he seem to have been particularly handsome (though our source here
is the hostile Liudprand of Cremona who had to explain away why he had
failed to bring back a suitable Byzantine princess to marry the young Otto
II in 968). He describes </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus</a></span></b><span face="Times">
as:</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">"a monster of a man, in height a pygmy, with a fat
head and little eyes like a mole. He is disfigured by a short, broad beard,
thick and greying, while a short neck scarcely an inch long further diminishes
his dignity. His thick, copious hair gives him a porcine look, and he has
the swarthy complexion of an Ethiopian. He is "the sort of man you would
not want to encounter in the middle of the night!"</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_38_">[[38]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus
</a></span></b><span face="Times">began
to lose popularity with the populace and church establishment towards the
end of his reign, due in part to the heavy taxation which was necessitated
by his policy of reconquest.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_39_">[[39]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Scylitzes, of course, deliberately puts <b><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus'</a></b>
actions in the worst possible light, but he was also the hero of a cycle
of popular songs and tales.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_40_">[[40]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
After the capture of Antioch, two months before his death, he was warned
by a monk of his approaching demise and he therefore took to sleeping on
the floor on all occasions instead of in a bed.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_41_">[[41]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Nevertheless, according to Leo the Deacon, even at this point his relations
with Theophano remained cordial, so he cannot have suspected her of any
disloyalty. She privately petitioned him on behalf of his nephew </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johnItz.html">John
Tzimisces</a></span></b><span face="Times">, who was in disgrace after
being demoted from the position of Domestic of the <i>Scholae</i><span size="-1">,
perhaps in 965,</span></span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_42_">[[42]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
requesting that he should be given another command and married to another
noble wife (Maria Scleraina, his first wife, had died). </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus</a></span></b><span face="Times">
at once agreed and Leo comments that </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus
</a></span></b><span face="Times">'habitually
granted Theophano more favours than were proper, under the impact of her
beauty'.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_43_">[[43]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Other sources state that relations between the couple had deteriorated,
perhaps because the marriage was never consummated. Zonaras says, for example,
that </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus</a></span></b><span face="Times">
had no desire for sexual relations, while Scylitzes considers that the
dislike was on Theophano's side, perhaps because she was offended by his
ascetic un-imperial behaviour. He appears to have led an entirely celibate
life, even during his marriage to Theophano, which historians consider
as the major factor in her hatred for him, though he still seems to have
been devoted to her.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_44_">[[44]]</a></span></b>
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times">Conspiracy and assassination</span></b></p></center>

<p><span face="Times">According to all the sources for the period, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johnItz.html">John
Tzimisces</a></span></b><span face="Times"> became Theophano's lover at
some point during her marriage to </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus</a></span></b><span face="Times">,
and they conspired to murder </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and make </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johnItz.html">John
</a></span></b><span face="Times">emperor.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_45_">[[45]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Perhaps Theophano had this contingency in mind when she requested </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johnItz.html">John's
</a></span></b><span face="Times">reinstatement.
He was soon back in favour after his return to Constantinople and visited
the palace on a daily basis. But some of his visits were to the empress
alone, and in secret. In fact, Theophano was said to have admitted him
through 'secret passages' to the women's quarters, while he intermittently
sent her, according to Leo the Deacon, sturdy fighters whom she concealed
in a secret chamber near her own suite of rooms (Scylitzes reduces the
number of hidden conspirators to one). </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus</a></span></b><span face="Times">
actually had the women's quarters searched after being warned of the conspiracy
by a priest at court, but the search may only have been perfunctory: the
chamberlain Michael failed to look into the room in which the conspirators
were hidden, either out of respect for the empress, or perhaps because
he too was in the plot.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_46_">[[46]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">On the night of 10 December 969 Theophano went to
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus</a></span></b><span face="Times">
as usual and told him that she had to make some arrangements about the
accommodation of the Bulgarian princesses who had arrived at court as the
potential brides for her two sons. As she would not be long he should leave
the bedroom door open and she would close it when she returned. </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus</a></span></b><span face="Times">
went through his normal lengthy prayers and then laid down to sleep on
the floor.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_47_">[[47]]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="johniitz.html">John's</a>
</span></b><span face="Times">assassins
meanwhile emerged from hiding and waited for </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johnItz.html">John
</a></span></b><span face="Times">on
the terrace of the palace. </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johnItz.html">John</a></span></b><span face="Times">
sailed into the harbour of the Bucoleon palace with his fellow conspirators:
the general Michael Bourtzes, Leo Abalantes, Atzupotheodorus, Leo Pediasimus
and Isaac Brachamius,</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_48_">[[48]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and they were hauled up in a basket attached to ropes despite the heavy
snow that was falling: the episode is beautifully depicted in the Madrid
Scylitzes manuscript.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_49_">[[49]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
On entering the emperor's bedroom they were terrified to find the bed empty,
thinking that their plot had been discovered, but a helpful eunuch from
the women's quarters (perhaps specifically stationed there by Theophano
to facilitate the murder) pointed out that the emperor was asleep on the
floor. </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus</a></span></b><span face="Times">
was brutally killed, with his nephew </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johnItz.html">John</a></span></b><span face="Times">
playing a significant role in the murder, striking </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus
</a></span></b><span face="Times">on
the head with his sword; the
<i>coup de grace</i> was delivered by one
of the other conspirators, Leo Abalantes.
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus'</a></span></b><span face="Times">
head was cut off and shown to his bodyguards to prevent their retaliating
against </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johnItz.html">John</a></span></b><span face="Times">,
who was already on the throne and acclaimed emperor.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_50_">[[50]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Theophano was not actually present at the murder, but clearly helped to
mastermind it, while her staff were part of the conspiracy. Indeed, one
account has her ladies at hand to hoist up the basket of conspirators.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_51_">[[51]]</a></span></b>

<p><b><span face="Times">The aftermath</span></b></p></center>

<p><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johnItz.html">John</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and Theophano were not the only stake-holders in events. Basil the Nothus,
whose influence had declined under </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus
II,</a></span></b><span face="Times"> was also involved and helped orchestrate
the acceptance of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johnItz.html">John</a></span></b><span face="Times">
as emperor. He was rewarded by being restored to the position of
<i>parakoimomenos
</i>or
chamberlain. Opposition was also forestalled by </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johnItz.html">John's
</a></span></b><span face="Times">proclamation
that the young</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basilii.html">
Basil II</a></span></b><span face="Times"> and </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="connieVIIIp.html">Constantine
VIII</a></span></b><span face="Times"> were to remain co-emperors.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_52_">[[52]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
But the assassination and its details could not be entirely hushed up.
The patriarch refused <b><a href="johnItz.html">John</a></b> entry to St
Sophia for his coronation and presented him with an ultimatum of three
conditions before he could be crowned: Theophano had to be removed from
the palace, the murderer of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus</a></span></b><span face="Times">
had to be punished, and </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus'</a></span></b><span face="Times">
measures against the church had to be revoked. Without hesitation, Theophano
was banished to an island in the sea of Marmara, either Proconnesus or
Prote, and </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus'
</a></span></b><span face="Times">'murderer'
Leo Abalantes (who dealt the critical blow according to Leo the Deacon),
or murderers (Abalantes and Atzupotheodorus according to Scylitzes and
Zonaras) were exiled. The blame was tacitly put on Theophano, with the
murderers seen as acting under her instructions, and following her exile
John was absolved of involvement in the conspiracy and crowned on Christmas
Day 969.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_53_">[[53]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times"><b><a href="johnItz.html">John Tzimisces</a></b>,
who had been born c. 925, was very unlike his ascetic uncle: another successful
general, he was extremely handsome and athletic (though short),</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_54_">[[54]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and fond of pleasure and luxurious living.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_55_">[[55]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
He was obviously of more promising 'imperial' material than</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">
Nicephorus</a></span></b><span face="Times"> and is invariably considered
to have been Theophano's lover before </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus'</a></span></b><span face="Times">
murder. Of course Theophano had planned to marry him. At the same time
we should not discount the possibility that Theophano had been motivated
by a concern for the succession. Zonaras suggests that there were rumours
that </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus</a></span></b><span face="Times">
was planning to have </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basilii.html">Basil
</a></span></b><span face="Times">and
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="connieVIIIp.html">Constantine</a></span></b><span face="Times">
castrated and put his brother, Leo, another successful general whom he
had dignified with the high rank o</span>f <i>curopalates</i><span size="-1">,
on the throne. T</span>he <i>Historia Syntomos</i> similarly states that
there was a rumour current that <b><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus </a></b>was
planning to castrate Theophano's sons and leave the throne to his brother,
and presents Leo as ambitious and the cause of the trouble between <b><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus</a></b>
and <b><a href="johnItz.html">John Tzimisces</a></b>. Perhaps as a result,
Theophano, tired in any case of <b><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus</a></b>,
therefore decided to get rid of him. According to the Syriac scholar Bar
Hebraeus, too, Theophano had not wished to marry <b><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus</a></b>,
and she heard that he was planning to make her sons eunuchs; hence she
brought men in women's dress into the church of the palace to have him
assassinated. The eleventh-century Arabic source Yahya of Antioch describes
in circumstantial detail, a quarrel between the imperial pair, originating
in <b><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus'</a></b> decision to leave his brother
Leo, the <i>curopalates</i>, as regent while he was on campaign. Theophano
was unable to persuade <b><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus</a></b> otherwise,
despite repeated quarrels, and so took<a href="johnItz.html"> John </a>as
her lover and instigated him to kill the emperor.<b><a href="#N_56_">[[56]]</a></b><span face="Times">
Whatever the truth of the matter, it is entirely possible that Theophano
was concerned by the pre-eminence which Leo Phocas had attained and saw
him as a threat to her sons' interests.</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">It was obviously in the interests of the new regime
to push as much of the blame as possible onto Theophano, and she was made
the scapegoat. She certainly had not acted alone, and the plot was supported
by a group of discontented aristocrats, former supporters of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus</a></span></b><span face="Times">,
in particular the generals </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johnItz.html">John
Tzimisces</a></span></b><span face="Times"> and Michael Bourtzes. Presumably</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johnItz.html">
John</a></span></b><span face="Times"> had originally intended to marry
Theophano and look after the interests of the young emperors as their step-father,
but he was prepared to compromise and jettison Theophano in return for
the support of the patriarch and church. It was therefore convenient for
John and Basil the Nothus to portray her as a treacherous and adulterous
assassin, and this was facilitated by the attitude of the patriarch Polyeuctus,
who was prepared to exonerate <b><a href="johnItz.html">John</a></b> as
a lesser party in the murder: the anointing at his coronation as emperor
was considered to wash away the guilt for the murder, in the same way as
baptism cancelled out any sins previously committed.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_57_">[[57]]</a></span></b>
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times">Theophano's exile</span></b></p></center>

<p><span face="Times">Theophano had no intention of taking this treatment
lying down. Obviously aggrieved at the way she had been treated, she managed
to escape from her monastic island retreat (where it is unlikely that she
was actually confined), and found her way to Constantinople, where she
took sanctuary in the Great Church of St Sophia. It was the job of the
reinstated chamberlain, Basil the Nothus, to forcibly remove her. Theophano
did not go without a struggle: she yelled insults at the emperor </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johnItz.html">John
</a></span></b><span face="Times">and
at Basil himself as a Scythian and barbarian (his mother was a Scythian,
or 'Slav', maidservant) and punched him on the jaw. To put her farther
out of reach seemed a good idea and she was sent to the newly created monastery
of Damideia in the distant Armeniac theme in the far east of Asia Minor.
Her mother, who had presumably followed her daughter's fortunes at court
though she is not otherwise mentioned in the sources, was also exiled.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_58_">[[58]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
This suggests that Theophano was not without family backing, and it would
be interesting to know the reactions of her sons (now some eleven and eight
years of age) to events.</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">As </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johnItz.html">John
</a></span></b><span face="Times">was
now without a bride, he looked around for a suitable princess to legitimise
his claim to the throne. On the advice of Basil the Nothus, he decided
on </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="theodorap.html">Theodora</a></span></b><span face="Times">,
daughter of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="connieviip.html">Constantine
VII Porphyrogenitus</a></span></b><span face="Times"> and aunt of the two
young emperors, and hence Theophano's older sister-in-law, now in her thirties
and a nun for most of the last decade. We are told that she was 'not distinguished
for her beauty and grace, but indisputably surpassed all other women in
prudence and every kind of virtue.' The marriage was a popular one and
the Constantinopolitans saw it as protecting the rights of the dynasty.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_59_">[[59]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">As the scapegoat for </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus'</a></span></b><span face="Times">
murder Theophano receives an overwhelmingly hostile press: Scylitzes calls
her an adulteress, and Zonaras a 'wanton'.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_60_">[[60]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
The epigrammatist John, Archbishop of Melitene, in his fictitious epitaph
for </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus
</a></span></b><span face="Times">written
in 988/989 as cited by Scylitzes, describes him as the 'conqueror of everything
except his wife':</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_61_">[[61]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">"he who used to be sharper than a sword to other
men, succumbed to a woman and a sword. He, who through his power used to
wield power over the whole earth, settled for a tiny part of the earth,
as if he were tiny himself. Even animals, I think, once stood in awe of
him; but his wife, supposedly his other half, killed him. He who did not
allow himself even a short moment of sleep at night, now sleeps the long
sleep in the grave . O Nikephoros, victorious in all respects but defeated
by a woman."</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_62_">[[62]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">According to Scylitzes the epigram was inscribed
on the emperor's tomb in the Church of the Holy Apostles, but Leo the Deacon
more realistically records that the decapitated corpse was buried stealthily
in one of the sarcophagi in the mausoleum of Constantine.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_63_">[[63]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
In another fictitious epigram, this time by the soldier John Geometres,
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus
</a></span></b><span face="Times">is
made to state that, despite all his military achievements, he 'fell in
the heart of the Palace, unable to escape the hand of his wife!'</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_64_">[[64]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Geometres further puts the blame for the murder solely on Theophano in
his monody on the death of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johnItz.html">John
Tzimisces</a></span></b><span face="Times">, in which </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johnItz.html">Tzimisces</a></span></b><span face="Times">
is depicted as a valiant leader who committed a tragic crime for which
he is heartily ashamed, which tacitly casts Theophano as the villain of
the piece.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_65_">[[65]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">Indeed, in the sources the blame is generally put
squarely onto Theophano, the adulterous wife's, shoulders. A popular satirical
song about Theophano's failure to marry </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johnItz.html">John</a></span></b><span face="Times">
has been preserved in a late sixteenth-century Cretan manuscript, which
records how she was exiled by her lover. She was apparently made the subject
of a satirical parade (<i>diapompeusis,</i> or 'parade of infamy') in the
streets of Constantinople,</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_66_">[[66]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
presumably at the time of the wedding of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johnItz.html">Tzimisces</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="theodorap.html">Theodora</a></span></b><span face="Times">
in November 970. In this popular diversion, an actress impersonating Theophano
apparently rode on a mule in a procession through the city or hippodrome,
while Polyeuctus and Basil the Nothus are implied as being the main agents
of her downfall:</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">'The blacksmith strikes his anvil, and he strikes
his neighbours too':</span>
<br><span face="Times">(for) the matchmaker and the princeling are standing
at the door.</span>
<br><span face="Times">Theophano wanted her cake (pie) and the beauty ate
it.</span>
<br><span face="Times">He who wore the coronation robe now donned a leather
hide,</span>
<br><span face="Times">and if wintry weather comes upon him, he will wear
his fur coat too;</span>
<br><span face="Times">(for) men with shrivelled cocks and hand-size arseholes</span>
<br><span face="Times">parade the murdering adulteress on the saddle of
a mule.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_67_">[[67]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">The princeling is the new emperor </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johnItz.html">Tzimisces</a></span></b><span face="Times">,
and the 'matchmaker' is the chamberlain Basil the Nothus, who arranged
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johnItz.html">Tzimisces'</a></span></b><span face="Times">
marriage to the middle-aged princess Theodora, the 'beauty' of line 3.
Theophano's thwarted hopes of her third imperial marriage are mocked, and
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johnItz.html">Tzimisces</a></span></b><span face="Times">
has clearly developed a thick skin, while a dig at the sexual proclivities
of the patriarch and chamberlain (both eunuchs), who engineered Theophano's
downfall, ends the ditty.</span>
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times">Return and reinstatement</span></b></p></center>

<p><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johnItz.html">John</a></span></b><span face="Times">
died in January 976 (rumour suggested that he had been poisoned by Basil
the Nothus) and </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basilii.html">Basil
II</a></span></b><span face="Times"> finally came to the throne at the
age of approximately seventeen. </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basilii.html">Basil</a></span></b><span face="Times">
clearly had no quarrel with his mother, perhaps suggesting that in his
view her primary motives had been to consolidate the imperial status of
her sons. He ended her six years of monastic exile by bringing her back
to the palace -- according to Scylitzes at the instigation of Basil the
Nothus, the chamberlain, who was to dominate the early years of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basilii.html">Basil's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
reign.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_68_">[[68]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Her reinstatement implies that she was not generally considered guilty
of the wholesale poisonings ascribed to her by Scylitzes, and that some
justification was seen for her involvement in </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus'
</a></span></b><span face="Times">murder:
after all, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johnItz.html">John
Tzimisces'</a></span></b><span face="Times"> role in it had carefully been
forgotten during his reign. At her return Theophano would have resumed
her rightful position as empress, remaining the senior Augusta when her
younger son</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="connieVIIIp.html">
Constantine </a></span></b><span face="Times">married Helena Alypia, a
marriage which she herself may have overseen. Significantly <b><a href="basilii.html">Basil</a></b>
himself was never to marry, perhaps as a result of a monastic vow he took
to ensure success over the Bulgars.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_69_">[[69]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">A Georgian tradition saw Theophano as becoming once
more a prominent figure at court, and depicts her as directing negotiations
with the Georgian prince David of Taiq following Bardas Sclerus' first
revolt in 976/7, early in her son's reign. She may also have been responsible
for supporting the foundation of the 'Iviron' monastery on Mt Athos reserved
for monks of Georgian nationality, for a manuscript preserved in Moscow
points to her as a benefactor.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_70_">[[70]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">The misogynistic hostility of the sources has made
them reject any motive for Theophano in the conspiracy and assassination
of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus
II </a></span></b><span face="Times">but the purely personal, yet this
should not be taken at face value. There is no evidence that she took any
other lover than </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johmItz.html">John
Tzimisces</a></span></b><span face="Times">, and that perhaps to protect
her children's dynastic interests, while the suggestion that she was sexually
promiscuous even in </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romeii.html">Romanus
II's </a></span></b><span face="Times">reign and that as a result </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basilii.html">Basil
II</a></span></b><span face="Times"> (who was red-haired) may have been
her son by one of the Varangian guard is quite unsubstantiated.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_71_">[[71]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Her motivation throughout </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus'
</a></span></b><span face="Times">reign
was arguably the desire to protect the throne for her children in the face
of a possible threat to their well-being: deposition and possible castration
at the hands of an imperial rival, a real threat potentially being present
in the person of Leo Phocas. Theophano attempted twice to influence the
transfer of power, in both cases hoping to ensure the protection of the
rights to the throne of her young sons. In the case of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus
Phocas </a></span></b><span face="Times">her support was critical for his
rise to power; in that of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johnItz.html">John
Tzimisces</a></span></b><span face="Times"> she unfortunately chose a fellow-conspirator
who was only too willing to make her the scapegoat for his own actions.
Even so, she ended her career at the court of her son </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basilii.html">Basil</a></span></b><span face="Times">
with all the dignity of a successful and respected Augusta.</span>
