<p><span class="text-2xl"><strong><span face="Times">PREFACE</span></strong></span></p>

<p><span face="Times">Some twenty years ago, in the course of research on Eunapius of Sardis, two studies of Timothy
Barnes drew me to the <em>Epitome de Caesaribus</em> <a href="#N_1_"><b>[[1]]</b></a>  My belief that there then existed no published
translation in any modern language convinced me that, should the opportunity arise, the
production of such a translation, together with a commentary, would be a worthwhile project.<a href="#N_2_"><b>[[2]]</b></a> A
1988 summer research grant from Canisius College allowed me to complete a rough version based
on the Teubner text of Franz Pichlmayr and Roland Gruendel.<a href="#N_3_"><b>[[3]]</b></a>  Kristin Ennis, my student
assistant checked my translation and supervised the collection of scholarship on the <em>Epitome</em> that
was to figure in the projected commentary.  But resumption of teaching duties and Ms. Ennis'
graduation forced a suspension of work on both translation and commentary, and these factors,
plus commitments to other research projects and administrative duties, made it impossible to
devote any extended period of time to the <em>Epitome</em>.  In light of this, I was happy to learn of Harry
Bird's plan to do a translation of and commentary on the <em>Epitome</em> for the series <em>Translated Texts
for Historians</em>, in which his volumes on Eutropius and Aurelius Victor have already appeared.<a href="#N_4_"><b>[[4]]</b></a>  </span></p>

<p><span face="Times">My recent association with the electronic encyclopedia <em>De Imperatoribus Romanis</em> has sent me
back to the <em>Epitome</em> in the belief that it might be worthwhile to make my translation, equipped
with suitable links to <em>De Imperatoribus Romanis</em>, available in electronic from.  These links, I
thought, would give to those interested access to some of what would have been included in my
commentary, while Professor Bird's forthcoming commentary would doubtless fill any remaining
void.  Michael DiMaio, of <em>De Imperatoribus Romanis</em>, agreed with my view and oversaw the
creation of the necessary connections between encyclopedia and translation.</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">The translation as it stands now is a thorough revision of the draft completed in 1988.  It retains
the Teubner textual divisions and also includes in boldface type within boldface brackets -- <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[ ]</strong></span> --
the pagination of that edition.  In addition, it reproduces in boldface the Teubner sigla for various
textual difficulties: <span class="text-2xl"><strong>*</strong></span> for a suspected lacuna, <span class="text-2xl"><strong> </strong></span> for a suspected corruption, and <span class="text-2xl"><strong>&lt; &gt;</strong></span> to enclose
editorial additions.  Greek works employed in the <em>Epitome</em> have been retained, followed by
translations within plain brackets, as, for example, at <em>Epitome</em> 16.5: "a disorder which the Greeks
call </span><img src="/aacugr.gif"><img src="/pgr.gif"><img src="/oacugr.gif"><img src="/pgr.gif"><img src="/lgr.gif"><img src="/eegr.gif"><img src="/xgr.gif"><img src="/igr.gif"><img src="/sfgr.gif"> [apoplexy]."  Likewise, plain brackets enclose translations of <em>cognomina</em>.  A
few Latin words -- <em>deus</em>, <em>dominatio</em>, <em>dominus</em>, <em>imperator</em>, <em>imperium</em>, <em>paterfamilias</em>, <em>potestas</em>,
<em>princeps</em>, <em>procurator</em>, and <em>rex</em> -- have been left untranslated, most because, to my mind, they
seemed to convey some important nuance too easily lost in translation.  For those uninterested in
nuance, their English meanings should appear evident.  Proper names of individuals and peoples
appear in their latinate form except in very few instances - for example, "Constantine" rather than
"Constantinus" (which is retained for Constantine's father and for Constantine's son of the same
name) and "Alans" rather than "Alani."  "Valentinian" is the emperor from 364-375;
"Valentinianus," his son, emperor from 375-392.  My goal has not been to be consistent, but
merely consistent enough.  Because Professor Bird's work will contain a full bibliography, none is
offered here.</p>

<p><strong><span face="Times">THE STYLE OF LIFE AND THE MANNERS</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span face="Times">OF THE <em>IMPERATORES</em></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span face="Times">Abbreviated from the Books of Sextus Aurelius Victor</span></strong></p>

<p><span face="Times">1</span></p>

<p><strong></strong><span face="Times">In the seven hundred and twenty-second year from the foundation of the city, but the four hundred
and eightieth from the expulsion of the kings, the custom was resumed at Rome of absolute
obedience to one man, with, instead of <em>rex</em>, the appellation <em>imperator</em> or the more venerable name
<a href="auggie.html"><b>Augustus</b></a>.  2.  Accordingly, Octavian, whose father was Octavius, a senator, and who was
descended in his mother's line through the Julian family from Aeneas (but called Gaius Caesar, his
grandmother's brother) was then given the cognomen Augustus on account of his victory.  3. 
Placed in control, he, <em>per se</em>, exercised tribunician <em>potestas</em>.  4.  The region of Egypt, difficult to
enter because of the inundation of the Nile and impassable because of swamps, he made into a
form of province.  5.  By the labor of soldiers, he opened canals, which through neglect had been
clogged with the slime of ages, to make Egypt a bountiful supplier of the city's ration.  6.  In his
time, two hundred million allotments of grain were imported annually from Egypt to the city.  7. 
He joined to the number of provinces for the Roman people the Cantabri and Aquitani, Raeti,
Vindelici, Dalmatae.  The Suevi and Chatti he destroyed, the Sigambri he transferred to Gallia. 
The Pannonii <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[134]</strong></span> he added as tributaries.  The peoples of the Getae and Basternae, aroused to
wars, he compelled to concord.  8.  To him Persia sent hostages and granted the authority of
creating kings.  9.  To him the Indians, Scythians, Garamantes, and Aethiopians sent legations
with gifts.  10.  Indeed, he so detested disturbances, wars and dissensions that he never ordered a
war against any race except for just reasons.  And he used to say that to be of a boastful and most
capricious mind through the ardor of a triumph and on account of a laurel crown -- that is barren,
fruitless foliage -- plunged the security of citizens into danger by the uncertain outcomes of
battles; 11. and that nothing whatever was more appropriate to a good <em>imperator</em> than temerity:
whatever was being done properly, happened quickly enough; 12. and that arms must never be
taken up except in the hope of a very significant benefit, lest, because of heavy loss for a trifling
reward, the sought-after victory be like a golden hook for fishermen, the damage of which,
through its having been broken off or lost, no gain of the catch is able to compensate.  13.  In his
time, a Roman army and tribunes and propraetor were destroyed beyond the Rhine.  So much did
he mourn what had transpired that, made unsightly by his dress, hair, and the remaining symbols
of mourning, he struck his head with a powerful blow.  14.  He used to censure an innovation of
his uncle, too, who, calling the soldiers comrades in novel and charming fashion, while he affected
to ingratiate himself, had weakened the <em>auctoritas</em> of the <em>princeps</em>.  15.  Indeed, toward citizens he
was most clemently disposed.  16.  He appeared faithful toward his friends, the most eminent of
whom were Maecenas on account of his taciturnity, Agrippa on account of his endurance and the
self-effacedness of his labor.  Moreover, he used to delight in Virgil.  He was a rare one, indeed,
for making friendships; most steadfast toward retaining them.  17.  He was so devoted to liberal
studies, especially to eloquence, that no day slipped by, not even on campaign, without him
reading, writing, and declaiming.  18.  He introduced laws, some new, others revised, <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[135]</strong></span> in his
own name. 19.  He added to and ornamented Rome with many structures, glorying in the remark:
"I found a city of bricks, I left her a city of marble."  20.  He was gentle, pleasant, urbane, and of
charming disposition, handsome in his entire physique, but with large eyes, rapidly moving the
pupils of which, in the fashion of the brightest stars, he used to explain with a smile that men
turned from his gaze as from the intense rays of the sun.  When a certain soldier averted his eyes
from his face and was asked by him why he so behaved, he answered: "Because I am unable to
bear the lightning of your eyes."</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">21.  For all that, so great a man did not lack vices.  For he was somewhat impatient, a bit irascible,
secretly envious, openly fatuous; furthermore, moreover, he was most desirous of holding
dominion -- more than it is possible to imagine -- , an avid player at dice.  22.  And though he
was much at table or drink, to a certain degree, in fact, abstaining from sleep, he nevertheless used
to gratify his lust to the extent of the dishonor of his public reputation.  For he was accustomed to
lie among twelve catamites and an equal number of girls.  23.  Also, possessed by the love of the
wife of another, when his wife Scribonia had been set aside, he joined Livia to himself as if with
her husband's consent.  Of this Livia there were already two sons, Tiberius and Drusus.  24.  And
while he was a servant of luxury, he was nevertheless a most severe castigator of the same vice, in
the manner of men who are relentless in correcting the vices in which they themselves avidly
indulge.  For he damned to exile the poet Ovid, also called Naso, because he wrote for him the
three booklets of the <em>Art of Love</em>.  25.  And because he was of exuberant and cheerful spirit, he
was amused by every type of spectacle, especially those with an unknown species and infinite
number of wild animals. </span></p>

<p><span face="Times">26.  When he had passed through seventy-seven years, he died at Nola of a disease.  27.  Yet
some write that he was killed by a deception of Livia, who, since she had gained information that
Agrippa (the son of her stepdaughter, <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[136]</strong></span> whom, as a result of his mother-in-law's hatred, he
had relegated to an island) was to be recalled, feared that, when he had obtained control of affairs,
she would be punished.  28.  Thereupon, the senate resolved that the dead or murdered man
should be decorated with numerous and novel honors.  For in addition to the title "Father of his
Country," which it had proclaimed, it dedicated temples to him at Rome and throughout the most
celebrated cities, with all proclaiming openly: "Would that he either had not been born or had not
died!"  29.  The first alternative said of a most base beginning, the second of a splendid outcome. 
For in pursuing the principate he was held an oppressor of liberty and in ruling he so loved the
citizens that once, when a three-days' supply of grain was discerned in the storehouses, he would
have chosen to die by poison if fleets from the provinces were not arriving in the interim.  30. 
When these fleets had arrived, the safety of the fatherland was attributed to his felicity.  He ruled
fifty-six years, twelve with Antony, but forty-six alone.  31.  Certainly he never would have drawn
the power of the state to himself or retained it so long if he had not possessed in abundance great
gifts of nature and of conscious efforts. </span></p>

<p><span face="Times">2</span></p>

<p><span face="Times"><a href="tiberius.html"><b>Claudius Tiberius</b></a>, son of Livia, stepson of Octavian Caesar, ruled twenty-three years.  2.  Since
he used to be called Claudius Tiberius Nero, he was, because of his drinking, aptly referred to in
jests as Caldius Biberius Mero ["Imbiber of Hot, Straight Wine"].  3.  Before <em>imperium</em> was
assumed, he was, under Augustus, sagacious enough and fortunate enough in war that not
undeservedly was control of the state entrusted to him.  4.  He possessed much knowledge of
literature.  He was quite renowned for eloquence, but in character most base, grim, greedy,
insidious, pretending that he wished what he did not; he seemed hostile to those in whose counsel
he was taking pleasure, but well-disposed to those whom he despised.  5.  He was better in spur-of-the-moment responses and deliberations than in those planned in advance.  6.  Indeed, he
fictitiously rejected the principate offered him by the senators (which he certainly did with
cunning), <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[137]</strong></span> darkly exploring what each was saying or thinking: an affair which brought ruin
to each who was good.  7.  For when men who reckoned that he was sincerely declining the
immensity of the imperial burden expressed sentiments in favor of his choice in a long speech, they
unexpectedly met their final fates.  8.  With Archelaus, their king, removed, he restored
Cappadocia to a province.  He suppressed the banditries of the Gaetulii.  Marobodus, King of the
Suevi, he shrewdly encompassed.  9.  While he punished with great fury innocent and guilty,
members of his own family and outsiders alike, with the skills of the army enfeebled, Armenia was
ravaged by the Parthians, Moesia by the Dacians, Pannonia by the Sarmatians, and Gallia by
neighboring peoples.  10.  After his eighty-eighth year and fourth month, he was murdered in an
intrigue of Caligula.</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">3</span></p>

<p><span face="Times"><a href="gaius.html"><b>Caligula</b></a> ruled four years.  2.  He was the son of <a href="germanic.html"><b>Germanicus</b></a>, and, since he had been born in the
camp, was given a cognomen of a military footwear (that is, <em>caligula</em>).  3.  Before his principate
he was accepted by and dear to all, but in his principate he was such that it was commonly said
with justification that there had never been a <em>dominus</em> more terrible than he.  4.  In fact, he stained
his own three sisters with defilement.  5.  He went about in the dress of his personal gods; he used
to claim that he was Jove on account of his incest, and Liber, moreover, from his bacchanalian
chorus.  6.  I am uncertain whether it will have been proper to write about this for posterity,
except perhaps since it helps to know everything about the <em>principes</em>, so that the unfit at least may
shun such enormities through fear of their reputation.  7.  In his palace, he subjected noble
matrons to public wantonness.  8.  He first, crowned with a diadem, ordered himself to be called
<em>dominus</em>.  9.  In the space of the three miles which lies between the moles in the Puteolan Gulf, he
arranged ships in a double line and in a two-horse chariot drove down a roadway firmed up by an
accumulation of sand to approximate earth <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[138]</strong></span> as if celebrating a triumph, dressed in a golden
military cloak, with a horse ornamented in trappings of office and a bronze crown.  10.  He
perished afterward, struck down by the soldiers.</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">4</span></p>

<p><span face="Times"><a href="claudius.html"><b>Claudius</b></a> Titus, son of Tiberius' brother Drusus, paternal uncle of Caligula, ruled fourteen years. 
2.  When the senate had thought that the family of the Caesars had been exterminated, he was
discovered by the soldiers in a hiding place that ill became him, and, since he was simpleminded,
he seemed quite harmless to those ignorant men and was made <em>imperator</em>.  3.  He was obedient to
his stomach, wine, vile lust; simpleminded and almost doltish; lazy and tremulous; subject to the
dictates of his freedmen and wife.  4.  In his time, Scribonius Camillus was created <em>imperator</em> in
Dalmatia and killed forthwith.  The Mauri set the provinces ablaze; a force of Musulamii was cut
to pieces.  The Claudian Aqueduct<em> </em>was opened at Rome.  5.  Messalina, his wife, was from the
first indulging indiscriminately in extramarital affairs as if it were her legal prerogative: as a result
of what she did, many men who abstained through fear were killed.  Then, more violently aroused,
she had certain of the more noble wives and maidens put up for sale with herself in the fashion of
prostitutes, and males were compelled to attend.  But if someone ever bristled at such enormities,
he was savaged by means of a contrived charge against himself and his entire family, so that he
seemed to be more in the power of the ruling man rather than the ruling wife.  6.  In the same way,
his freedmen, having attained the highest power, were defiling everything with debaucheries, exile,
murder, and proscriptions.  7.  From among these men, he made Felix prefect of the legions in
Judaea.  After the Britannic triumph, to Posidonius the eunuch, <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[139]</strong></span> along with the bravest of
the soldiers, he gave arms and medals for a gift, as if to one who had taken part in the victory.  He
allowed Polybius to walk between the consuls.  Narcissus, the secretary, used to surpass them all,
deporting himself as <em>dominus</em> of the <em>Dominus</em> himself; and Pallas was exalted by the praetorian
insignia.  They were so rich that, with him debating about the bankruptcy of the fisc, it was most
humorously noised about in a famous elegy that there would be wealth in great profusion for him,
if, by the two freedmen, he were admitted into a partnership.  9.  In his times, the Phoenix was
seen in Egypt, a bird which they say flies every five hundred years from Arabia to remembered
locations; and in the Aegean Sea an island suddenly sank.  10.  He married Agrippina, daughter of
Germanicus, his own brother, who, procuring the empire for her own son, first killed her
stepchildren in multiform intrigues, then, by poison, her husband himself.  11.  He lived sixty-four
years; his death was kept secret a long while, as once before in the case of Tarquinius Priscus.  12. 
While his attendants simulated grief, Nero, his stepson, obtained the rights of <em>imperium</em>. </span></p>

<p><span face="Times">5</span></p>

<p><span face="Times"><a href="nero.html"><b>Domitius Nero</b></a>, scion of Domitius Ahenobarbus, his father, and Agrippina, his mother, ruled
thirteen years.  2.  For five years he seemed bearable, whence some have reported that Trajan was
accustomed to say that the <em>principes</em> as a group were far different than Nero -- for a five-year
period.  3.  In the city, he constructed an amphitheater and baths.  4.  Pontus he reduced to the
status of a province with the permission of King Polemo, from whom Pontus Polemoniacus is
named, as likewise the Cottian Alps from the dead King Cottius.  5.  For indeed he passed the
remainder of his life shamelessly, so that it is embarrassing to commemorate any of this.  He went
so far that, sparing neither his own decency nor that of others, at last, veiled in the manner of a
bride-to-be, <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[140]</strong></span> with dowry paid, with everyone crowding together in festive fashion, he was
married in the presence of the senate.  Covered with the skin of a wild animal, he used to forage
the sexual organs of either sex with his face.  He even contaminated with defilement his own
mother, whom he afterward killed.  After their husbands were slain, he married Octavia and the
Sabina with the cognomen Poppaea.  6.  Then Galba, proconsul of Hispania, and Gaius Julius
usurped <em>imperium</em>.  7.  When Nero learned that Galba approached and that the senate had
resolved that, according to ancestral custom, when his neck had been thrust into a yoke, he was to
be beaten to death with rods, he, completely deserted, left the city in the middle of the night with
Phaon, Epaphroditus and Neophytus, and the eunuch Sporus, whom once, after he had been
castrated, he had tried to transform into a woman; and he pierced himself with a blow of his
sword, with the impure eunuch about whom we spoke aiding his trembling hand while, since no
one had been found earlier by whom he might be struck, he soberly exclaimed: "So, do I have
neither friend nor foe?  I lived shamelessly, let me die shamefully."  8.  He perished in the thirty-second year of his life.  The Persians had been so delighted with him that they sent legations
furnishing materials for constructing a monument.  9.  Otherwise the provinces as a whole and all
Rome exulted in his death to such a degree that the urban masses donned the caps of freedmen
and celebrated manumission, as if they had been delivered from a savage <em>dominus</em>.</span></p>

<p><span face="Times"><a href="galba.html"><b>Galba</b></a>, scion of the noble clan of the Sulpicii, ruled seven months and an equal number of days.  2. 
He was disreputable toward young men, intemperate with regard to eating, and arranged
everything in a council of his three friends, that is, Vinius, Cornelius, and Icelius, to such a degree
that they were just as much residents of the Palatine mansion and used to be referred to commonly
as "the tutors."  3.  Before <em>dominatio</em> was assumed, he administered many provinces with
distinction, treating the soldiers most severely, so that, when he entered <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[141]</strong></span> the camps, the
saying was quickly spread: "Learn to soldier, soldier; this is Galba, not Gaetilicus."  4.  When he
was in the seventy-third year of his life, while he advanced in his armor to calm legions inflamed
by the faction of Otho, he was killed near the Lake of Curtius.</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">7</span></p>

<p><span face="Times"><a href="otho.html"><b>Salvius Otho</b></a>, sprung from distinguished ancestors from the town Ferentanum, ruled three months
-- shameless in his entire life, in his youth most of all.  2.  Defeated by Vitellius first at
Placentium, then at Betriacum, he transfixed himself with a sword in the thirty-seventh year of his
life -- so beloved to his own troops that, when his body was seen, a great many died by their own
hands.  </span></p>

<p><span face="Times">8</span></p>

<p><span face="Times"><a href="vitell.html"><b>Vitellius</b></a>, sprung from noble stock (his father, Lucius Vitellius, a consul) ruled eight months.  2. 
He was violent, cruel, and avaricious with profusion.  3.  In his time, Vespasian seized the
principate in Oriens; conquered by his soldiers in a battle held under the walls of the city, Vitellius,
with his hands bound behind him, was led from the palace to which he had removed himself and
was paraded as a show before the mob.  4.  And lest this man, at all events shameless to the last of
the evils which he had done, lower a blushing face, with a sword placed under his chin, half-nude,
while many assaulted his face with filth and excrement and, in speech, with other dirt more
shameful, he was dragged down the Gemonian Steps where he had ordered Sabinius, Vespasian's
brother, to be killed.  5.  Transfixed by many blows, he perished.  He lived fifty-seven years.  6. 
All these men whom I have briefly touched upon, especially the family of the Caesars, possessed
learning, culture, and eloquence to such a degree that surely they would have covered their
modest indiscretions, if they were not -- apart from Augustus -- excessive in all vices together.  </span></p>

<p><span face="Times">9</span></p>

<p><span face="Times"><a href="vespasia.html"><b>Vespasian</b></a> ruled ten years.  2.  Among his good deeds, his disregard of animosities was singular
<span class="text-2xl"><strong>[142]</strong></span> to the degree that he wed the daughter of his enemy Vitellius, who had been given a most
lavish dowry, to a very eminent man.  3.  He used to bear patiently the agitation of his friends, as
he was very witty, responding to their jibes with jests.  For he wittily softened Licinius Mucianus,
with whom as an aide he had reached <em>imperium</em>, insolent by reason of his merits, saying, when
another man, a common acquaintance, had been summoned, this alone: "I know that I am a man." 
4.  But why is this a surprise with respect to his friends, since he even made light of the oblique
pronouncements of advocates and the contumacy of philosophers?  5. Briefly put, he restored the
orb of the earth, long faint and feeble.  For, first of all, unless they had conducted themselves far
too violently, he preferred to mollify followers of the tyrant rather than to destroy them after they
had been tortured, having reckoned most prudently that nefarious works are carried out by the
majority of the men through fear.  6.  Moreover, by laws most equitable and by instruction, and
what is stronger, by the example of his own life, he had abolished the majority of vices.  7.  He
was, nevertheless, weak, as some people wrongly think, with regard to money, since it is
sufficiently agreed that through a shortage in the treasury and through the ruin of the cities he had
sought new (nor afterward continued) payments of taxes.  8.  If owners were lacking, he repaired,
by means of resources granted to those willing, a Rome disfigured by fires and by aged ruins, the
Capitol, the Temple of Peace, the monuments of the Claudii, and erected many new structures.  9. 
Through all lands, as is Roman custom, cities were renovated with surprising care; roads were
fortified with the greatest labors.  10.  Then the hills along the Flaminian Way were cut through
for easy passage -- what is commonly called the "Punctured Peak."  11.  A thousand clans were
composed, since he had with great difficulty found two hundred, the majority having been
exterminated by the savageness of the tyrants.  12.  By fear alone, Volgeses, King of Parthia, was
compelled to peace.  13.  The Syria for which Palestina is the name, <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[143]</strong></span> and Cilicia, and
Trachia and Commagene, which today we call Augustophratensis, were added to the provinces. 
Judaea, too, was added.  14.  When friends warned him to beware of Mettius Pomposianus, about
whom a rumor had been spread that he would rule, he made him a consul, joking in the following
cavil: "When will there ever be a memory of a gift so great?"  15.  Indeed, he maintained a
uniform mode of life during his whole reign.  He stayed awake at night and, when public affairs
were finished, he admitted his intimates, putting on his shoes and royal vesture while being
saluted.  Then, after whatever business that had come up was heard, he exercised with a ride, then
rested; finally, when he had washed, he, in a quite convivial frame of mind, used to attend dinner. 
16.  Affection compels one to say more about a good <em>imperator</em>, whom, after fifty-six years from
Augustus' death, the Roman state, bled by the savageness of the tyrants, chanced upon, as if by
some divine destiny, lest it go completely to ruin.  17.  And so, passing the sixty-ninth year of his
life, he died, mingling with serious matters the jests in which he always took pleasure.  18. 
Indeed, first, when a comet had appeared, he said, "That concerns the King of Persia" (whose hair
is rather long).  Then, exhausted by an exudation of the bowels, he rose up and said, "It becomes
an <em>imperator</em> to depart the earth standing."  </span></p>

<p><span face="Times">10</span></p>

<p><span face="Times"><a href="titus.html"><b>Titus</b></a>, called also by his father's name Vespasian, the offspring of a freedwoman mother named
Domitilla, ruled two years, two months, and twenty days.  2.  Most earnestly devoted from
boyhood to the admirable pursuits of probity, soldiery, and letters, he displayed gifts of mind and
body in whatever he attempted.  3.  When he accepted the care of the fatherland, it is incredible
how much he surpassed the man whom he was replacing, especially in clemency, liberality, honor,
and contempt of wealth, things which were quite dear to him because, as a result of some things
done while he was yet a private citizen, he was believed to have been a particularly passionate
lover of luxury <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[144]</strong></span> and of vice.  4.  For, during his father's rule, he obtained the praetorian
prefecture and, by means of agents who, spreading insidious things through the theaters and
camps, demanded punishment, he oppressed as if convicted of a crime whoever was suspect or
opposed to him.  Among them, he ordered Caecena, a consular, who had been summoned to
dinner and who had scarcely yet left his place at the table, to be slaughtered on account of
suspicion of the debauched Bernice, his own wife.  5.  Moreover, under his father, verdicts in legal
disputes were put up for sale <span class="text-2xl"><strong>*</strong></span> him desirous of plunder, from which all in general, envisioning and
invoking Nero, gravely accepted that he had reached the height of affairs.  6.  But these things,
having been turned to the better, brought him immortal glory to such a degree that he was called
"Treasure" and "Lover of the Human Race."  7.  Then, as he submitted to regal constancy, he
ordered Bernice, spurning her marriage with him, to return home, and the flocks of the effeminate
to depart -- an act by which he offered, as it were, a sign of intemperance altered.  Henceforth,
while successors were accustomed to confirm awards and concessions from earlier
<em>principes</em>, once he took control by means of an edict he spontaneously decreed such things for
those who possessed them.  9.  Also, on a certain day, recollecting in the evening that he had not
awarded anything to anyone, he said in a laudable and lofty remark, "Friends, we have wasted a
day" (because he was of great liberality).  10.  Indeed, he carried clemency to the point that he
first admonished two men of most distinguished rank because they had conspired against him and
were unable to deny that a crime had been contemplated, and afterward he ordered the men, who
had been led to the arena, to sit on either side of him, and, when a sword of the mirmillons whose
combats were being viewed was intentionally requested, as if for the purpose of examining its
edge, he gave it to one and then to the other; to those men, shocked and awed at his courage, he
said, "Do you not see that powers are bestowed by Fate, <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[145]</strong></span> and that action prompted by the
hope of gaining or fear of losing them is expended in vain?"  11.  In tears he often supplicated his
brother Domitian, too, who was hatching plots and agitating friends among the soldiers, not to
desire to attain by parricide what by his own volition was going to fall to him and what, since he
was a co-holder of <em>potestas</em>, he now possessed.  12.  In his time, Mount Vesuvius in Campania
began to flame, and at Rome there was a fire for three days and three nights without an evening's
respite.  13.  Pestilence, too, there was, as much as scarcely ever before.  14.  These evils,
nevertheless, he relieved with no one being burdened, by means of all sorts of remedies, now
renewing the sick through his very own person, now consoling the afflicted with the deaths of his
own family members.  15.  He lived forty-one years and died among the Sabines, on the same
estate as his father.  16.  His death was scarcely able to be believed, so much lamentation excited
the city and provinces that, calling him a "Public Treasure," as we have said, they mourned the orb
of the earth as if it had been deprived of a perpetual guardian.  </span></p>

<p><span face="Times">11</span></p>

<p><span face="Times"><a href="domitian.html"><b>Domitian</b></a>, son of Vespasian and Domitilla, the freedwoman, brother of Titus, ruled fifteen years. 
2.  At first, he feigned clemency nor did he seem at this point too inactive at home or in war; on
which account he conquered the Chatti and Germans.  3.  Law he pronounced most equitably.  At
Rome he constructed many buildings, whether already begun or from the foundations.  4.  With
exemplars sought from everywhere, especially Alexandria, he restored libraries consumed by fire. 
5.  He was so skilled at archery that his arrows flew between the spread fingers of the extended
hand of a man positioned far away.  6.  Then, cruel as a result of killings, he began to conduct
executions of good men and, in the fashion of C. Caligula, forced himself to be called <em>dominus</em> and<em>
deus</em>; and slothful, he, with everything laughingly set aside, used to pursue swarms of flies.  7.  He
was mad with lust, the foul exercise of which, in the language of the Greeks, he used to call
</span><img src="/kgr.gif"><img src="/lgr.gif"><img src="/igr.gif"><img src="/ngr.gif"><img src="/ogr.gif"><img src="/pgr.gif"><img src="/aacugr.gif"><img src="/lgr.gif"><img src="/eegr.gif"> ["bed-wrestling"].  8.  Hence, to someone inquiring <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[146]</strong></span> if anyone was in the
palace, the response: "Not even a fly."  9.  Inflamed by these depravities of his and most of all by
an injury of words, as a result of which he used to suffer to be called a male prostitute, Antonius,
supervisor of Germania Superior, seized <em>imperium</em>.  10.  With him brought low in battle through
Norbanus Lappius, Domitian, more abominable by far toward the entire family of mankind, even
toward his own family members, began raging in the fashion of wild animals.  11.  Therefore, in
fear of his cruelty and of their own conscience, many formed a plot, with the head chamberlain
Parthenius and Stephanus the instigators, and then Clodianus, who expected punishment on
account of fraud involving intercepted funds, with Domitia, the tyrant's wife, who dreaded torture
by the <em>princeps</em> on account of her love of the actor Paris, also were received into the plot.  12. 
They pierced Domitian with many wounds after the forty-fifth year of his life.  13.  And the senate
decreed that his funeral be carried out in the fashion of a gladiator and that his name must be
obliterated.  14.  In his time, the Secular Games were celebrated. </p>

<p><span face="Times">15.  Until this time, men born in Rome or through Italy controlled <em>imperium</em>; henceforth
foreigners.  For this reason, it is ascertainable that the city Rome has been increased by the virtue
of outsiders.  For what was the quite wise and moderate Nerva?  What the quite divine Trajan? 
What the quite eminent Hadrian?  </span></p>

<p><span face="Times">12</span></p>

<p><span face="Times"><a href="nerva.html"><b>Cocceius Nerva</b></a>, born at the town Narnia, ruled sixteen months, ten days.  2.  When he had
accepted <em>imperium</em> and a rumor quickly arose that Domitian lived and would soon be at hand, he
was sufficiently terrified so that, pale and unable to speak, he barely held firm.  But, bolstered by
assurances received from Parthenius, he was turned to festive blandishments. 3.  When he had
been joyfully received by the senate in the senate house, , alone from all Arrius Antoninus - a
shrewd man and a very close friend of his -, wisely describing the lot of rulers, <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[147]</strong></span> embraced
him and said that he congratulated the senate, people, and provinces, however, in no way Nerva
himself, for whom to escape ever-evil <em>principes</em> had been better than, enduring the force of so
great a burden, subjections not only to troubles and risks, but also to the assessment of enemies
and, equally, of friends, who, since they presume they deserve everything, are bitterer than even
enemies themselves, if they do not obtain something.  4.  He exempted whatever had previously
accrued to the taxes (called the "burdens"); he relieved afflicted cities; girls and boys born to
indigent parents he ordered fed at public expense through the towns of Italy.  5.  Lest he be
alarmed by the approach of the malevolent, he was admonished in the following fashion in a
comment of Junius Mauricus, a steadfast man: invited to a social gathering, when he had observed
that Veiento, who had, indeed, enjoyed consular honor under Domitian, yet who had persecuted
many with secret accusations, was present, when among the conversations mention was made of
Catullus, a principle calumniator, and Nerva was saying, "What would he be doing now, if he had
survived Domitian?", Mauricus said, "He would be dining with us."  He was a most learned man
and a frequent arbitrator of disputes.  6.  Calpurnius Crassus, who was tempting the minds of the
troops with grand promises, having been discovered and having confessed, he removed, along
with his wife, to Tarentum, while the senate chided his leniency.  7.  And when Domitian's
murderers were being called to execution, he was so consternated that he was unable to keep from
vomiting or from a paroxysm of the bowels, but nevertheless he vehemently objected, saying that
it was more fitting to die than to befoul the authority of <em>imperium</em> as a result of the authors of the
power that he was to acquire having been betrayed.  8.  But the soldiers, with the <em>princeps</em>
ignored, slaughtered those they sought, Petronius with a single blow, but Parthenius after his
genitals had been torn out and shoved into his mouth <span class="text-2xl"><strong> </strong></span>, with Casperius bought off by means of
huge payoffs, who, more insolent than the savage crime, compelled Nerva to give thanks among
the people to the soldiers, since they had killed the most base and wicked of all <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[148]</strong></span> mortals.  9. 
He admitted Trajan to the position of son and to a share of <em>imperium</em>; with him he lived three
months.  10.  It was he who, with his voice rising in anger as he shouted out very many things
against someone by the name Regulus, was seized by a sweat.  11.  When it abated, the excessive
shivering of his body revealed the beginnings of a fever, nor much later did he end his life in his
sixty-third year of age.  12.  His body, as formerly that of Augustus, was conveyed with honor by
the senate and buried in the tomb of Augustus.  On the day on which he died, there was an eclipse
of the sun.  </span></p>

<p><span face="Times">13</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">Ulpius Trajan, from the city Tudertina, called Ulpius from his grandfather, Trajan from Traius, the
founder of his paternal line, or named thus from his father Trajan, ruled twenty years.  2.  He
showed himself to be the sort of man of state that the awestruck abilities of consummate writers
have scarcely and with difficulty been able to express.  3.  He accepted <em>imperium</em> at Agrippina, the
noble colony in Gallia, possessing diligence in military matters, mildness in civil, and largess in
supporting citizens.  4.  And since there are two things expected of egregious <em>principes</em> --
integrity at home, bravery in arms, and prudence in both -- so great was the quantity of what is
best in him that, as if in some due proportion, he seemed to have combined the virtues, except that
he was somewhat given to food and drink.  5.  He was liberal toward friends and, as much as befit
his style of life, thoroughly enjoyed associations.  6.  He established baths in honor of Sura, with
whose zeal he had secured <em>imperium</em>.  7.  With regard to this, he appeared over and above what
was necessary to wish to dedicate everything in his name, when it was enough to have said that he
improved or repaired.  8.  He was certainly tolerant of labor, a devotee of whatever was best and
<span class="text-2xl"><strong>[149]</strong></span> warlike.  He highly esteemed very straightforward characters or men most erudite,
although he himself was of slight theoretical knowledge and moderately eloquent.  9.  But of
justice and human and divine law he was as much a deviser of the new as a guardian of the
traditional.  10.  All of these things were viewed the greater, because, with the Roman state
destroyed and prostrated through many and fearsome tyrants, a divinity was thought to have been
opportunely bestowed toward the remedy of evils so great to the extent that quite numerous and
wondrous things proclaimed his coming.  Among these, the main cornice proclaimed in Attic
speech from the pediment of the Capitol: </span><img src="/kgr.gif"><img src="/agr.gif"><img src="/lgr.gif"><img src="/ohcirgr.gif"><img src="/sfgr.gif">
 <img src="/esagr.gif"><img src="/sgr.gif"><img src="/tgr.gif"><img src="/agr.gif"><img src="/igr.gif"> ["It will be well"].  11.  The ashes of
his cremated body were borne back to Rome and interred in the Forum of Trajan under his
column, and an image was placed above it, just as triumphators are accustomed to do, entering the
city, with the senate preceding and the army.  12.  At that time, more destructively by far than
under Nerva, the Tiber flooded with great devastation of close-by buildings; and there occurred a
serious earthquake through many provinces and a dreadful plague and famines and fires.  13.  To
all these things Trajan brought relief through remedies usually excellent, decreeing that the height
of houses not exceed sixty feet on account of proneness to collapse and deadly expenses if ever
things such as this should come to pass.  14.  From this he was deservedly called "Father of his
Country."  He lived sixty-four years.</p>

<p><span face="Times">14</span></p>

<p><span face="Times"><a href="hadrian.html"><b>Aelius Hadrian</b></a>, a scion of Itala, born to Aelius Adrianus, a cousin of <em>princeps</em> Trajan, who came
from Adria, the town in the Picenum area which also gave the name to the Adriatic Sea, ruled
twenty-two years.  2.  He was quite considerably learned in literature and was called by many
"Greekling."  He devoured the pursuits and customs of the Athenians, having mastered not merely
rhetoric, but other disciplines, too, the science of singing, of playing the harp, and of medicine, a
musician, geometrician, painter, <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[150]</strong></span> and a sculptor from bronze or marble who approximated
Polycletus and Euphranoras.  Indeed, like those things in a way, he, too, was refined, so that
human affairs hardly ever seem to have experienced anything finer.  3.  With a power of memory
beyond that which is believable for anyone, he was able to review by their names places, affairs,
troops, and even those absent.  4.  He was of immense industry, inasmuch as he made a circuit of
all the provinces on foot, outstripping the accompanying retinue, while he revived all towns and
increased the orders.  5.  For indeed, on the example of the military legions, he had mustered into
cohorts workmen, stone-masons, architects, and, of men for the building and beautifying of walls,
every sort.  6.  He was diverse, manifold, and multiform; as if a born arbiter with respect to vices
and virtues, by some artifice he controlled intellectual impulse.  He adroitly concealed a mind
envious, melancholy, hedonistic, and excessive with respect to his own ostentation; he simulated
restraint, affability, clemency, and conversely disguised the ardor for fame with which he burned. 
7.  With respect to questioning and likewise to answering in earnest, in jest, or in invective, he was
very skillful; he returned verse to verse, speech to the speaker, so you might actually believe that
he had given advance thought to everything.  8.  His wife, Sabina, while she was nearly being
incapacitated by servile affronts, was driven to a voluntary death.  She used to say openly that,
because she had judged his character inhuman, she had taken pains lest, to the bane of the human
race, she become pregnant by him.  9.  Overcome by a subcutaneous disease which he had long
endured placidly, burning and impatient with pain, he destroyed many from the senate.  10.  Since
peace was procured from many kings by means of tributes, he used to say that he had obtained
more by leisure than others had by arms.  11.  Certainly he organized the public and palatine
offices, though not those of the military, in the <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[151]</strong></span> form which, with a few things changed by
Constantine, persists today.  12.  He lived sixty-two years; then he was consumed by a miserable
death, weakened by the torment of nearly all his limbs to such a degree that, beseeching his most
faithful ministers, he frequently averred that he must be killed and, lest he vent his madness on
himself, that a guard of those dearest to him be maintained.</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">15</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">The <a href="tonypis.html"><b>Antonius</b></a> called Fulvius or Boionius, afterward also given the cognomen Pius, ruled twenty-three years.  2.  Adopted as a son by Hadrian, whose son-in-law he had been, he was of such great
goodness in the principate that he doubtless lived without a model, although his own age will have
compared him to Numa, since by his authority alone, with no war, he ruled the orb of the earth for
twenty-three years, with all legions, nations, and peoples together fearing and loving him so much
that they regarded him as a parent or patron more than a <em>dominus</em> or <em>imperator</em>, and all, wishing in
the fashion of the propitious heavenly ones judgment about controversies among themselves,
called upon him.  4.  Indeed, even Indians, Bactrians, and Hyrcanians sent legations when the
justness of so great an <em>imperator </em>became known, a justness which he adorned with a serious,
handsome countenance, long of limb, suitably robust.  5.  Before he emerged to be saluted, he
partook of a little bread, lest, with his strength consumed as a result of the blood around his heart
being cold, he be interrupted and too little meet the needs of the business of state, which he used
to pursue with, to outward appearance, the unbelievable diligence of the best <em>paterfamilias</em>.  6. 
He lacked an appetite for glory and ostentation, and was so mild that he commented to the senate,
which was pursuing men who had plotted against him, that men desirous of evil must not be
<span class="text-2xl"><strong>[152]</strong></span> investigated in his actual presence, lest, if many should be discovered, the extent to which
he was in odium become apparent.  7.  Accordingly, it was at Lorii, his country-estate, twelve
thousand paces from the city, that he was consumed by a fever a few days after twenty-three years
of <em>imperium</em>.  8.  In his honor were decreed temples, priests, and countless other things.  9. 
Moreover, he was so gentle that when, through suspicion of a shortage of grain, he was being
pelted with stones by the Roman commons, after the supply had been exposed to view, he
preferred to placate rather than punish the sedition.</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">16</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">Marcus Aurelius Antonius ruled eighteen years.  2.  He showed himself to be of all virtues and of
celestial character, and was thrust before public calamities like a defender.  For indeed, if he had
not been born to those times, surely, as if with one fall, all of the Roman state would have
collapsed.  3.  Since there was never rest from arms, and wars were raging through all Oriens,
Illyricum, Italy, and Gallia, and there were earthquakes not without the destruction of cities,
inundations of rivers, numerous plagues, species of locusts which infested fields, there is almost
nothing by which mortals are accustomed to be vexed with the most serious difficulties that is able
to be described which did not rage while he was ruling.  4.  I believe that it has been bestowed by
divine providence that, when the law of the universe or nature produces <span class="text-2xl"><strong> </strong></span> or something else
unknown to men, they are appeased by the counsels of honest men as by the remedies of medicine. 
5.  With a new kind of benevolence, he admitted his own kinsmen, Lucius Annius Verus, to a
share of <em>imperium</em>.  This is the Verus who, while journeying between Altinum and Concordia,
died, in the eleventh year of <em>imperium</em>, as a result of a surge of blood, a disorder which the Greeks
call </span><img src="/aacugr.gif"><img src="/pgr.gif"><img src="/oacugr.gif"><img src="/pgr.gif"><img src="/lgr.gif"><img src="/eegr.gif"><img src="/xgr.gif"><img src="/igr.gif"><img src="/sfgr.gif"> [apoplexy].  6.  He was a poet, mostly of tragedies, studious, of a rugged and
lascivious character. <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[153]</strong></span>  7.  After his demise, Marcus Antoninus controlled the state alone. 
From the beginning of his life, he was extremely placid, so much so that from infancy he changed
his expression neither from joy nor sorrow.  Of philosophy and Greek literature he was a student
<strong>&lt;</strong>most expert<strong>&gt;</strong>.  8.  He allowed more illustrious men and his ministers alike to host banquets in the
same splendor as did he himself.  9.  When, with the treasury exhausted, he did not have the funds
which he applied to the soldiers and did not wish to inflict anything on the provincials or senate,
he removed by a confiscation made in the Forum of Trajan material of regal splendor, golden
vases, crystalline and murrine goblets, and his own wife's silken and golden apparel, numerous
ornaments of gems, and through two continuous months an auction was held and much gold was
collected.  10.  After a victory, however, he refunded the purchase prices to buyers who wished to
return what had been bought.  11.  In his time, Cassius, seizing a tyranny, was killed.  12.  He
himself was consumed by disease at Bendobona in the fifty-ninth year of his life.  13.  When the
announcement about his death reached Rome, with the city convulsed with public lamentation, the
senate gathered in the senate house, wrapped in mourning garb, weeping.  14.  And what is
scarcely believable about Romulus, all in common consent presumed that Marcus had been
received into heaven.  In his honor temples, columns, and many other things were decreed.</p>

<p><span face="Times">17</span></p>

<p><span face="Times"><a href="commod.html"><b>Aurelius Commodus</b></a>, son of Antoninus, and himself called Antoninus, ruled thirteen years.  2. 
What he was going to become, in the very beginning, he revealed.  For when <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[154]</strong></span> he was being
advised by his father in his will not to allow the barbarians, who were now exhausted, to regain
strength, he had responded that, although negotiations could be completed over a period of time
by a live man, nothing could to be completed by a dead man.  3.  He was quite fierce with sexual
desire and greed, with cruelty, faithful to no one, and more savage toward those whom he had
exalted with most splendid honors and enormous gifts.  4.  So depraved was he that he often
battled with gladiatorial weapons in the amphitheater.  5.  Nevertheless, Marcia, of freedman
stock, prevailed on this man by her beauty and meretricious arts, and, when she had thoroughly
gained control of his mind, offered a drink of poison to him when he was emerging from the bath. 
Finally, his throat crushed by a very strong wrestling instructor who had been let loose on him, he
expired in the thirty-second year of his life.</span></p>

many wounds at the age of sixty-seven.  His head was carried about the entire city.  3.  By this
death, there perished a man who is an example of human vicissitude, who, through all types of
labor, reached the heights, to such a degree that he was called the "Pillar of Fortune."  4.  For he
was the product of a freedman father among the Ligurians on a humble estate of Lollius Getianus,
in whose prefecture it was most happily fated that he become a client, and he became a teacher of
the letters which are taught by grammarians.  He was more pleasing than beneficial, hence men
called him by the Greek name </span><img src="/KHxgr.gif"><img src="/rgr.gif"><img src="/eegr.gif"><img src="/sgr.gif"><img src="/tgr.gif"><img src="/ogr.gif"><img src="/lgr.gif"><img src="/oacugr.gif"><img src="/ggr.gif"><img src="/ogr.gif"><img src="/sfgr.gif"> ["Smooth-talk"].  5.

common man by means of his speech, his dining, and his demeanor.  6.  To him <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[155]</strong></span> in death
was decreed the name "Divine;" for his praise, there was acclaimed with repeated ovations until
voices failed: "With Pertinax in control, we lived secure, we feared no one.  To a dutiful father!
To the father of the senate!  To the father of all good men!"</p>

skilled in law, factious, reckless, eager to rule.  2.  At this time, near Antioch, <a href="pniger.html"><b>Niger Pescennius</b></a>
and, at Sabaria in Pannonia, Septimius Severus were made Augusti.  3.  By this Severus, Julianus
was led to the secret baths of the palace and, with his neck stretched out in the fashion of the

Under him <a href="albinus.html"><b>Albinus</b></a>, too, who in Gallia had made himself Caesar, was slain near Lugdunum.  3. 
Severus left as successors his own sons, Bassianus and Geta.  4.  In Britannia he extended a wall
over a distance of thirty-two thousand paces, from sea to sea.  5.  Of all the men who had lived
before him, he was the most warlike.  He was relentless in character, persevering to the end
toward everything to which he had turned his attention.  To whom he was well disposed, he
exhibited a goodwill singular and abiding.  He was thrifty when it came to his needs, lavish in
largess.  6.  Toward friends and enemies he was equally passionate, inasmuch as he enriched
Lateranus, Cilo, Anullinus, Bassus, and several others -- and with buildings worthy of note,
particular examples of which we see which are called the "House of the Parthians" and the "House
of Lateranus."  7.  To no one, in his reign, did he permit offices to be sold.  8.  He was sufficiently
educated in Latin literature, erudite in the Greek language, more at ease with Punic eloquence,
<span class="text-2xl"><strong>[156]</strong></span> inasmuch as he was born near Leptis in the province Africa.  9.  When he was unable to
endure the pain of all his limbs, especially of his feet, in place of a drug, which was being denied
him, he too avidly fell upon a meal large and of very much meat; since he was unable to digest
this, he was overcome by the indisposition and breathed his last.  10.  He lived sixty-five years. </span></p>

<p><span face="Times"><a href="caracala.html"><b>Aurelius Antonius Bassianus Caracalla</b></a>, Severus' son, was born at Lugdunum and ruled alone six
years.  2.  He was called by the name Bassianus from his maternal grandfather.  But since he had
brought very many garments from Gallia and had made ankle-length tunics and forced the urban
population to enter dressed in such clothing for the purpose of saluting him, he was from this
garment given the cognomen Caracalla.  3.  His own brother Geta he destroyed, on account of
which he was punished with madness by the railing of the Dirae, who, not without merit, are
called Furies.  From this madness he later recovered.  4.  After he viewed the body of Alexander
of Macedon, he ordered himself to be called "the Great" and "Alexander," having been drawn by
the intrigues of flatterers to the point that, with fierce expression and neck turned toward his left
shoulder (which he had noted in Alexander's face), he reached the point of conviction and
persuaded himself that he was of very similar countenance.  5.  He could not control sexual desire,
for in fact he married his own stepmother.  6.  While making a trip to Carrhae, near Edessa, he
retired to nature's obligations and was killed by a soldier who was following him as if for the
purpose of attendance.  7.  He lived almost thirty years.  His body was brought back to Rome. </span></p>

<p><strong>[157]</strong> Aurelius Antonius Varius, also called <a href="elagabal.html"><b>Heliogabalus</b></a>, son of Caracalla from a cousin,
Soemea, who had been secretly defiled, ruled two years and eight months.  2.  The grandfather of
his mother Soemea, Bassianus by name, had been a priest of Sol, whom the Phoenicians where he
was living used to call Heliogabalus, whence the infamous Heliogabalus was named.  3.  When he
had come to Rome in the accompaniment of an enormous number of soldiers and the expectation
of the senate, he contaminated himself by means of every lewdness.  He turned toward himself a
desire for debauchery which, through a defect of nature, he had not been able to attain, and
ordered that he be called by the feminine name Bassiana, instead of Bassianus.  A vestal virgin, as
if in marriage, he joined to himself, and, after self-emasculation, he dedicated himself to the Great
Mother.  4.  He made Marcellus, his own cousin, who afterward was called Alexander, Caesar.  5. 
He himself was killed in a military insurrection.  6.  His body was dragged through the streets of
the city in the fashion of the corpse of a dog, to the accompanying soldierly jesting of people
calling him a puppy-bitch of unrestrained and crazed lust.  Finally, since the narrow opening of a
sewer would hardly accommodate the body, it was dragged all the way to the Tiber and, after a
weight was attached lest it ever rise again, was tossed into the River.  7.  He lived sixteen years
and from what had transpired was called <em>Tiberinus</em> ["the Tiberine"] and <em>Tractitius</em> ["the
Dragged"].</p>

grew old in ignoble servitude.  6.  For he lived a long while, and the king of the same province

Marcomanni, he had accepted in a kind of marriage.  2.  Finally, he advanced against Aureolus. 
When, near some bridge, which is called "Aureolus" from his name, that had been seized and

<p><span face="Times">Claudius ruled one year, nine months.  2.  Many think this man was fathered by Gordian, when, as
a youth, he was being prepared by a grown woman for a wife.  This Claudius was designated
<em>imperator</em> by the decision of the dying Gallienus, to whom, stationed at Ticinum, he had, through
Gallonius Basilius, directed the imperial regalia, and, when Aureolus had been killed by his own
men, <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[161]</strong></span> by means of the legions regained, he fought against the people of the Alamanni not far
from Lake Benacus and vanquished so great a multitude that scarcely half will have survived.  3. 
In these days, <a href="victorin.html"><b>Victorinus</b></a> took the rule.  Indeed, when Claudius had learned from the Sibylline
Books, which he had ordered to be inspected, that there was no remedy for the death of the man
who stated his position first in the senate - although Pomponius Bassus, who then was the first
man, offered himself - , he did not allow the responses to be ineffectual and gave his own life to the state for a gift,
having proclaimed that none but the <em>imperator</em> held the first place of so great an order.  4. 
Inasmuch as this act was beneficial to all, the leading men dedicated to him not only the name
"Divinity" but a statue of gold near the effigy of Jupiter itself and, in the senate-house, a gold
image.  5.  His brother <a href="quintil.html"><b>Quintillus</b></a> succeeded him.  He held power a few days and was killed. </span></p>

<p><span face="Times"><a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian</b></a>, sprung from a common father - one even, as some say, a tenant farmer of Aurelius, a
very distinguished senator, between Dacia and Macedonia - , ruled five years, six months.  2. 
That man was not unlike Alexander the Great or Caesar the Dictator;  for in the space of three
years he retook the Roman world from invaders, while Alexander in thirteen years, through
immense victories, reached to India, and Gaius Caesar, in a ten-year period, subjugated the Gauls
and, for four years, contended against citizens.  In Italy, that man was victor in three battles: at
Placentia, beside the Metaurus River and the Altar of Fortuna, and, finally, at the Ticenensian
Fields.  3.  In his time, among the Dalmatians, Septimius was made <em>imperator</em> and immediately
killed by his own men.  4.  At this time, in the city Rome, the masters of the mint rebelled, who,
having been conquered, Aurelian <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[162]</strong></span> repressed with the utmost cruelty.  5.  That man first
introduced among the Romans a diadem for the head, and he used gems and gold on every item of
clothing to a degree almost unknown to Roman custom.  6.  He fortified the city with stronger,
more solid walls.  For the populace, he instituted a ration of pork.  7.  He appointed <a href="tetrici.html"><b>Tetricus</b></a>, who
had been made <em>imperator</em> by the army in Gallia, Regulator of Lucania, twitting the man with the
choice jest that to rule over some portion of Italy must be regarded more loftily than to reign
beyond the Alps.  8.  Finally, by the treachery of his own servant - who gave to certain military
men, friends of that very servant, names with notations (he deceitfully imitated his [Aurelian's]
handwriting), as though Aurelian were preparing to kill them - he was murdered at the halfway
point in the road which is between Constantinople and Heracleum.  9.  He was savage,
bloodthirsty, and ferocious at every moment -- even the murderer of his sister's son.  10.  At the
time, for seven months, there proceeded a kind of interregnum. </span></p>

Superior.  4.  At Sirmium, in the "Iron Tower," he was killed.  <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[163]</strong></span></span></p>

3.  He died near Ctesiphon by the blow of a lightning bolt.  4.  Numerian, too, his son, while he
was being carried in a litter (he had contracted a disorder of the eyes), was murdered in a plot,
with Aper, who was his father-in-law, the instigator.  5.  While his death was being hidden by a
deception until such time as Aper was able to take power, the crime was revealed by the stench of
the corpse.  6.  Then Sabinus Julianus took power and, at the Verronesian Fields, was killed by
Carinus.  7.  This Carinus defiled himself with all crimes.  He killed many innocent men for made-up offenses.  He corrupted the marriages of nobles.  He was ruinous toward his fellow pupils, too,
who, with jeering voice, teased him in the classroom.  8.  He was tortured to death chiefly by the

ruled twenty-five years.  2.  He made <a href="maxherc.html"><b>Maximian</b></a> an Augustus; Constantius and Galerius
Maximianus, with the cognomen Armentarius ["Herdsman"], he created Caesars, giving to

<p><span face="Times">5.  Diocletian actually relinquished the imperial fasces of his own accord at Nicomedia and grew
old on his private estates. <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[164]</strong></span>  6.  It was he who, when solicited by Herculius and Galerius for
the purpose of resuming control, responded in this way, as though avoiding some kind of plague:
"If you could see at Salonae the cabbages raised by our hands, you surely would never judge that
a temptation."  7.  He lived sixty-eight years, out of which he passed almost nine in a common
condition.  He was consumed, as was sufficiently clear, by voluntary death as a result of fear. 
Inasmuch as when, called by Constantine and Licinius to the celebrations of a wedding which he
was by no means well enough to attend, he had excused himself, after threatening replies were
received in which it was being proclaimed that he had favored Maxentius and was favoring
Maximian, he, regarding assassination as dishonorable, is said to have drunk poison.</span></p>

Augustus, and, in the same fashion, <a href="alexand.html"><b>Alexander</b></a> at Carthagina; and likewise <a href="valenz.html"><b>Valens</b></a> was created
<em>imperator</em>.  Their demise was as follows:</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">3.  Severus Caesar was killed by Herculius Maximian in Rome at Tres Tabernae and his ashes
were interred in the sepulchre of Gallienus, which is nine miles from the city on the Appian Way. 
4.  Galerius Maximianus, when his genitals were consumed, died.  5.  Maximian Herculius,
besieged by Constantine at Massilia, then captured, was executed in a fashion most base, with his
neck snapped by a noose.  6.  Alexander was slaughtered by Constantine's army.  7.  Maxentius,
while engaged against Constantine, hastening to enter from the side a bridge of boats constructed
a little above the Milvian Bridge, was plunged into the depth when his horse slipped; his body,
swallowed up by the weight of his armor, <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[165]</strong></span> was barely recovered.  8.  Maximinus died a
simple death at Tarsus.  9.  Valens was punished with death by Licinius.  </span></p>

<p><span face="Times">10.  As for characters, moreover, they were of this sort: Aurelius Maximian, with the cognomen
Herculius, was fierce by nature, burning with lust, stolid in his counsels, of rustic and Pannonian
stock.  For even now, not far from Sirmium, there is a spot prominent because of a palace
constructed there, where his parents once worked wage-earning jobs.  11.  He died at the age of
sixty, <em>imperator</em> for twenty years.  12.  From Eutropia, a Syrian woman, he sired Maxentius and
<a href="fausta.html"><b>Fausta</b></a>, the wife of Constantine, to whose father Constantius had given his stepdaughter,
Theodora.  13.  But Maxentius, they say, was substituted by the womanly wile of one laboring to
control a husband's affection by means of an auspice of a most felicitous fecundity which
commenced with a boy.  14.  Maxentius was dear to no one at all, not even to his father or
brother-in-law, Galerius.  15.  Galerius, moreover, although possessed of an uncultivated and
rustic justice, was praiseworthy enough, physically attractive, a skilled and fortunate warrior,
sprung from country parents, a keeper of cattle, whence for him the cognomen Armentarius
["Herdsman"].  16.  He was born and also buried in Dacia Ripensis, a place which he had called
Romulianum from the name of his mother, Romula.  17.  He insolently dared to affirm that, in the
fashion of Olympias, the mother of Alexander the Great, his mother had conceived him after she
had been embraced by a serpent.  18.  Galerius Maximinus, scion of Armentarius' sister, called by
the name Daca, to be sure, before <em>imperium</em>, was a Caesar for four years, then an Augustus in
Oriens for three -- in birth, indeed, and in station a shepherd, yet a supporter of every very
learned man and of literature, quiet by nature, too fond of wine.  19.  Drunk with which, with his
mind corrupted, he used to command certain harsh measures; but when he repented what had been
done, in a continent and sober time, what he had enjoined, he ordered deferred.  20.  Alexander
was a Phrygian in origin, inferior in the face of hardship through the fault of old age.  <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[166]</strong></span></span></p>

<p><span face="Times">41</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">With all these men out of the way, the rights of <em>imperium</em> fell to Constantine and Licinius.  2. 
<a href="conniei.html"><b>Constantine</b></a>, son of <em>imperator</em> Constantius and <a href="helena.html"><b>Helena</b></a>, ruled thirty years.  While a young man
being held as a hostage by Galerius in the city of Rome on the pretence of his religion, he took
flight and, for the purpose of frustrating his pursuers, wherever his journey had brought him, he
destroyed the public transports, and reached his father in Britain; and by chance, in those very
days in the same place, ultimate destiny was pressing on his parent, Constantius.  3.  With him
dead, as all who were present -- but especially Crocus, King of the Alamanni, who had
accompanied Constantius for the sake of support -- were urging him on, he took<em> imperium</em>.  4. 
To Licinius, who was summoned to Mediolanum, he wed his own sister <a href="consis.html"><b>Constantia</b></a>; and his own
son, Crispus by name, born by Minervina, a concubine, and likewise Constantinus, born in those
same days at the city Arlate, and Licinianus, son of Licinius, about twenty months old, he made
Caesars.  5.  But, indeed, as <em>imperia</em> preserve concord with difficulty, a rift arose between Licinius
and Constantine; and first, near Cibalae, beside a lake named Hiulca, when Constantine burst into
Licinus' camps by night, Licinius sought escape and, by a swift flight, reached Byzantium.  6. 
There <a href="martinia.html"><b>Martinianus</b></a>, Master of Offices, he made a Caesar.  7.  Then Constantine, stronger in battle
in Bithynia, pledged through the wife to confer regal garb upon Licinius, his safety having been
guaranteed.  Then, after he had been sent to Thessalonica, a little later he ordered him and
Martinianus slaughtered.  8.  Licinius died after about fourteen years of <em>dominatio</em>, and near the
sixtieth year of his life: through a love of avarice he was the worst of all men and not a stranger to
sexual debauchery, harsh indeed, immoderately impatient, hostile toward literature, which, as a
result of his boundless <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[167]</strong></span> ignorance, he used to call a poison and a public pestilence, especially
forensic endeavor.  9.  Obviously he was sufficiently salutary to farmers and country folk, because
he had sprung from and had been raised from that group, and a most strict guardian of the military
according to the institutes of our forefathers.  10.  He was a vehement suppressor of all eunuchs
and courtiers, calling them worms and vermin of the palace.  11.  But Constantine, when mastery
of the entire Roman empire had been obtained through the wondrous good fortune of his wars,
with his wife, Fausta, inciting him, so men think, ordered his son <a href="crispus.html"><b>Crispus</b></a> put to death.  12.  Then,
when his mother, Helena, as a result of excessive grief for her grandson, chastised him, he killed
his own wife, Fausta, who was thrown into hot baths.  13.  He was, to be sure, too desirous of
praise, as is able to be ascertained.  On account of the legends inscribed on many structures, he
was accustomed to call Trajan "Wall Plant."  He built a bridge over the Danube.  14.  The royal
garb he adorned with gems, and his head, at all times, with a diadem.  Nevertheless, he was most
agreeable in many matters: by means of laws most severe he checked malicious prosecutions; he
nurtured the fine arts, especially studies of literature; he himself read, wrote, reflected, and listened
to legations and the complaints of the provinces.  15.  And when, with his children and his
brother's son, <a href="dalmatiu.html"><b>Delmatius</b></a>, confirmed as Caesars, he had lived sixty-three years, half of which thus,
so that thirteen he alone ruled, he was consumed by disease.  16.  He was a mocker rather than a
flatterer.  From this he was called after Trachala in the folktale, for ten years a most excellent man,
for the following second ten a brigand, for the last, on account of his unrestrained prodigality, a
ward irresponsible for his own actions.  17.  His body was buried in Byzantium, called
Constantinople.  18.  With him dead, Delmatius was put to death by the violence of the troops. </span></p>

<p><span face="Times">19.  Thus <em>dominatio</em> of the Roman world was returned to three men, <a href="conii.html"><b>Constantinus</b></a>, <a href="constaii.html"><b>Constantius</b></a>,
and <a href="consi.html"><b>Constans,</b></a> the sons <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[168]</strong></span> of Constantine.  20.  These individually held these areas as their
realms: Constantinus the Younger, everything beyond the Alps; Constantius, from the Strait of the
Propontis, Asia, and Oriens; Constans, Illyricum and Italy and Africa;  Delmatius, Thrace and
Macedonia and Achaea;  <a href="hanna.html"><b>Hannibalianus</b></a>, brother of Delmatius Caesar, Armenia and neighboring,
allied nations.  </span></p>

<p><span face="Times">21.  However, on account of the legal right to Italy and Africa, Constantinus and Constans
immediately disagreed.  When Constantinus, reckless and horribly intoxicated, in a display of
highway robbery, rushed into territories not his own, he was slain and thrown into a river, the
name for which is Alsa, not far from Aquileia.  22.  But while Constans, because of a desire of
hunting, was roaming through forests and woodland pastures, some soldiers, with Chrestius,
Marcellinus, and also <a href="magnent.html"><b>Magnentius</b></a> the instigators, conspired toward his murder.  As soon as the
day of carrying out the business was resolved, Marcellinus, feigning the birth of a son, invited
many men to dinner.  And so, late in the night, while a drinking party was being celebrated, he
withdrew as if to relieve himself as is normal, and assumed the revered attire.  23.  When this
action was discovered, Constans attempted to flee to Helena, a city close to the Pyrenees, and by
Gaiso, who had been dispatched with picked men, he was killed in the thirteenth year of his reign
as an Augustus (for he had been a Caesar for a three-year period), at the age of twenty-seven.  24. 
Disabled in the feet and hands through a malady of the joints, he was fortunate in temperateness of
climate, in an abundance of harvests, and in no terror from barbarians, things which would have
been still greater indeed, if he had promoted governors<em> </em>of provinces not for a price, but on the
basis of judgment.  25.  When his death became known, <a href="vetran.html"><b>Vetranio</b></a>, Master of Soldiers, seized
<em>imperium</em> in Pannonia at Mursia; not many days after, Constantius desposed him from power,
granting to him not only a long life, but also a retirement full of pleasures.  He was, moreover, a
most simpleminded man, verging on stupidity.  <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[169]</strong></span></span></p>

<p><span face="Times">42</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">Constantius proclaimed Caesar <a href="gallus.html"><b>Gallus</b></a>, the son of his father's brother, marrying to him his sister,
<a href="constan.html"><b>Constantia</b></a>.  2.  Magnentius, too, made <a href="magnent.html"><b>Decentius</b></a>, his brother, Caesar beyond the Alps.  3.  In
these days, at Rome, <a href="nepot.html"><b>Nepotianus</b></a>, son of <a href="sibling.html"><b>Eutropia</b></a>, Constantine's sister, with those who had been
destroyed driving him on, took the name Augustus; him Magnentius crushed in twenty-eight days. 
4.  At this time, Constantius did battle with Magnentius at Mursa and was victorious.  In this
battle, hardly anywhere was Roman might more fully consumed and the fortune of the whole
empire dashed.  5.  Then, when Magnentius had removed himself toward Italy, near Ticinum he
scattered many who were recklessly and, as is customary in victory, too boldly pursuing him.  6. 
Not much later, cornered near Lugdunum, he breathed his last in the forty-second month of
<em>imperium</em> and in about the fiftieth year of his life, his side pierced with a sword secretly supplied,
assisting the blow by pushing against a wall -- as he was of immense size -- , spewing blood from
the wound, his nostrils, and mouth.  7.  He sprang from barbarian parents, who inhabited Gallia;
he was inclined toward the study of reading, sharp of tongue, of a haughty spirit, and cowardly
beyond measure; a master, nevertheless, for concealing terror under a pretext of boldness.  8. 
When his death was heard of, Decentius ended his life with a noose made of a cloth swathe.  9. 
At this time, Gallus Caesar was killed by Constantius.  He ruled four years.  10.  <a href="silvanus.html"><b>Silvanus</b></a> was
made <em>imperator</em> and, on the twenty-eighth day of <em>imperium</em>, was destroyed.  He was by nature
most charming.  11.  Although the scion of a barbarian father, he was nevertheless, as a result of
Roman training, sufficiently cultivated and patient.</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">12.  Constantius took to himself with the rank of Caesar Claudius Julian, Gallus' brother, almost
twenty-three years old.  13.  In the Argentoratensian Fields in Gallia, he, with a few troops,
destroyed an innumerable army of enemies.  14.  The <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[170]</strong></span> heaps were standing like mountains,
the blood was flowing in the fashion of rivers; a king, noble Nodomarius, was captured; the entire
aristocracy was routed; the frontier of Roman property was restored; and afterward, doing battle
with the Alamanni, he captured their most powerful king, Badomarius.  15.  He was proclaimed
Augustus by the Gallic troops.  16.  Through legations, Constantius urged him to return to his
original status and title.  Julian, in a rather mild, secret correspondence, replied that he would
serve far more dutifully under the title of a lofty <em>imperium</em>.  17.  As a result of these things,
Constantius burned more and more with outrage and, as he was unable to endure the like, with a
sharp fever which excessive indignation increased by sleepless nights, perished in the foothills of
Mount Taurus near Mopsocrene in the forty-fourth year of age and in the thirty-ninth of
<em>imperium</em>, but in his twenty-fourth as an Augustus: eight alone, sixteen with his brothers and
Magnentius, fifteen as a Caesar.  18.  He was lucky in civil wars, lamentable in foreign; an
amazing artist with arrows, very abstinent from food, drink, and sleep, able to endure labor, a
lover of eloquence, which, since, through slowness of mind, he was unable to attain, he used to
envy in others.  19.  He was addicted to the love of eunuchs, courtiers, and wives, by whom -
satisfied by no deviant or unlawful pleasure - he used to be polluted.  20.  But from wives, many
whom he obtained, he especially delighted in <a href="eusebia.html"><b>Eusebia</b></a>, who was indeed elegant, but, through
Adamantiae and Gorgoniae and other dangerous abettors, harmful of her husband's reputation,
contrary to what is customary for more upright females whose precepts often aid their husbands. 
21.  For, as I pass over others, it is incredible to relate how much Pompeia Plotina increased the
glory of Trajan: when his <em>procuratores</em> were disrupting the provinces with false accusations to the
extent that one of them was said to have greeted a certain wealthy fellow thus, "How did you get
so much?"; another, "Where did you get so much?"; a third, "Give me what you've got," she
admonished her husband and, <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[171]</strong></span> reproaching him because he was so unconcerned with his
reputation, returned so much that afterward he spurned unjust exactions and called the fisc the
spleen, because, as it increased, the remaining muscles and limbs dwindled.  </span></p>

<p><span face="Times">43</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">Then <a href="julian.html"><b>Julian</b></a>, the care of the Roman world having been returned to one man, himself, excessively
desirous of glory, marched toward Persia.  2.  There, led by a certain deserter into an ambush,
when the Parthians were pressing upon him from different directions, he rushed from a just-established camp with a hastily snatched shield.  3.  And when, with unthinking ardor, he
attempted to order the ranks for battle, he was struck with a pike by a single man, from the enemy
and, in fact, in flight.  4.  And borne back to his tent and having emerged once again to encourage
his men, gradually drained of blood, he died at just about midnight, having said beforehand, when
consulted about <em>imperium</em>, that he recommended no one, lest, as is customary in a multitude with
discrepant inclinations, <span class="text-2xl"><strong> </strong></span> he produce danger for a friend from envy and for the state as a result of
the discord of the army.  5.  There had been in him immense knowledge of literature and of affairs,
he had equaled the philosophers and the wisest of the Greeks.  6.  He was very disposed toward
exercise of the body, in which he was strong indeed, but he was short.  7.  A disregard of due
measure in certain matters diminished these things.  His desire of praise was excessive; his worship
of the gods superstitious; he was more daring than befits an <em>imperator</em>, by whom personal safety
always must be maintained for the security of all, <strong>&lt;</strong>but<strong>&gt;</strong> in war most of all.  8.  The desire of glory
had so violently overwhelmed him that neither by the movement of the earth nor by very
numerous presages through which he was being forbidden to attack Persia was he led to put an
end to his ardor, and not even a masssive sphere observed by night to fall from heaven before the
day of battle kept him cautious.  </span></p>

<p><span face="Times">44</span></p>

<p><span face="Times"><a href="jovian.html"><b>Jovian</b></a>, child of Varronianus, his father, an inhabitant of the land of <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[172]</strong></span> Singido in the province
Pannonia, ruled eight months.  2.  His father, when he had lost many children, was commanded in
a dream to call Jovian him who, with his wife's time to give birth now at hand, was going to be
born.  3.  He was extraordinary in body, pleasant in spirit, studious of literature.  4.  Hastening
from Persia to Constantinople in the middle of a harsh winter, he died suddenly from repletion of
the stomach, made more grievous by the plaster of a new building, in about his fortieth year.  </span></p>

<p><span face="Times">45</span></p>

<p><span face="Times"><a href="vali.html"><b>Valentinian</b></a> ruled ten years less ten days.  2.  His father, Gratianus, sprung from modest stock near
Cibalis, was called Funarius ["Trace-horse"] because five soldiers were unable to wrest a slave-market rope from him while he was carrying it.  3.  Admitted into the army on the basis of this
merit, he rose all the way to the power of the praetorian prefecture; on account of his favor among
the soldiers, <em>imperium</em> was offered to a resistant Valentinian.  4.  He admitted <a href="valens.html"><b>Valens</b></a>, his own
brother, into <em>imperium</em> as a partner to himself and, at length, at the behest of his mother-in-law
and wife, created as Augustus <a href="gratian.html"><b>Gratian</b></a>, his son, who was not yet fully mature.  5.  Valentinian was
seemly in countenance, clever in character, serious in mind, most cultivated in conversation,
although a man of few words, stern, vehement, tainted by faults, and most of all that of greed, of
which he was a keen lover, and, in these things which I shall mention, very close to Hadrian: he
was a most elegant painter, had a most powerful memory, reflected upon new weapons, fashioned
images by means of wax or clay, made prudent use of places, times, and conversation; and so, in
order to conclude briefly, if it had been permitted that he, who had entrusted himself as if to men
most reliable and most prudent, had lacked men inimical to him, or that he had employed
praiseworthy and erudite advisors, without doubt, he would have shone forth, a perfect <em>princeps</em>. 
<span class="text-2xl"><strong>[173]</strong></span> 7.  In his time, <a href="firmus.html"><b>Firmus</b></a>, usurping rule in Mauretania, was destroyed.  8.  Valentinian,
responding at Bergentio to a legation of Quadi, expired as the result of a hemorrhage, his voice
lost, his senses intact, in the fifty-fifth year of age.  9.  Many, indeed, said that this had happened
because of overeating and satiety.  10.  And so, with him dead, <a href="valenii.html"><b>Valentinianus</b></a>, now in his fourth
year, with Equitius as promoter and Merobaudes, was produced from nearby, where he had been
with his mother, and made <em>imperator</em>.  </span></p>

<p><span face="Times">46</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">Valens, in company with his brother Valentinian, about whom we have spoken, ruled thirteen
years, five months.  2.  This Valens, when a lamentable war with the Goths was entered into, was
carried, wounded by arrows, to a most humble dwelling; there, with Goths arriving and a fire set
underneath, he was consumed by the blaze.  3.  In him, these things demanded approbation: he
was a fine advocate for owners of property; he seldom shifted judges; he was loyal to friends; he
became angry without injury or danger to anyone; he was quite cautious, to be sure.  4.  In his
times, <a href="procopis.html"><b>Procopius</b></a>, usurping a tyranny, was destroyed.  </span></p>

<p><span face="Times">47</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">Gratian, a native of Sirmium, ruled with his father, Valentinian, eight years, eighty-five days; with
his uncle and brother, three years; with the same brother and <a href="theo1.html"><b>Theodosius</b></a>, four; and with <a href="arcadius.html"><b>Arcadius</b></a>
added to all these, six months.  2.  At Argentaria, a city in Gallia, he killed thirty thousand
Alamanni in battle.  3.  And when he had recognized that extreme danger threatened the Roman
name as a result of the Goths and Taifali and also, more terrible than total annihilation, the Huns
and Alans controlling Thrace and Dacia as though foreign lands, to the applause of all, he
committed a third of the <em>imperium</em> to Theodosius, a year under thirty, who was summoned from
Hispania.  4. Moreover, this Gratian was not of modest learning in literature: he composed <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[174]</strong></span>
poetry; he spoke elegantly; he explicated debates in the fashion of rhetors; both night and day he
did nothing but practice archery, and he thought that to hit the mark was a thing of supreme
pleasure and divine skill.  5.  He was sparing of food and sleep, and a conqueror of wine and
sexual desire; and he would have been fitted with all good qualities, if he had attended to
comprehending the science of ruling the state, from which he was almost a stranger not only by
inclination but also by practice.  6.  For he aroused the hatred of the troops against himself when
he neglected the army and preferred to the venerable Roman soldier a few from the Alans whom
he had arrogated to himself by an immense payment of gold, and with the retinue of barbarians he
had almost even begun to have friendship <span class="text-2xl"><strong>*</strong></span> to the degree that he sometimes made a journey in the
same attire.  7.  At this time, when <a href="madmax.html"><b>Maximus</b></a> had seized a tyranny in Britain and had crossed over
into Gallia, he was received by legions hostile to Gratian, put Gratian to flight, and, without delay,
killed him.  He lived XXIX years.</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">48</span></p>

<p><span face="Times">Theodosius, whose father was Honorius and whose mother was Thermantia, tracing his origin
from the <em>princeps</em> Trajan, was made <em>imperator</em> by Gratian Augustus at Sirmium and reigned
seventeen years.  2.  They say that his parents, having been advised in a dream, bestowed upon
him a name that in Latin we understand to mean "Given by God."  3.  Also, with regard to this
oracle, it was divulged in Asia that the name of the man who would succeed Valens would begin
with the Greek letters </span><span face="Attika">Y</span><span face="Times"> and </span><span face="Attika">E </span><span face="Times">and </span><span face="Attika">O </span><span face="Times">and </span><span face="Attika">D</span><span face="Times">.  4.  Through the close relationship of the beginning
of his name, a Theodorus was deceived and, when he presumed that the throne ought to be his,
paid the penalties of wicked desire.  5.  Theodosius, moreover, was an expander and distinguished
defender of the state.  For in diverse battles he defeated the Huns and Goths who had devastated it
under Valens.  Also, when petitioned by the Persians, he concluded a peace.  6.  In addition, at
Aquileia he killed Maximus the tyrant, who had murdered Gratian and had taken control of Gallia,
<span class="text-2xl"><strong>[175]</strong></span> and executed his son <a href="flavvict.html"><b>Victor</b></a>, who had been made Augustus while still an infant.  7.  He also
conquered <a href="eugene.html"><b>Eugenius</b></a> the tyrant and Arbogastes, killing ten thousand of their troops.  For after he
destroyed Valentinianus at Vienna, relying on Arbogastes' might, he had usurped control; but he
soon lost <em>imperium</em>, along with his life.  </span></p>

<p><span face="Times">8.  Furthermore, many writings of the ancients and pictures inform us that Theodosius resembled
Trajan in his manners and physique: thus, his stature was eminent, his limbs the same, likewise his
hair and his mouth, except that his legs were somewhat weak for marching and his eyes were not
as glowing (I am not sure whether he was as kind, or had as much of a beard, or walked with so
dignified a gait).  9.  But his intellect was certainly similar, to such a degree that there is nothing
able to be said which does not seem to be transferred to that man from books.  He was merciful,
compassionate, open, thinking to distinguish himself from others by dress alone; he was respectful
toward all men, but more profusely toward the good; he prized simple characters equally,
accomplished but harmless he admired; he bestowed great things with great spirit; he loved to
reward citizens or those whom he knew through private companionship with honors, wealth, and
other favors; he had especially esteemed the services of those toward himself and his father in
hopeless adversity.  10.  Nevertheless, he so detested those things by which Trajan was
bespattered -- intoxication, to be sure, and desire of the triumph -- that he did not initiate wars,
but found them in existence, and forbade by law lascivious occupations and that female lutists be
employed in revelries, attributing so much to propriety and continence that he barred marriages of
first cousins just as if they were those of sisters.  11.  If we should compare him to the exceedingly
polished, he was moderately learned; he was obviously intelligent and very keen with regard to
becoming acquainted with the deeds of our ancestors.  12.  From these he never ceased to censure
the acts of which he read that were haughty, cruel, and inimical to liberty, as Cinna, Marius, <span class="text-2xl"><strong>[176]</strong></span>
and Sulla, and everyone holding <em>dominatio</em>, but especially the treacherous and ungrateful.  13.  He
was, of course, enraged by unbecoming acts, but was quickly placated, because of which harsh
measures were sometimes mollified as the result of a slight delay.  14.  And he possessed by
nature what Augustus possessed from a teacher of philosophy.  15.  He it was who, when he had
seen that he was easily disturbed, advised him, lest he order something harsh, to recite by memory
the twenty-four Greek letters when he became angry, so that passion, which is momentary, would,
with the mind turned to something else, lessen with the interposition of a little time. </span></p>

<p><span face="Times">16.  What is of rare virtue, he was doubtless better after his regal power increased with the years,
and better by far after his victory in civil war.  17.  For he was very solicitous both to attend to the
care of the grain supply and to return to many from his own the great mass of gold and silver
borne off and expended by the tyrant, while the benign of the <em>principes</em> were, in fact, almost
accustomed to concede denuded farms and devastated estates.  18.  Now it is those less important
and, as is said, intrapalace matters, which, indeed, because they are secret, greatly attract to
themselves the eyes and ears of men of inquisitive nature: he nurtured his paternal uncle like a
parent; he held the children of his deceased brother and sister as his own, having embraced
cognates and affines in the spirit of a parent; he presented elegant and delightful, nevertheless
inexpensive, entertainment; he mixed his conversations according to persons, his endeavors
according to their ranks, light speech with weighty; he was a pleasing father, an agreeable
husband.  19.  He exercised neither for the purpose of pleasure nor stamina; when there was
leisure, he restored his spirit by means of long walks and he controlled his health through
moderation of eating; and so he departed in peace at Mediolanum, in the course of his fiftieth year
in mortal affairs, bequeathing to his two sons, that is, to Arcadius and <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius</b></a>, two states
quiescent.  20.  In the same year, his body was borne to Constantinople and interred.</span></p>
