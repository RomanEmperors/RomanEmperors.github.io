<div  class="page"><p>Sophia, wife of <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin II (565-578)</b></a>, was the niece of <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a>, presumably being the daughter of
one of <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora's</b></a> sisters.<a href="#N_1_"><b>[[1]]</b></a> Since we hear nothing of the career of <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora's</b></a> younger sister
Anastasia, Sophia may well have been the daughter of Comito, the elder sister, who in 528 made a
prestigious marriage with <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> general Sittas.<a href="#N_2_"><b>[[2]]</b></a> True to her policy of promoting the interests
of her family whenever possible, <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a> ensured that her niece Sophia was married to
<a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> nephew <a href="justinii.html">Justin</a>, the son of <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> sister Vigilantia, and it was perhaps not
coincidental that it was <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin</b></a> and Sophia who succeeded <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> at his death on November 14,
565, for during her lifetime <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a> 
clearly favoured as <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> successor
<a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin</b></a> over his cousin, the son of Germanus and also
named Justin.  Sophia was a worthy successor to her aunt. From the time of her accession, she
emerges as a powerful and influential empress, who believed that she had inherited the right to
power. According to the monophysite bishop, John of Ephesus, Sophia attributed her husband's
madness to his failure to appreciate her status sufficiently: "The kingdom came through me, and it
has come back to me: and as for him, he is chastised, and has fallen into this trial on my account,
because he did not value me sufficiently, and vexed me."<a href="#N_3_"><b>[[3]]</b></a> Such was the force of her personality
that, even as empress-consort, her role in government was publicly recognised, unlike that of her
aunt <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a>, while the fact that her husband was to suffer from dementia resulted in Sophia's
having unparalleled influence over both government and the succession.</p><p>Sources for the reign of <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin II</b></a> and Sophia are in general unfavourable, not least because the
imperial couple instituted a persecution of monophysites throughout the empire (monophysites
were considered heretics, in as much as they believed that Christ had only one nature, and that
divine). John of Ephesus, one of our main sources, was himself imprisoned as part of their
campaign to impose orthodoxy,<a href="#N_4_"><b>[[4]]</b></a> and his portrait of Sophia shows an empress who was both
arrogant and domineering. His unflattering picture of the imperial pair is supplemented by that of
Evagrius, who stresses avarice as a characteristic feature of the reign.<a href="#N_5_"><b>[[5]]</b></a> In contrast the lengthy
laudatory poem of Corippus, <i>In laudem Iustini Minoris (In Praise of Justin the Younger)</i> written 
shortly after their accession, was specifically intended to flatter the couple, and pays marked
reverence to Sophia. Indeed, it appears from Corippus that Sophia herself was his source for
events which took place behind the scenes.<a href="#N_6_"><b>[[6]]</b></a></p><p>On her accession Sophia already had a married daughter, Arabia, and it can be assumed that
Sophia herself was therefore born no later than 535 and must have been married and Arabia born
by 550. In fact, it is probable that her marriage took place before <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora's</b></a> death in June 548,
and she was probably born c. 530. According to Theophanes, she had also had a son, Justus, who
had died prior to 565.<a href="#N_7_"><b>[[7]]</b></a> Under <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a>, <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin</b></a> had held the prestigious post of <i>curopalates</i>, the
major-domo of the imperial palace responsible for its organisation and construction work, and
Arabia's husband, Badouarios, was to succeed <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin</b></a> in this influential position.<a href="#N_8_"><b>[[8]]</b></a> Sophia appears
to have played an important part in helping to orchestrate <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin's</b></a> accession to the throne, for
<a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> had nominated no successor. <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin</b></a> had the advantage over his cousin of being on the
spot, and with the senate's backing he was secretely acclaimed in the palace on 14 November 565
before his accession was proclaimed to the people and factions.<a href="#N_9_"><b>[[9]]</b></a> The acclamations of the people
treated the couple as a pair, the "two lights of the world", according to Corippus,<a href="#N_10_"><b>[[10]]</b></a> and Sophia
appears to have been the dominant partner at their accession. In Corippus' poem, the first three
books of which were probably written in 566, Sophia is invoked as queen of all, who protects the
world ("summa regens Sapientia protegis orbem"), the appeal to her preceding one to the
Theotokos,  the "Mother of God", and as "divine and propitious empress, holy and venerable
name, immortal good, the Wisdom (Sapientia) of our tongue".<a href="#N_11_"><b>[[11]]</b></a> Sophia in Greek means "wisdom"
and Corippus frequently translates her name as "Sapientia", the Latin equivalent. In <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin's</b></a>
accession speech made in the palace, as presented by Corippus, she is linked indelibly with him:
"this holy head Wisdom (ie, Sophia) is made the consort, to rule with me together in honour the
world entrusted to me, sitting in the same place".<a href="#N_12_"><b>[[12]]</b></a> Sophia is shown as having organised the
funerary arrangements at <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> death and as having woven a sumptuous shroud for him,
decorated with scenes of triumph from his reign.<a href="#N_13_"><b>[[13]]</b></a> Corippus even pretends that <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> had
prophetically named St Sophia in her honour, though the church had had this name since its
original foundation, and points out that <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a> was ruling at the time the church was rebuilt,
thus giving Sophia a dynastic claim to the throne as well as <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin</b></a>.<a href="#N_14_">[[14]]</a></p><p><a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin's</b></a> accession was supposedly predicted by both the patriarch of the time, John of Sirimis
(otherwise known as John Scholastikos), and the ex-patriarch Eutychius, who had been exiled by
<a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> in 565.<a href="#N_15_"><b>[[15]]</b></a> Nevertheless, <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin</b></a> had a serious rival in his second cousin, also called Justin,
the son of <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> cousin Germanus. Sophia ensured that this rival was soon dispatched.
According to Evagrius, he was initially welcomed in Constantinople, but was soon removed to
Alexandria and murdered; the Spanish chronicler John of Biclar, who was in Constantinople at the
time, ascribes this decision specifically to Sophia. In Evagrius' account, the imperial couple
are shown as sending for the head and kicking it to indulge their "boiling spite".<a href="#N_16_"><b>[[16]]</b></a> In 568 the
veteran general Narses was recalled from Italy, and Sophia is said to have had a hand in this
decision as well. Paul the Deacon records that she was said to have sent Narses the message that
she would give him the job of assigning the duties of weaving to the girls in the <i>gynaikonitis</i>
(women's quarters), as a task more suited to a eunuch than generalship, and that Narses was so
afraid of the empress that he dared not return to Constantinople.<a href="#N_17_"><b>[[17]]</b></a>  Sophia was clearly a <i>femme
formidable</i> who had the full confidence of her husband, and it is not surprising that <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin</b></a> crowned
her Augusta, an honour which had been denied <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a>.<a href="#N_18_"><b>[[18]]</b></a></p><p>Sophia also showed a great concern with financial measures and treasury reserves. There appears
to have been general concern among financiers at the time of the couple's accession. A conspiracy
by leading senators Aitherios and Addaios in 566 may have been connected with dissatisfaction on
the part of the financial community, for Aitherios had been involved in the bankers' conspiracy of
562/3, caused by <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> demands against wealthy financiers. Decisive action was taken against
the conspiracy and the two leaders were beheaded on the grounds that they had attempted to
poison <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin</b></a>.<a href="#N_19_"><b>[[19]]</b></a> One of <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin's</b></a> first actions was to repay debts and cancel taxation arrears, as well
as repaying loans, which <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> had demanded from the wealthy, from out of his private
resources.<a href="#N_20_"><b>[[20]]</b></a>  In Theophanes's account it is Sophia who summons the bankers and money-lenders
and orders that the financial records of contracts and receipts be produced. She then reads the
receipts, hands them over to the debtors and repays the amounts owed.<a href="#N_21_"><b>[[21]]</b></a> Theophanes places this
in the wrong year, but it is clear that his source portrayed Sophia as the instigator of financial
measures after <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin's</b></a> accession. In general, and despite <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin's</b></a> distribution of largesse at his
reestablishment of the consulship (which had lapsed since 541),<a href="#N_22_"><b>[[22]]</b></a> the imperial couple's priority
was to restock the treasury, exhausted during <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> reign, though the accumulation of large
reserves was attributed to avarice on their part.<a href="#N_23_"><b>[[23]]</b></a>  Sophia was to show a deep concern with
imperial spending and treasury reserves during the reign of her protege <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius </b></a>and accused him
of denuding the treasury of money which she had taken pains to accumulate.</p><p>The keynote to Sophia's perception of her status is struck by her adoption of the official title
Aelia, the title given to empresses of the Theodosian house and their successors Verina, Ariadne
and Zenonis, and which Euphemia and <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a> had dropped. Sophia was also the first empress
whose portrait was shown on coins alongside that of the emperor, and was depicted from the first
year of <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin's</b></a> reign on the <i>folleis</i>, copper coins used in the day-to-day transactions of the empire.
Like <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin</b></a> she was shown enthroned, in full imperial dress, holding a sceptre and with a nimbus,
denoting her imperial status; on coins minted at Carthage her name was even added to that of
Justin.<a href="#N_24_"><b>[[24]]</b></a> Other Byzantine empresses had 
appeared on the coinage -- notably <a href="helena.html"><b>Helena</b></a>, <a href="fausta.html"><b>Fausta</b></a>, Pulcheria and
<a href="eudox.html"><b>Licinia Eudoxia</b></a> -- but Sophia's collegial status, vis-à-vis <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin</b></a>, was shown by her appearance
alongside him as emperor with equally royal insignia. <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin's </b></a>dependence on Sophia, and his
desire to flatter her, is also shown by the fact that he rebuilt the harbour of Julian and named it
after her (the Sophia), and called two new palaces after his wife, the Sophiae near the harbour of
Julian, built before their accession, and the Sophianae across the Bosporus, probably built shortly
afterwards.<a href="#N_25_"><b>[[25]]</b></a> Theophanes also claims that <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin</b></a> restored the public bath of the Taurus and named
it Sophianae after Sophia.<a href="#N_26_"><b>[[26]]</b></a> The couple were also depicted in statuary in the capital; John of
Ephesus mentions two bronze statues of Justin and Sophia,<a href="#N_27_"><b>[[27]]</b></a> while two groups of statues featured
Sophia with, in one case, <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin</b></a>, Arabia and Vigilantia, <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin's</b></a> mother, and in the other, Arabia
and Sophia's niece Helena.<a href="#N_28_"><b>[[28]]</b></a> The couple maintained a high profile in the capital through their
building program, and epigrams celebrating their dedications speak of <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin</b></a> and Sophia as a
pair,<a href="#N_29_"><b>[[29]]</b></a> while they also promoted their philanthropic image by the construction and repair of many
of the capital's churches and commissioned a new throne-room in the palace, known as the
<i>Chrysotriklinos</i>, or golden chamber.<a href="#N_30_"><b>[[30]]</b></a></p><p><a href="justin.html"><b>Justin</b></a> and Sophia also took pains to broadcast their collegiality and religious orthodoxy overseas,
by presenting a relic of the True Cross to St Radegund in Gaul and making a gift of a superbly
enamelled cross, the "Vatican Cross", to Rome in both their names, which bore a portrait of both
Justin and Sophia on its two arms and contained another relic of the True Cross.<a href="#N_31_"><b>[[31]]</b></a> The gift to
Radegund gave rise to the composition by Venantius Fortunatus of two hymns and a poem, in
which Sophia is called the new Helena and which suggests that the relic was sent on Sophia's
initiative.<a href="#N_32_"><b>[[32]]</b></a></p><p>In their earlier years, Sophia and <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin</b></a>, like so many of <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora's</b></a> family, were seen as inclining
towards the monophysite heresy, and John of Ephesus depicts Sophia as a champion of
monophysitism until the 560s, when she found it politic to adopt an orthodox stance in religion.
According to John, a monophysite presbyter named Andrew used to administer the communion to
Sophia and all her household, while Justin was thought to take the monophysite communion more
covertly: Sophia would ask Andrew to place one "pearl" or piece of consecrated bread upon the
patten under the cloth, and it was supposed that <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin</b></a> later took it in secret.<a href="#N_33_"><b>[[33]]</b></a> In the later history
of the monophysite Michael the Syrian Sophia is shown as maintaining the faith even after her
accession,<a href="#N_34_"><b>[[34]]</b></a> though it is clear that, in order to gain <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> approbation and the possible
designation of <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin</b></a> as his official successor, she found it expedient to adopt orthodoxy in the
early 560s: Theodore bishop of Caesarea is said to have warned her that <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> was unwilling to
see power pass into the hands of one who was not committed to orthodoxy,<a href="#N_35_"><b>[[35]]</b></a> though, as it
happened, <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian </b></a>was by this point still not willing to nominate an heir. Perhaps he was not
convinced by her change of faith.</p><p>In fact Sophia may well have retained monophysite leanings. Despite her conversion to orthodoxy,
and <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin's</b></a> deep commitment to church unity, the couple remained on good terms with at least
one member of <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora's</b></a> family, her grandson, the wealthy ultra-monophysite monk Athanasios,
who actually made the couple his main heirs.<a href="#N_36_"><b>[[36]]</b></a> It may therefore be conjectured that Sophia's
conversion was a matter of policy, rather than inner conviction, and it should be noted that in his
eulogy of the couple Corippus included a prayer to Mary spoken as if by Sophia which stressed
the divine nature of Christ, and which would have caused no problems for a monophysite.<a href="#N_37_"><b>[[37]]</b></a> On
the other hand, like <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin</b></a>, Sophia was personally concerned in the persecution of monophysite
believers later in their reign, as a result of the couple's preoccupation with the need to unite
conflicting religious groups, and both <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin</b></a> and Sophia clearly felt the need to prove their
unexceptionable orthodoxy to the empire at large.</p><p>Until the early 570s <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin</b></a> and Sophia seem to have aimed at a working compromise with the
monophysites and at reconciling schismatic monophysite groups with each other, as they
attempted to do, unsuccessfully, in Egypt.<a href="#N_38_"><b>[[38]]</b></a> After attempts at conciliation had failed, <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin</b></a> tried
in another edict, probably in 571/2, to reconcile religious differences.<a href="#N_39_"><b>[[39]]</b></a> Monophysite leaders, who
felt that they had been enticed into agreeing to church union on false pretences, only intensified
their resistance at this point,<a href="#N_40_"><b>[[40]]</b></a> and <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin</b></a> and Sophia's attempt to conciliate recalcitrant bishops
met again with failure: John of Ephesus records them as saying, "Cheer up, and be comforted: for
we purpose in God to content you, and unite you to us in perfect unity."<a href="#N_41_"><b>[[41]]</b></a> But repeated failure led
to anger on the part of the imperial couple and intensive persecution of monophysite monks, nuns,
and clergy resulted.<a href="#N_42_"><b>[[42]]</b></a> In the 570s <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin</b></a> and Sophia are seen as personally visiting monophysite
monasteries and offering gifts in attempts to persuade monks to convert to orthodoxy:</p><div>"the following day [after the patriarch's visit] the king visited the monasteries in person; and the
next day the queen in like manner, offering each of them gifts, and restoring such monks as either
had, or were ready to make their submissions. But such as resisted were exiled, or sent into close
confinement, or made over without mercy to the praetorian guards to torture..."<a href="#N_43_"><b>[[43]]</b></a>  
Members of Sophia's own family were targeted in the persecution, including Georgia and
Antipatra, the wife and mother-in-law of John, one of <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora's</b></a> grandsons by her illegitimate
daughter, and John's name was also struck from the consular diptychs.<a href="#N_44_"><b>[[44]]</b></a>
<h3>Sophia in sole control</h3>
<p>Following the recommencement of hostilities with Persia in 572, after <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin</b></a> had refused to pay an
installment of tribute which was due, the Persians devastated Syria and captured Dara. <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin</b></a> had
already been showing signs of madness, and with this news his dementia set in in earnest. Sophia was
forced to have bars fixed to the windows of his rooms, after he had attempted to throw himself
out, and despite lucid intervals <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin</b></a> 
was totally unable to continue in the role of emperor.<a href="#N_45_"><b>[[45]]</b></a></p>
<p>Sophia herself was able to negotiate first a one-year and then a three-year truce with Persia,<a href="#N_46_"><b>[[46]]</b></a> but
under these circumstances it was natural that, like Ariadne at <a href="zeno.html"><b>Zeno's</b></a> death, she should be
consulted by the senate and asked to give her views on possible successors to <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin</b></a>. Although
there were family members, including her son-in-law Badouarios, who might have been suitable,
Sophia fixed on <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>, leader of the <i>excubitors</i> (one of the corps of imperial guards), whom
<a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin</b></a> was persuaded to make his adopted son and heir in December 574, and then in 578 joint
emperor.<a href="#N_47_"><b>[[47]]</b></a> Sophia may have had plans to marry <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> after <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin's</b></a> death, and there were even
rumours that she had taken him as her lover,<a href="#N_48_"><b>[[48]]</b></a> though her main priority was that there should be
no diminution of her status as empress, and <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> was made to swear that he would pay her
every honour.<a href="#N_49_"><b>[[49]]</b></a> Sophia maintained a strong interest in the treasury, even with <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> as Caesar,
scolding him for his lavish expenditure and finally taking the keys of the treasury away from him.<a href="#N_50_"><b>[[50]]</b></a>
After <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin's</b></a> death, when <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> was sole emperor, she still rebuked him for his lavish
spending: "All that we by great industry and care have gathered and stored up, you are scattering
to the winds as with a fan", she is reported to have said after <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> had spent no less than 7,200
pounds of gold,<a href="#N_51_"><b>[[51]]</b></a> and, according to Gregory of Tours, Sophia told <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> more than once that he
had reduced the state to poverty and was squandering money that it had taken her years to
accumulate.<a href="#N_52_"><b>[[52]]</b></a> Sophia can hardly have been pleased with his reply: "What you collected by iniquity
and plunder and rapine, I am doing my best that not a fragment of it may remain in my palace," or
with his remission of one-quarter of all taxes and cancellation of the charge of 4 solidi imposed by
<a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin</b></a> and Sophia on recipients of the bread dole.<a href="#N_53_"><b>[[53]]</b></a></p>
<p>The choice of <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> had a further snag, as far as Sophia's status was concerned -- he was
married. According to Theophanes, Sophia did not know that <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius </b></a>was married until his wife
<a href="ino.html"><b>Ino</b></a> arrived in Constantinople and was acclaimed, and was hoping to marry <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> and remain
empress,<a href="#N_54_"><b>[[54]]</b></a> though it is hardly tenable that <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius'</b></a>  marriage was unknown. But the fact that
<a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> had a wife meant that in matters of imperial rank and ceremonial Sophia would have a
rival. Sophia managed by simply ignoring <a href="ino.html"><b>Ino</b></a>, and prevented her from entering the palace during
the four years that <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> was Caesar, even ignoring <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin's</b></a> appeals on the subject. John of
Ephesus records her as saying to <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin</b></a>: "Fool, do you wish me to make myself as great a
simpleton as yourself? You! who have invested your slave with the insignia of sovereignty!" And
then she vowed with oaths, "I, as long as I live, will never give my kingdom and my crown to
another, nor shall another enter here as long as I am alive."<a href="#N_55_"><b>[[55]]</b></a> <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius'</b></a> wife and two daughters
therefore lived in the neighbouring Hormisdas palace and Sophia even refused to let the noble
ladies of the court pay their respects to the Caesar's wife. So embarrassed was <a href="ino.html"><b>Ino</b></a> at the
situation, and perhaps fearing at the same time some attempt on her life by Sophia, that she
actually left Constantinople.<a href="#N_56_"><b>[[56]]</b></a></p>
<p>Sophia may have hoped that <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> would divorce <a href="ino.html"><b>Ino</b></a> and marry her and proposals were made
to him through the patriarch Eutychius, on <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin's</b></a> death in October 578, that he should rid
himself of <a href="ino.html"><b>Ino</b></a> and marry Sophia or her daughter Arabia.<a href="#N_57_"><b>[[57]]</b></a> <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> refused, and instead invited
Sophia to consider herself as his mother and permitted her to remain in the palace.<a href="#N_58_"><b></b></a> That <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>
and <a href="ino.html"><b>Ino</b></a> feared that Sophia may have had designs on <a href="ino.html"><b>Ino's</b></a> safety is shown by the way that <a href="ino.html"><b>Ino</b></a> was
smuggled in a small boat into the capital and palace and proclaimed empress without Sophia's
knowledge.<a href="#N_59_"><b>[[59]]</b></a></p>
<p>While <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> was prepared to maintain Sophia's imperial status, she seems to have been
dissatisfied with the situation. According to Gregory of Tours, Sophia was implicated in a plot
against <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> in favour of <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin's</b></a> distant cousin Justinian, as a result of which she was deprived
of her, doubtless extensive, property, and left only a small allowance, while her servants were
dismissed and others appointed.<a href="#N_60_"><b>[[60]]</b></a> Since Justinian was later taken into favour, <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> apparently
considered Sophia the main force behind the conspiracy, and John of Ephesus states that she "set
on foot plots without number against king Tiberius... in bitter malice and wicked violence, being
indignant at seeing him and his wife resident in the palace, and invested with the royal authority;
and herself now in her lifetime deprived of her kingdom".<a href="#N_61_"><b>[[61]]</b></a> She continued to live in the palace,
even after <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> had found that prior to <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin's</b></a> death she had removed several hundred
pounds' worth of gold from there to her own house, but despite this concession she was unhappy
at her loss of status ("humiliated, and reduced in rank, and deserted by all men") and the presence
of a rival.<a href="#N_62_"><b>[[62]]</b></a> In fact, because she showed no signs of leaving the state apartments, <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> was
forced to remodel the whole northern side of the palace, sacrificing a beautiful garden and other
buildings to do so.<a href="#N_63_"><b>[[63]]</b></a> Theophanes' account for the year 579/80 records that Sophia finally moved
to the palace of Sophiai (which had been built for her by <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin</b></a>, not <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> as Theophanes
claims), and that she had her own <i>cubicularii</i>, and every other amenity, being honoured as
<a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius'</b></a> mother.<a href="#N_64_"><b>[[64]]</b></a> However, a surviving chapter heading from a part of John of Ephesus's <i>Ecclesiastical
History</i> in which thirteen chapters have been lost in the manuscript is devoted to the three queens
who inhabited the imperial palace after <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius'</b></a> death, which suggests that Theophanes may have
been mistaken about her removal.<a href="#N_65_"><b>[[65]]</b></a></p>
<p>Significantly, as the senior empress, her influence was still paramount. Prior to <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius'</b></a> death in
582, it was Sophia who was consulted as to a possible successor, and her recommendation of the
general <a href="maurice.html"><b>Maurice</b></a> was adopted. If she planned to marry <a href="maurice.html"><b>Maurice</b></a>, as Gregory of Tours states, she
was outmanoeuvred, and <a href="maurice.html"><b>Maurice</b></a> chose <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius'</b></a> daughter Constantina.<a href="#N_66_"><b>[[66]]</b></a> Sophia's eventual end
is not known, though she may have died prior to Phokas' take-over in 602 as she is not mentioned
in the context of his measures against the imperial family. Certainly she was still alive in 601, and
on good terms with the new empress Constantina, for on March 26, 601 Sophia is shown as
joining her in making an Easter present of a <i>stemma</i>, or crown, to <a href="<A HREF=" maurice.html"=""><b>Maurice</b></a>, which <a href="maurice.html"><b>Maurice</b></a> hung
up above the altar in St Sophia, thus offending both Augustas.<a href="#N_67_"><b>[[67]]</b></a></p>
<p>In her love of imperial status and its public recognition, and in her overt wielding of power as
empress-consort, Sophia more than matched her aunt <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a>. Her legitimising factor in the
succession was fully recognised: she was able to appoint two successors to her husband, and
retained an interest in government even after <a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin's</b></a> death, while as the dominant figure in
<a href="justinii.html"><b>Justin's</b></a> reign she was, if not the first, perhaps the most marked example of collegial rule in
Byzantium.</p>
