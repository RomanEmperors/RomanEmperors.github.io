</p><p><b><u>1. Introduction and Background:</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p><b>The Nature of the Evidence:</b></p></center>

<p>Surviving evidence for the Roman conquest of the lands south of the
Danube Valley and the rugged northern stretches of the Balkan Peninsula
is both limited and biased. The pre-Roman peoples were pre-literate and
of marginal interest to Greek and Roman writers who saw them as primitive
and ferocious barbarians: at best one might trade with these unsophisticated
folk, while at worst one might be compelled to wage war against them. No
native inhabitant of these lands wrote a history of them and Greek and
Roman writers were not sufficiently interested to take up the task. In
other words, there is no equivalent to the ethnographical sketches found
in Herodotus, Sallust's <i>Jugurthine War</i>, Caesar's <i>Gallic War</i>,
Josephus's <i>Jewish Antiquities</i> and Tacitus' <i>Germania.</i> On the
other hand, since these people were mostly Celtic, some of the remarks
found in Diodorus Siculus (5.24-32) and Caesar (<i>Gallic War</i> 6.11-28)
describing the customs and manners of the inhabitants of the Gallic lands
farther west may at least give a few hints about their society. Commencing
in AD 14, Tacitus' <i>Annals</i> do not cover the Augustan campaigns of
conquest and suppression of the great Pannonian revolt in AD 6-9; and the
books of his <i>Histories</i> which may have contained accounts of the
Flavian campaigns are lost. On the whole, the natives are enveloped in
silence, and a narrative history of them cannot be written.
</p><p>Epigraphical texts only partly compensate for the dearth of literary
evidence. There are far fewer inscriptions from the Danubian lands than
for other Roman provinces - for instance, Africa, Spain and Asia - and
most of them are from the borders and military in nature. Soldiers' tombstones
and discharge "diplomas" are, however, quite useful, as they permit military
historians to track locations of various army units, chart recruitment
patterns, and obtain glimpses into social conditions on the <i>limites</i>,
the frontier zones of the Empire. The cities of Roman Asia frequently carved
for public display letters from emperors and governors conferring privileges
on them, and Spanish cities made bronze tablets of the charters by which
they were governed as <i>coloniae et municipia</i>. That there is nothing
similar from the Danubian provinces is not surprising, as Asia, Africa,
and Spain were the most literate and Romanized regions of the Empire, and
had far more wealth available to spend on conspicuous monuments and texts.
Recent excavations have yielded the almost complete text of the dedication
inscription of Trajan's colony of Sarmizegetusa, the capital of Dacia,<b><a href="#N_1_">[[1]]</a></b>
and archaeological work is steadily if slowly and unevenly adding to our
knowledge.
</p><div><p>Several legionary fortresses lie deeply buried beneath modern cities
(York, Chester, Leon and Strasbourg come to mind), so extensive archaeology
is unlikely and the best bet is to hope that occasional rescue work in
the course of individual construction and urban renewal projects will provide
major discoveries.<b><a href="#N_2_">[[2]]</a></b> Other major military
sites have never been investigated. The fortress at Carnuntum is the only
well-excavated fortress in the area under discussion. There was never a
linear barrier comparable to Hadrian's Wall in the Danubian area, so there
will never be an inscriptional assemblage analogous to that of northern
Britain. Not only is modern knowledge heavily reliant on archaeological
discoveries for campaigns, movement of troops, construction sequences of
forts, towns and villas, but this reliance is particularly shaky for the
earlier period. There is little certainty and considerable speculation
about the location of legionary forts and which legions were stationed
where all through the Republic and Julio-Claudian period. From the beginning
of the Flavian era, 70 AD, the evidence increases in quantity and quality.

Map 1)</a></b></p></center>

<p>A rudimentary knowledge of the terrain is essential. The mountainous
lands south of the Danube river restricted ancient agriculture, settlement
patterns, the emergence of towns, trade routes, and the movement of armies.
Whether trading, migrating, or invading, people moved along the mountain
passes and river valleys. We will be following the Romans, and thus approaching
the Danubian lands from inside the Roman empire. Except for Dacia, not
annexed until after the chronological limit of this article, the Romans
gained what knowledge they had of the lands and people north and east of
the Danube through warfare and trade undertaken by businessmen venturing
into "Free Germany" on their own.
</p><div><p>The Danuvius (Danube) is the great west-to-east riverine corridor of
Europe, rising in the lands north of the Alps in southern Germany and Switzerland
and flowing some 1740 miles until it empties into the Black Sea. The double
bend in the middle reaches of the river was a focal point of Roman strategic
thinking by 100 AD, and the area remained of prime military importance
at least through the Habsburg Empire. Moving downstream, one find the following
major tributaries joining the Danube along its right (i.e., south, but
between the two bends, west) bank: the Aenus (Inn), flowing out of the
Brenner Pass; the Dravus (Drava) and Savus (Sava), out of the northeastern
Alps and running roughly parallel; and the Margus (Morava) emerging from
Macedonia and running north.<b><a href="#N_3_">[[3]]</a></b> Each of these
rivers was a primary route by which the Romans invaded, conquered and later
encouraged development. Romans tended to site legionary fortresses and
auxiliary forts on high ground at major crossings and where tributaries
merged with larger rivers. To anticipate points which will reappear below,
there were early legionary bases at Emona (Ljublana) and Siscia (Sisak)
on the upper Savus, and at Singidunum (Belgrade) at its junction with the
Danube; at Poetovio (Ptuj) and Sirmium (Mitrovica) along the Dravus; a
fortress at Viminacium (Kostolac) is near the merger of the Margus with
the Danube. Aquincum (the Buda section of Budapest) kept watch over the
Danube where an island facilitated crossing. Farther downstream, the legionary
fortress at Oescus (Gigen) was nearly opposite where the Alutus (Olt) flows
into the Danube from the north.<b><a href="#N_4_">[[4]]</a></b></p></div><center>
<p><b>The Amber Road and Celtic Settlement:</b></p></center>

<p>The prehistoric trade route known as the Amber Road stretched from the
Baltic Sea southwards along the rivers in what is now Poland and Germany
and crossed the Danube a few miles downstream from the site of Vienna.
In the early first century AD the Romans established a garrison here, at
Carnuntum (Bad Altenburg or Petronell): the site is of great significance,
so we shall return to it. Once south of the Danube the route forked: one
branch headed up the Aenus valley to the Brenner Pass and into Italy; the
other branch curved east around the Alps, picked up the Dravus or Savus,
and made its way either into Italy over the Julian Alps or southeast to
Macedonia and Thrace. Hardened resin was of course not alone in traveling
along the Amber Road, for countless peoples utilized it as well. In the
early Iron Age, from roughly 750 BC, Celtic peoples radiated out from an
initial homeland somewhere in central Europe. In two and a half centuries
they had established broad zone of relative cultural uniformity north of
the Alps and Balkan peninsula, from the Marne and Seine rivers in the west
to Transylvania and the shores of the Black Sea.
</p><p>Around 450 Celts pushed into Italy and settled all through the Padus
(Po) valley region in such numbers that it is frequently designated
<i>Gallia
Cisalpina </i>- Gaul 'this side of' (<i>cis</i>) the Alps, as opposed to
<i>Gallia
Transalpina</i>, Gaul 'beyond' the Alps.<b><a href="#N_5_">[[5]]</a></b>
On July 18 of 390 BC a Gallic raiding horde destroyed a Roman army at the
Allia River, a tributary of the Tiber, occupied and sacked Rome. The disaster
made an indelible impression on the collective Roman mentality that endured
far longer than the damage to the city: not only was the anniversary of
the Allia battle a black day (<i>dies ater</i>) in the calendar, but forever
after the Romans regarded all Gauls with suspicion.<b><a href="#N_6_">[[6]]</a></b>
</p><p>Concern over the Gallic domination of northern Italy led directly to
the Roman conquest of the area and subsequently to Roman expansion into
the Danube valley, discussed in the following sections. Just to complete
the sketch of Gallic warfare and migrations along the ancient Amber Route,
let us observe that in 280 BC Gallic tribes swooped into Macedonia and
Greece and then moved east to settle on the Anatolian plateau. From their
new homeland in Galatia they posed a constant threat to the Greek kingdom
of Pergamum until they were defeated by the Romans in 189; final conquest
and annexation came under Augustus.<b><a href="#N_7_">[[7]]</a></b>
</p><p>The Celts never established large and coherent states but were always
grouped into tribes and shifting tribal coalitions. Names and conglomerations
that appear in one place at one time disappear or dissolve and sometimes
reappear elsewhere.<b><a href="#N_8_">[[8]]</a></b> Celtic contact with
Italy and Greece was a combination of invasion, migration, and trade. Constant
inter-tribal warfare steadily led to the formation of a Celtic elite which
from 200 BC augmented its status through growing trade in luxury items
with the Mediterranean lands. The best-known object of this trade was Italian
wine, because dumps of the 5-6 gallon clay jugs (<i>amphorae</i>) in which
the wine was shipped have been mapped along the rivers of France. Perishable
or recyclable goods were certainly traded as well but leave little trace:
slaves, ores, and agricultural produce, for examples. At a slightly later
date, a center of the trade in metals was the settlement on the Magdalensberg
adjacent to the Gallo-Roman town of Virunum in the kingdom of Noricum (near
Klagenfurt in Austria).<b><a href="#N_9_">[[9]]</a></b> Lack of excavation
prevents a similar degree of knowledge of developments east of the Alps.

<p><b><u>2. Roman Control of North Italy: the Prelude to Penetration towards
the Danube Valley:</u></b>

<p>No sooner had Rome defeated Carthage in the Second Punic War (218-201)
than she launched an era of tremendous expansion and rapidly acquired an
empire. Victories against the kingdoms of Macedonia and Syria, a third
war with Carthage, and diplomatic supremacy elsewhere gave Rome imperial
possessions all around the Mediterranean by the middle of the second century.<b><a href="#N_10_">[[10]]</a></b>
Simultaneously and of greater importance here, Rome secured control of
Cisalpine Gaul. Rome followed up battlefield victories over the Celts by
founding colonies and lesser towns to garrison the newly won territories,
by building roads to link these strongpoints and facilitate the rapid movement
of her armies, and by encouraging migration from the south. A brief sketch
illustrates events.<b><a href="#N_11_">[[11]]</a></b> (Unless noted otherwise,
all dates in this section are BC.)
</p><p>Subsequent to defeating the Italian Gauls in the 190s and early 180s,
Rome moved to anchor control by developing the area up to the Alps. The
colonies of Cremona and Placentia (Piacenza) had been founded in 218 on
the eve of the Second Punic War and had nearly died out by 200; they received
reinforcements amounting to a refoundation in 190. In 189 year came the
foundation of Bononia (Bologna). Two years later the consul M. Aemilius
Lepidus conducted final pacification sweeps and initiated development of
the region by constructing the Via Aemilia from the end of the Via Flaminia
at Ariminum (founded in 268) across the Po plain to link Bononia with Cremona
and Placentia. Rome founded colonies at Parma and Mutina (Modena) along
the Via Aemilia in 183; Lepidus was the senior member of the three-man
board of colonial founders. Two years later Rome founded another colony
at Aquileia in the northeast corner of Italy. At first distant and exposed,
it was soon linked to the south by paved roads. In 175 Lepidus was consul
again and returned to Cisalpina where (if not in 187) he established a
market town called Forum Regium Lepidi (Forlì). It's no wonder that
much of this part of Italy now commemorates his achievements in its name,
Emilia.
</p><p>Aquileia is of special importance here, as it sits at the Italian terminus
of the Amber Road, is well sited to take advantage of the emerging Celtic
mines and trading depot around the Magdalensberg, and stands watch over
the ancient routes from and to the Drava and Sava valleys. The Alpine passes
northeast of the colony are under 2000 feet, much lower than those farther
west such as the Brenner and Mont Blanc, so they are ready avenues for
any peoples seeking to invade Italy.<b><a href="#N_12_">[[12]]</a></b>
Aquileia is also the real starting point for Roman expansion into the Danubian
lands. In the last two centuries BC many Roman armies marched past it on
their way to campaign in the lands east of the Adriatic Sea, imprecisely
labeled Illyricum (later Dalmatia). In the spring of 58 Julius Caesar picked
up three legions from their winter quarters at Aquileia at the start of
his war against the Helvetii and Ariovistus' Germans. It is a safe guess
that he came to this strategic city more than once in his years as governor
of Cisalpine Gaul and Illyricum.<b><a href="#N_13_">[[13]]</a></b>
</p><p>In 42 Cisalpine Gaul ceased to be a province and was annexed to Italy,
the first in a series of steps which completed the political unification
of the entire peninsula. In minor subsequent alterations a colony was established
at Tergeste (Trieste) and the northeast border of Italy was pushed from
the Timavus (Isonzo) river to the Formio (between Trieste and Koper) in
42/41.<b><a href="#N_14_">[[14]]</a></b> In 35-33 Octavian campaigned in
Illyricum, justifying the action as necessary to protect the Roman communities
along the Adriatic coast from incursions by hostile Dalmatian natives.
In reality they may have been more about building up his own image as a
commander and toughening his armies for the looming showdown war with Antony
- the decisive battle of Actium came in 31 and in 30 the suicide of Antony
(and Cleopatra) left Octavian master of the Roman world. He returned to
Italy in 29 and in 27 engineered the so-called "Settlement" by which he
became Augustus <i>princeps</i>, first emperor of Rome.<b><a href="#N_15_">[[15]]</a></b>
</p><div><p>If we shift our attention from northeast Italy to the east we find the
following developments. Four wars with Macedonia ended with Roman annexation
of the former kingdom in 146 as a province and thus permanent involvement
in the Balkan peninsula. As had been true of the Macedonian kings in earlier
centuries, Rome's governors fought interminable wars with varying success
against the intractable peoples to the north and northeast of Macedonia
proper. The <i>provincia</i> had no fixed boundaries and was truly the
zone in which Roman generals exercised their <i>imperium</i>.<b><a href="#N_16_">[[16]]</a></b>
In 72-71 the proconsul M. Terentius Varro Lucullus was the first Roman
general to fight his way to the lower Danube.<b><a href="#N_17_">[[17]]</a></b>
In 29-28 M. Licinius Crassus, also a proconsul, campaigned to the Danube
and in 27claimed both a triumph and the immensely prestigious <i>spolia
opima</i> for killing the enemy commander in single combat. This presented
an awkward problem for the newly-named Augustus, who was just then consolidating
his position as uncontested first man (<i>princeps</i>) of Rome. In a famous
political squabble he stated that Crassus was ineligible for the <i>spolia
opima</i> because only a consul had the right to them: a proconsul did
not hold the auspices and was subordinate to the Roman commander in chief
(Octavian/Augustus!).<b><a href="#N_18_">[[18]]</a></b> Neither could Crassus
receive the honorific salutation of <i>imperator</i>, as there could only
be one of them now - Augustus. After these denials Crassus' triumph must
have come as small consolation. The incident reveals the new era of the
Empire, all the more in that Crassus - still a young man - disappears from
history.

<p>In the 20s Roman armies completed the conquest of the Alps and by 15
they had pushed over the mountains and reached the headwaters of the Danube
and Rhine. A legionary fortress was soon built at Vindonissa (Windisch).
New colonies at Augusta Taurinorum (Turin) and Augusta Praetoria (Aosta)
watched the high passes at the northwest corner of Italy, three new minor
provinces were formed in the western Alps (the Maritime, Cottian and Poenine
Alps), and in 7/6 BC Augustus commemorated his campaigns in the spectacular
triumphal monument (<i>tropaeum Alpium</i>) at La Turbie above Monaco.<b><a href="#N_19_">[[19]]</a></b>
In circumstances that are poorly understood, Rome annexed the Celtic kingdom
of Noricum and made it a province in 15. The emperor did not celebrate
a triumph and no campaigns are known; consequently many scholars think
the incorporation of Noricum was a peaceful process.<b><a href="#N_20_">[[20]]</a></b>
Simultaneously, Augustus adjusted the northeastern boundary of Italy by
shifting it from the Formio to the Arsia river, thus bringing half of the
Istrian peninsula into Italy. All this set the stage for the heavy fighting
that brought the Roman Empire to the middle Danube.
</p><p>A map of the Roman Empire in the 'teens would reveal that possessions
east of the Adriatic were only tenuously linked to Italy. Only the Via
Egnatia constructed in the 130s BC led from the Adriatic across the northern
Balkans above the provinces of Macedonia and Achaea to the Hellespont and
Bosporus and Rome's valuable provinces in Asia Minor and beyond. Emerging
expansionist kingdoms among the Marcomanni and Dacians north of the middle
and lower Danube were potential dangers. Immediately on completing Roman
control of the Alps and consolidating northern Italy, Augustus determined
to cross the mountains and push toward the Danube.<b><a href="#N_21_">[[21]]</a></b>
Thus began Bellum <i>Pannonicum, </i>the<i> </i>conquest of the imprecisely
defined lands between the Danube and Macedonia called Pannonia. There were
already many Roman and Romanized towns along the Adriatic coast. Thus the
upcoming wars had two goals: protection of the inhabitants of the economically
thriving coastal towns from the natives of the mountains to the interior;
and secure the Drava and Sava valleys and thereby provide year-round land
routes linking the western and eastern halves of the empire far more firmly
than had been the case to date. The emperor's longtime chief general, M.
Vipsanius Agrippa, was to command these campaigns but he died suddenly
in the spring of 12.<b><a href="#N_22_">[[22]]</a></b> As replacement the
<i>princeps</i>
appointed his step-son Tiberius, shifting him from his previous assignment
across the upper Rhine and Danube.<b><a href="#N_23_">[[23]]</a></b>
</p><p>The ancient sources for the Pannonian conquest and subsequent revolt
are frustratingly cursory: the contemporary Velleius Paterculus 2.110-117
(who perhaps gives too much credit to Tiberius and certainly downplays
the contributions of the other commanders) and the later Dio Cassius 55.29-56.17.
One would have thought the campaigns, particularly the revolt of AD 6-9,
provided plenty of occasions for dramatic historical accounts, all the
more since both writers had personal connections to the region; Velleius
held a junior level command in the later stages of the fighting and Dio
served a term as imperial governor of Pannonia. As in earlier wars, Rome
suffered serious initial reverses but in the end triumphed through superior
discipline, capable commanders, and a sweeping sense of strategy. But dramatic
writing was beyond Velleius, who admittedly wrote only a highly condensed
summary history of Rome, whereas Dio's narrative swept through all Roman
history to the early 3<sup>rd</sup> century AD.
</p><p>In a nutshell, Roman commanders determined at all costs to conquer and
holding the essential river valleys, all of them tributaries of the Danube:
the Drava and Sava which as stressed above offer a ready land route into
northeast Italy; and the Oenus (Unas) and Urbanus (Vrba) which give access
over the relatively low passes to the Krka and thus the core of the Dalmatian
civilian settlements. In 11 Augustus annexed the vast Pannonian territory
as the imperial province of Illyricum. It is important to appreciate that
this war occurred at a time when Roman armies were simultaneously heavily
committed to the expansion of Rome's holdings east of the Rhine. More than
that, the campaigns were evidently coordinated. In both areas, the initial
campaigns went rapidly and fairly smoothly. Rome judged that the conquest
phase was complete. This was a dreadful miscalculation, for in truth the
natives were neither subdued nor eager to accept the lifestyle and values
of their oppressors which were so different from their own traditions.
</p><p>Just as Roman armies were poised to cross the Danube and crush the Marcomannian
kingdom, widespread insurgencies broke out in Pannonia in AD 6.<b><a href="#N_24_">[[24]]</a></b>
Transdanubian operations were immediately canceled. Had Pannonians and
Germans coordinated their efforts, Rome might have lost - at least temporarily
- the middle portion of her Empire. The fighting in AD 6-9 was evidently
more severe than that of the war of conquest in 13-9 BC. Rome committed
ten legions to the effort; if one assumes 5,000 men per legion and that
there was an equal number of auxiliary troops, then Rome had roughly 100,000
soldiers in the field. Tiberius took command and within a year summoned
extensive reinforcements from as far away as central Asia Minor. To facilitate
operations, in 8 Rome divided Illyricum into two new imperial provinces:
Dalmatia along the Adriatic coast and Pannonia inland to the Danube. Tiberius
conducted operations down the Sava or Drava; probably now Rome made Siscia
and Sirmium legionary fortresses. At other times he moved from the Dalmatian
coast inland. Tiberius'generals, hardly subordinate to him as regards the
size of their armies, fought their way to the Danube and up the Sava from
Moesia.<b><a href="#N_25_">[[25]]</a></b> Rome finally crushed the opposition
in 9 and learning from mistakes, imposed a heavy and permanent garrison
of six legions throughout this region: VII and XI took up residence at
Tilurium (Gardun/Trilj) and Burnum (Suplja Crkva, near Kistanje) in central
Dalmatia; XV Apollinaris was at Emona, VIII Augusta at Poetovio, IX Hispana
at Siscia - all guarding the Drava and Sava lines of communication - and
IV Scythia at Naissos (Nish) in the Morava protecting the approach from
Macedonia. Tiberius, as the emperor's adopted son and heir-apparent, was
allowed to celebrate a triumph; his legates had to be content with the
lesser <i>ovationes</i> and "triumphal insignia."
</p><div><p>Celebrations did not last long, for within a few days arrived news that
the Cheruscan king Arminius had destroyed the army of P. Quinctilus Varus
as it was returning from near the Weser to its winter quarters on the lower
Rhine at Castra Vetera. This was the infamous Teutoburger Forest disaster,
one of the worst in Roman history. The site of the battle was discovered
a few years ago and the finds are discussed separately in the DIR.<b><a href="#N_26_">[[26]]</a></b>
It is significant to observe that whereas Rome was determined to regain
and maintain the Drava and Sava valleys, and thus confirm her control of
the middle reaches of the Empire, she abruptly abandoned all lands east
of the Rhine. Fortresses along the Rhine's left bank from Castra Vetera
and Ara Ubiorum upstream to Moguntiacum (Mainz) and Vindonissa, along with
a string of auxiliary forts, stood guard along the many miles of the great
river.

and Nero: Changes under the later Julio-Claudian emperors, 14-68:</u> <a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;Map3.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=900&quot;)">(See

<p>Developments in these years are not well understood, but they speak
decisively about the nature of much military history in the Empire period.
There were no major battles, and Rome gradually loosened the occupation
in the hinterland and shifted the legions to the Danube. In 14, with the
death of Augustus and accession of Tiberius, there occurred the great mutiny
in both the Rhine and Danubian legions.<b><a href="#N_27_">[[27]]</a> </b>The
former is of no concern here, and the latter only minimally so. Tiberius'
son Drusus managed to quell the mutineers in legions VIII, IX and XV and
disperse the legions to their winter quarters, thereby spreading out the
discontent and preventing its reformation.
</p><p>In 14 or 15 Tiberius decided to move legion XV Apollinaris from Emona
to Carnuntum, which thus became Rome's first fortress on the Danube. As
already noted, the new base was the major river crossing point of the ancient
Amber Road, and Emona was near a fork where one branch went eastward and
another crossed the Julian Alps into Italy where Aquileia was the next
stop. Just as Aquileia, a colony from 181 BC, watched the Alpine passes
in the northeast corner of Italy, so now Emona received a settlement of
veterans and became a <i>colonia</i> to stand guard over the Pannonian
end of those same passes. Between them these two colonies guarded the easiest
route into Italy. Emona was also a precedent for imperial colonization
policy: almost without exception, colonies in the Empire period were founded
in decommissioned legionary fortresses and the settlers received allotments
of land which had been military property (the <i>territorium legionis</i>).
We will see this policy carried out elsewhere in the Danubian lands by
Flavian emperors, but it is detectable around the Empire.<b><a href="#N_28_">[[28]]</a></b>
</p><p>Still further, Emona was an administrative center for Pannonia, as it
was the headquarters of the imperial procurator who supervised much of
the taxation and imperial revenues in the province.
</p><p>At some point fairly early in his reign, perhaps in 20, Tiberius (14-37)
made the old military zone of Moesia an imperial province under a <i>legatus
Augusti pro praetore</i> of consular standing. In essence this reversed
the previous situation: down to this time the legate of Macedonia had conducted
operations to the Danube (i.e., the region which became Moesia), whereas
now the legate of Moesia governed Macedonia as well as Achaea = Greece.<b><a href="#N_29_">[[29]]</a></b>The
Moesian garrison was V Macedonia at Oescus and perhaps IV Scythia at Naissos.
Another legion came in under Claudius: see below. Caligula had little interest
in military affairs, none in this portion of the empire, so we can pass
over his brief reign and the first imperial assassination, without comment.
Several developments in the reign of Claudius (41-54), however, are noteworthy.
</p><p>The two Dalmatian legions, VII and XI, remained loyal to the new emperor
when the provincial legate Camillus Scribonianus revolted in 42. The emperor
recognized that their fidelity saved his throne and his life and rewarded
them with the titles <i>Claudia Pia Fidelis</i> (generally abbreviated
as Cl. p.f.). No translation rings right in English, but something like
"Claudius' own, dutiful and loyal" is meant.<b><a href="#N_30_">[[30]]</a></b>The
following year Claudius gathered an army for the invasion of Britain. Among
the legions dispatched to this island beyond the northwest corner of Europe,
was IX Hispana, whose former fortress at Siscia was shut; Vespasian founded
a colony there in the 70s. In 44 the emperor restored Macedonia and Achaea
to senatorial proconsuls, thus terminating their subordination to the legate
of Moesia dating from 20. In 45/46 Claudius shifted VIII Augusta from Poetovio
to Novae (Svistov) in Moesia on the lower Danube and replaced it with XIII
Gemina. In 55 the new emperor, Nero, closed the base of VII Cl. p.f. at
Tilurium and transferred the legion apparently to Scupi. The decision may
have been made by Claudius, whose mysterious death - probably assassinated
by his niece/wife Agrippina, Nero's mother - prevented him from carrying
it out.
</p><p>The net effect of these legionary shifts is that by Nero's death and
the end of the Julio-Claudian dynasty in 68, Rome had transferred most
of her Balkan legions from the interior of the peninsula forward to the
Danube. Still in the interior were the following: (1) XI Cl.p.f. at Burnum,
but it participated in the civil war and wound up at Vindonissa on the
uppermost Rhine where it stayed until 101 when that fortress was shut<b>.<a href="#N_31_">[[31]]</a></b>(2)
XIII Gemina at Poetovio; (3) VII Cl.p.f. at Scupi - though it may have
left for the Danube. Now on the Danube were: (1) XV Apollinaris at Carnuntum;
(2)VII Cl.p.f. at Viminacium (perhaps not till the 70s); (3) V Macedonia
at Oescus; (4) VIII Augusta at Novae, but in 70 it was moved to Argentorate
on the Ill and replaced by the new I Italica. As best as can be calculated,
then, seven legions plus their associated auxiliary units garrisoned the
Balkan peninsula and Danube valley. As the 70s and 80s revealed, that was
far too few troops, and the heavy fighting under the Flavians caused the
government to strengthen these forces considerably.
</p><center>
<p><b><u>5. The Flavian Dynasty (69 - 96):</u> <a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;Map4.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=900&quot;)">(See
Map 4)</a></b></p></center>

<p>There is no need to discuss the events of the "Year of the Four Emperors",
68-69. The winner of this civil war, T. Flavius Vespasianus, reigned until
79 and his sons Titus and Domitian followed him in 79-81 and 81-96; the
father and brothers compose the Flavian dynasty. Vespasian's reign was
mostly a time of recovery and reorganization. Several legions were disbanded
and disappeared and two new ones took their places, with the surnames <i>Flavia
firma</i> and <i>felix </i>("steadfast to"and "fortunate for the Flavians").
In several portions of the Empire the new emperor ordered substantial advances:
in Britain the legions moved northward, the Ninth Hispana from Lindum to
a new fortress at Eburacum (York), and the Twentieth Valeria Victrix<b><a href="#N_32_">[[32]]</a>
f</b>rom Viroconium (Wroxeter) to the wilds of Caledonia where it was supposed
to occupy Castra Pinnata (Inchtuthil) on the Tay river; in Germany commanders
began to annex the triangle between the upper Rhine and upper Danube (the
Black Forest), and VIII Augusta took up residence at Argentorate; in Africa
Legio III Augusta pushed southwest from Ammaedara to Theveste; in eastern
Asia Minor Rome created a huge province of Galatia-Cappadocia-Pontus-Armenia
to bring the frontier to the upper Euphrates. Nothing so dramatic in Pannonia.
Instead, Vespasian founded veteran <i>coloniae</i> in the decommissioned
fortresses at Siscia and Sirmium. Now if not earlier legion VII Cl. p.f.
moved from Scupi to Viminacium; and I Italica replaced VIII Augusta at
Novae.
</p><p>The eighties witnessed heavy fighting along the middle and lower Danube
and revealed that Roman defenses were too thin to hold this long frontier,
especially since new threats were rapidly forming. Various Indo-European
peoples known collectively as Sarmatians had largely conquered the Celtic
tribes across the sweep of lands north of the Roman Empire from the Hungarian
plain opposite the Danubian double bend to the lower Volga above of the
Black Sea<b>.<a href="#N_33_">[[33]]</a> </b>The highly fragmentary nature
of the sources make for much uncertainty as to exactly what happened and
when; what follows is broadly correct but readers should know that the
experts vary within a few years. Debate over details must not obfuscate
the big picture: the middle and lower Danubian frontier was in crisis,
Rome suffered heavy losses, two legions were apparently destroyed, replacements
and reinforcements were moved from the Balkan hinterland and other provinces
(Britain contributed one legion) into new fortresses, while a string of
auxiliary forts filled the gaps between the fortresses. One substantial
battlefield victory in 88 led to a negotiated peace treaty with the barbarians
in 89. After he was safely dead and replaced by emperors who had no interest
in assessing his reign fairly, Domitian was blamed for incompetence and
cowardice. Uneasy stability had been restored by Domitian's last years,
but then he was assassinated in September, 96 and was followed by Nerva
and, quickly, Trajan in early 98.
</p><p>The years 85-86 were critical: legion V Alaudae was heavily defeated
(if not destroyed), and the Moesian legate killed; the praetorian prefect
Cornelius Fuscus was defeated and killed; legion IV Flavia felix was hurriedly
moved from Burnum to a new fortress at Singidunum (Belgrade).<b><a href="#N_34_">[[34]]</a>
W</b>ithin a year Moesia was divided into Upper and Lower provinces, a
policy move which provided a tighter command in this dangerous theater
of war: two imperial legates of consular rank each commanded two legions
plus auxiliaries. Domitian's campaigns against the Dacians had mixed results.
Tettius Julianus won a substantial victory at Tapae in 88, but legion XXI
Rapax was apparently destroyed in 92<b>.<a href="#N_35_">[[35]]</a> </b>II
Adiutrix was moved from Deva (Chester) in Britain<b><a href="#N_36_">[[36]]
</a></b>to
a new fortress at Aquincum (Budapest) in 89/90. Downstream in Moesia,VII
Cl. p.f. occupied Viminacium, V Macedonia held Oescus, and I Italica was
at Novae. Ratiaria (Kostolac) has often been thought a fortress, but there
is no proof.
</p><p>This fighting and reallocation of military resources led directly to
Trajan's Dacian Wars in 101-102 and 105-106 and an accompanying further
rearrangement of Rome's forces along and north of the Danube: discussion
of all this lies beyond the chronological limits of this entry. Pannonia
was divided into Upper and Lower provinces in 106. As a closing glance,
let us simply note that by 115 Roman legions had been pulled out of their
old inland fortresses and were now all along the south (right) bank of
the Danube or in the new province of Dacia, annexed in 106. Nine legions
held the river and one more was far across it in Dacia. A list sets out
the bald facts. Comparison of Maps 1 and 4 shows how far Rome had come
since the campaigns of the early 2<sup>nd</sup> century BC whose moderate
but essential goal had been to secure control of northern Italy.

forms throughout. The first time a place appears, the modern name appears
in parentheses; afterwards only the ancient form. Where no form in parentheses
appears either the ancient form endures - Cremona and Parma are examples
- or there is no modern town on the site (as with Aquileia). The Romans
penetrated to the lower Danube, like that of the Macedonian kings before
them, by marching up the Axios (Vardar) valley from the Aegean and then
crossing the low pass - under 2000 ft. above sea level. - near Scupi (Skopje)
and going down the Margus.
</p><p><a name="N_4_"></a>[[4]] This principle is readily found elsewhere.
For example, the Rhineland legionary fortresses at Castra Vetera (near
Xanten) and Moguntiacum (Mainz) are opposite the mouths of the Lupia (Lippe)
and Moenus (Main); Argentorate (Strasbourg) is near the junction of the
Ill with the Rhenus (Rhine); Ara Ubiorum (from AD 50 Colonia Claudia Ara
Agrippinensium, whence Cologne/Köln) stands guard over an easy crossing
of the Rhine. As a parallel, one can think of the early American colonies
along the tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay, the location of Fort Duquesne/Fort
Pitt where the Monangahela and Allegheny rivers merge to form the Ohio,
and that of St. Louis where the Missouri joins the Mississippi. Roman historians
customarily use the word "fortress" to refer to the large camps that housed
a full legion (in a few places in the early Empire, two legions); smaller
<i>castra</i>
are lumped together as "forts." In Britain but not elsewhere archaeologists
have taken to labeling forts that evidently held a half-legion as "vexillation
fortresses." A <i>vexillatio</i> was any portion of a legion, generally
a temporary force of two or more of the ten cohorts which made up a full
legion.
</p><p><a name="N_5_"></a>[[5]] Greeks and Romans generally used different
terms for the same people. The Greeks referred to them as Celts (<i>Keltoi)</i>
and their land as <i>Keltike'</i>, whereas the Romans spoke of Gauls (<i>Galli</i>)
living in <i>Gallia</i>. The designations 'this side of' and 'beyond' the
Alps are from the viewpoint of someone in Rome. To anticipate later Roman
designations, the northern portion of Cisalpina between the Padus and the
Alps is <i>Gallia Transpadana</i>, Gaul across the Po. Gaul across the
Alps was later divided: the lower Rhone valley and the coast between the
Alps and the Pyrenees became Narbonese Gaul, named for the town of Narbo
(Narbonne); the rest of Gaul - roughly modern France, Belgium, Luxembourg
and part of Switzerland - became <i>Gallia Comata</i> or <i>Bracchiata</i>,
"long-haired or trousered Gaul" (Gallic men wore pants and had longer hair
than the Romans).

<i>The
Beginnings of Rome</i> pp. 313-326; and Cunliffe, <i>Ancient Celts</i>
pp. 75f. In the first century BC the polymath Varro calculated the date
which converts to 390 BC; his calculation was accepted by Livy (5.30-55).
The real date was probably 387 or 386: see Polybius 1.6.1 and Cornell's
analysis. "Black days" were <i>dies nefasti</i>, days on which no public
business could be conducted: see, e.g., J. P. V. D. Balsdon, <i>Life and

</p><p><a name="N_10_"></a>[[10]] Rome was thus an imperial power in the sense
that her territorial possessions and interests outside Italy constituted
an empire by 150 BC. Rome ruled her provinces directly; elsewhere she exerted
a vaguer supremacy through diplomacy, clientship and economic power. Customarily
historians speak of the Empire period in Roman history as beginning in
the years after the death of Julius Caesar; while some date the inception
of the Empire to 42 or 31 BC, most opt to start it in 27 when the civil
wars came to an end and Octavian took the name Augustus.

the grim tale. The Achaean revolt that was part of the Fourth Macedonian
War led to Rome's destruction of Corinth in 146 (the same year in which
she obliterated Carthage). While the governors of Macedonia kept an eye
on Greece proper, the Romans did not annex the area south of Macedonia

Messalla (cos. 3 BC) secured Siscia, vital for keeping open communications
with Italy. Wilkes, <i>Dalmatia</i> p. 70 suggests that Legio XX was named
Valeria Victrix to commemorate his valor; but cf. below, note 29. In 7
the legates of Moesia A. Caecina Severus (cos. 1 BC) and Galatia M. Plautius
Silvanus (cos. 2 BC) pushed westward up the Danube and Sava valleys with
a total of five legions, the same number as Tiberius had. The next year
the new legate M. Aemilius Lepidus (cos. AD 6) fought his way from Siscia
along the Oenus or Urbanus rivers and joined forces with Tiberius near
Burnum. Plautius Silvanus built the landmark family mausoleum at the Ponte
Lucano near Tivoli; cf. <i>ILS</i> 921. For Caecina Severus, see Tacitus,
<i>Annals</i>
3.33; R. Syme, <i>Augustan Aristocracy</i> (Oxford, 1986), pp. 88, 95,
101, 128, 294. Lepidus (great-nephew of the triumvir of the same name)
had been Tiberius' brother-in-law, as each was married to a Vipsania, daughter
of Agrippa. In 10 Lepidus was legate of Dalmatia and in 14 was one of several
men judged <i>capax imperii</i> by Tacitus (<i>Annals</i> 1.13.2); he died

only to Cannae [216 BC] in notoriety in Rome's long existence. Leaving
aside the Allia which threatened the very existence of a tiny Rome in 390
BC, the disaster at Arausio [Orange] in the lower Rhone in 105 BC probably
entailed as many casualties but it is poorly recorded in our sources and
Marius' victories in 102 - 101 quickly avenged it. In the late Empire one
can compare Adrianople in 378 AD.

</p><p><a name="N_28_"></a>[[28]] For instance, in 49 Claudius converted the
former fortress of Ara Ubiorum in Lower Germany into Colonia Claudia Ara
Agrippinensium; simultaneously in Britain the abandoned fortress of legion
XX Valeria (it acquired the name Victrix apparently in 61) became Colonia
Claudia Victricensis Camulodunum (Colchester), on which see P. Crummy,
<i>City
of Victory</i> (Colchester, 1997) or the somewhat older studies by J. Wacher,
<i>The
Towns of Roman Britain</i> (London, 1974), R. Dunnett,
<i>The Trinovantes</i>
(London, 1975) and G. Webster, <i>From Fortress to City</i> (London, 1988).
In the early 90s the former British fortresses at Glevum and Lindum, abandoned
since the early 70s, became colonies; they are now Gloucester and Lincoln.
The same pattern is found at Ammaedara (Haidra) and Theveste (Tebessa)
in Tunisia, at Sarmizegetusa in Dacia, and elsewhere.
</p><p><a name="N_29_"></a>[[29]] See Moscy,<i> Pannonia and Upper Moesia</i>
pp. 33, 36 (stressing campaigns but not annexation under Augustus), and
43-44. Appian, <i>Illyr</i>. 30: Tiberius annexed Moesia. Tacitus,
<i>Ann.</i>
4.75 says the first legate, Poppaeus Sabinus, died still in office 24 years
after arriving! In 44 Macedonia and Achaea reverted to senatorial proconsuls.
</p><p><a name="N_30_"></a>[[30]] See Wilkes, <i>Dalmatia</i> p. 83; Levick,
<i>Claudius</i>
pp. 59f.
</p><p><a name="N_31_"></a>[[31]] It then moved to the Danube and was permanently
at Durostorum (Silistra) from 106/107. The new IV Flavia Firma replaced
it for a few years at Burnum, but it moved up to the Danube ca. 86: discussed
below.
</p><p><a name="N_32_"></a>[[32]] Although this remains a point of uncertainty,
it seems probable that the legion was simply XX in the early Empire and
won the designation Valeria Victrix for its role in defeating Boudica in
60-61: see L. Keppie, <i>The Making of the Roman Army</i> (London, 1984),
pp. 138, 211; G. Webster, <i>Fortress into City</i> p. 136.
<i>Valeria
Victrix</i> can mean "Valiant and Victorious," as Keppie has it. But Wilkes
prefers the hypothesis that Valeria honors the accomplishments of Valerius
Messalla in the great revolt of 6-9 (<i>Dalmatia</i> pp. 70f.). Wilkes
also notes a suggestion by A. R. Birley that Claudius may have honored
his wife Valeria Messallina by naming a legion for her as he named their
son Britannicus. But in the last case, the other legions in the invasion
force should also have become
<i>Valeriae</i> - and there's no trace of
the name for them (II Augusta, IX Hispana, XIV Gemina). Another possibility
is that the legion was Valeria from, say, 6/7 AD and Victrix only from
61
</p><p><a name="N_33_"></a>[[33]] See Wilkes's discussion in <i>Rome and her
Northern Provinces</i>. The western Sarmatians -Jazyges and Roxolani- posed
an immediate danger to the Romans, even though they and the Romans cooperated
against their mutual enemies the Dacian kingdom of Decebalus. The eastern
Sarmatian Alani were not a problem, as they lived far beyond Rome's northeastern
frontiers. The arrival of the Huns in the 4<sup>th</sup> century changed
the picture.
</p><p><a name="N_34_"></a>[[34]] The transfer of IV Fl. f. left Dalmatia without
a legion, since VII Cl. p.f. had departed the province in 55. Dalmatia
was hereafter an unarmed province; its governor continued to be an imperial
legate (not a senatorial proconsul), but he had only a few auxiliary troops
and a detachment of the fleet.
</p><p><a name="N_35_"></a>[[35]] See L. Pitts and J. K. St. Joseph,
<i>Inchtuthil</i>
(<i>Britannia</i> monographs 6, 1985); P. Salway, <i>Roman Britain</i>
(Oxford, 1981), pp. 138, 149f. For the fortresses at Aquincum and Singidunum,
see Mocsy, <i>Pannonia and Upper Moesia</i> pp. 82- 92, 99, 101-111, 140.
For the wars, see Wilkes in <i>Rome and her Northern Provinces</i>; Maxfield
in Wacher, <i>Roman World</i> pp. 178ff.; Jones,
<i>Domitian</i> pp. 135-143
and 150-55. For the loss of legions V Alaudae and XXI Rapax, see, e.g.,
Keppie, <i>Making of the Roman Army</i> pp. 206, 211, 214; Jones, <i>Domitian</i>
p. 138. In 92, if not in 85, legion V Alaudae was destroyed.
</p><p><a name="N_36_"></a>[[36]]&nbsp; XX V.v. abandoned Castra Pinnata, which
was demolished, and took the place of II Ad. at Deva. See Pitts and St.

<p>Some web sites are very good and have lots of text, photos and useful
links. But sites run the gamut from official government tourist agencies
through archaeological excavations to personal travelogues.
<i>NOTE:
</i>(1)The
following are mostly in English and have substantial historical content.Many
sites allow the viewer to click a flag and get text in English. (2) Many
Roman legions have their own websites, often compiled by re-enactors. Some
are quite good, with summaries of what's known about a legion's movements
and the different fortresses it occupied over time. On the other hand,
enthusiasm sometimes outweighs sober scholarship, so use these sites with
care.
