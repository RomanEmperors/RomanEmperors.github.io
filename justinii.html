<h3>Sources</h3>
<p>Justin II's reign is covered by a number of sources, though it lacks a Procopius or Agathias whose
works have illuminated the reign of <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a>. Menander the Guardsman continued Agathias,
covering the period 558-582; more than 70 fragments are preserved in the <em>Excerpta de
legationibus</em> of Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus.<b><a href="#N_1_">[[1]]</a></b> The <em>Ecclesiastical History </em>of Evagrius
Scholasticus<b><a href="#N_2_">[[2]]</a></b> covers the years 431-594, and takes a generally hostile view of Justin II. The third
part of the <em>Ecclesiastical History</em> of John of Ephesos (in Syriac) covers the years 571-586;<b><a href="#N_3_">[[3]]</a></b>
John's view of Justin is also hostile though from a Monophysite standpoint, unlike Evagrius who
was a Chalcedonian. John's feelings were understandable, for he was imprisoned by Justin II for
his anti-Chalcedonian maneuvers. The <em>Chronicle</em> of Theophanes Confessor<b><a href="#N_4_">[[4]]</a></b> is also valuable for
the period, particularly for Justin's building program in the capital.  John of Biclaro<b><a href="#N_5_">[[5]]</a></b> was a boy in
Constantinople when Justin II became emperor, and his Latin chronicle covering the years 567-590 sheds some light on the period.  Gregory of Tours<b><a href="#N_6_">[[6]]</a></b> makes passing references to both
Justin and <a href="sophia.html"><b>Sophia</b></a>, which are valuable because they are contemporary. Paul the Deacon's <em>History
of the Lombards</em><b><a href="#N_7_">[[7]]</a></b> was written two centuries after Justin's reign, but it is neverthless important for
the story of the Lombard invasion of Italy. </p>
<p>Justin does have one encomiast, Flavius Cresconius Corippus an African schoolteacher from a
provincial town in the hinterland of Carthage, who had composed an epic on the victory of John
Troglita over the Berbers, and recited it before an audience at Carthage as part of the victory
celebration there sometime between 549 and 553. That success seems to have launched his career
as a wandering poet, producing panegyrics of cities, called <em>Patria</em>, for wealthy patrons. He made his
way to Constantinople, perhaps after the Berber rebellion of 563, and after Justin II's accession he
produced  four books in Latin hexameters in praise of the new emperor.<b><a href="#N_8_">[[8]]</a></b> He is a contemporary
source for Justin's accession to the throne. It is generally thought that he died in the early years of
Justin's reign, perhaps in 568, but that is not necessarily 
true.<b><a href="#N_9_">[[9]]</a></b> He may have lived on into the 
mid-570s. In any case, he was witness to Justin's early years, though a
professionally prejudiced one. </p>
<h3>Justin II's background. The last years of Justinian</h3>
<p>Edward Gibbon paints a gloomy picture of the final period of <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian I's</b></a> reign:
'During the last years of Justinian, his infirm mind was devoted to heavenly contemplation, and he
neglected the business of the lower world. His subjects were impatient of the long continuance of
his life and reign: yet all who were capable of reflection apprehended the moment of his death,
which might involve the capital in tumult, and the empire in civil war. Seven nephews of the
childless monarch, the sons and grandsons of his brother and sister, had been educated in the
splendour of a princely fortune; their characters were known, their followers were zealous, and as
the jealousy of age postponed the declaration of a successor, they might expect with equal hopes
the inheritance of their uncle'(<i>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i>, Chapter 45). The picture is exaggerated, although it reflects a sentiment among
historians that with <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> death in 565, an epoch had ended and what lay in the future was
decline. There were, in fact, two men who had a good claim to succeed <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a>. Both were
named Justin.</p>
<p>The first of these, and probably the better man, was Justin the son of <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> cousin
Germanus. He had inherited his father's military ability. Germanus had suffered from the empress
<a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora's</b></a> dislike, and having no child by Justinian (she did have a bastard daughter, and possibly
a bastard son too, if we can believe the dubious testimony of Procopius' <em>Secret History</em>), she faced
the distasteful possibility that one of Germanus' children might inherit the throne.  She did what she
could to prevent it. <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a> had been dead for seventeen years when <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> died; yet it was
perhaps his memory of her which prevented <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> from naming Germanus' son as his
successor. The other Justin was the son of <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> sister Vigilantia, and his wife <b><a href="sophia.htm&quot;">Sophia</a></b> was
probably <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora's</b></a> niece, the daughter of one of her sisters, either Comito or Anastasia.<b><a href="#N_10_">[[10]]</a></b> In
552, <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> had named him to the office of <em>cura palatii</em>, which in the 5<sup>th</sup> century had usually
been held by an official with the rank of <em>spectabilis</em>, who was in charge of day-to-day affairs and
business in the palace. But with Justin's appointment, the office took on new significance.<b><a href="#N_11_">[[11]]</a></b> Thus
Justin the son of Vigilantia was in Constantinople at <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> death and could count on the
support of the patriarch, John of Sirimis a.k.a John Scholasticus, as well as that of the Count of the
Excubitors, Tiberius, who would eventually succeed him to the throne. Justin the son of
Germanus was Master of the Soldiers in Illyricum and was guarding the Danube frontier. His
supporters in the Capital were outmaneuvered by the speed and smooth efficiency with which his
rival's cabal engineered the succession. When <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> breathed his last, the only official present
was the <em>praepositus</em> of the Sacred Bedchamber, and he claimed that before his death, Justinian had
named Justin, the son of Vigilantia, his successor. There was no one in a position to gainsay it.</p>
<p>Evagrius,<b><a href="#N_12_">[[12]]</a></b> who disliked Justin II, reported that the two Justins had made a gentleman's
agreement before <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> death that whoever became emperor assign his namesake second
place in honor. Thus when Justin, the son of Vigilantia, became emperor, he recalled the other
Justin and received him affably, but then he withdrew his bodyguard, refused him access to himself
and finally sent him to Alexandria, where he was murdered in his bed. The report continued that
Justin II and empress <b><a href="sophia.html">Sophia</a></b> wanted to see the head of Justin, son of Germanus, after his murder
and when it was brought to them, they kicked it. <b><a href="sophia.html">Sophia</a></b> was blamed: John of Biclaro who was in
Constantinople at the time and would have known the rumors of the day, reported that Justin was
killed in Alexandria by a faction loyal to <b><a href="sophia.html">Sophia</a></b>.<b><a href="#N_13_">[[13]]</a></b> This much is true: Justin II had his rival
murdered. However Justin II continued to use the services of Germanus' other son, Justinian, who
like his brother was a highly competent military commander. </p>
<p>The empire which Justin II inherited had expanded greatly as a result of <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> policy of
reconquest. In the east, Byzantium held the western part of Armenia and the frontier with Persia
ran between the imperial fortress of Daras and Nisibis, which was under Persian control. It
embraced the Negev desert, the Sinai peninsula, Egypt south to Philae at the First Cataract, and
North Africa as far west as Mauretania. Septimum (Tangiers) was Byzantine and across the Strait
of Gibraltar in Spain, the area around Malaga and Cartagena was under imperial control,<b><a href="#N_14_">[[14]]</a></b> as well
as the Balearic Islands, Sardinia and Corsica, Malta and Sicily, and nearly all of present-day Italy.
In the Balkans there were still no permanent Slavic settlements south of the Danube.<b><a href="#N_15_">[[15]]</a></b> The
Byzantine grip on the Danube frontier was still firm,<b><a href="#N_16_">[[16]]</a></b> but north of it were Slavs, Gepids and
Lombards, and in 558, the Avars, newly arrived from the Russian steppe whence they had been
ousted by their former subjects, the Turks. They had sent envoys to <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> and concluded an alliance
which included a subsidy. </p>
<p>The eastern frontier was relatively peaceful. In 562, Persia had concluded a fifty-year peace which
required a yearly subsidy; the subsidy for the first seven years had been paid right away, and in the
eighth year, the subsidy for the next three years would fall due. With the eleventh year, the subsidy
was to become an annual payment. <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> policy of paying potential enemies to stay outside
the frontiers and keep the peace was bitterly criticized, as any reader of Procopius' <em>Secret History</em>
will realize, but judged from a purely fiscal standpoint, it made sense. Wars were more expensive
than subsidies, and some of the gold sent to these potential enemies would find its way back
across the frontier, for it would be used to buy the products of the empire. However <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> left
a host of unpaid debts behind him. One of Justin II's first moves was to pay off <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a>
IOUs, for <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> in his last years had raised money by forced loans; moreover, his focus on religious
dogma had left no room for attention to the impending financial crisis.<b><a href="#N_17_">[[17]]</a></b> Justin's parsimony, and
the reputation for avarice<b><a href="#N_18_">[[18]]</a></b> to which it gave rise, was mandated by his predecessor's financial
policies.</p>
<p>Imperial unity also depended upon theological peace, and here <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> left a darker legacy. He
died just as he was about to enforce a decree making the heresy of aphthartodocetism, an extreme
form of Monophysitism, the official belief of the empire. The patriarch of Constantinople,
Eutychius, had been hustled off into exile for opposing <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> decree. His place was taken
by John of Sirimis, or John Scholasticus, whose theology was Chalcedonian, though he managed
to postpone a collision with <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> long enough for death to claim the old emperor. <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a>
died just in time to abort a potentially disastrous church crisis. </p>
<p>However, the division between the Chalcedonians and the Monophysites was as wide as ever, and
now that the Monophysites had priests and bishops of their own, it was less likely that the schism
would ever be healed. The empress <b><a href="sophia.html">Sophia</a></b>, like her aunt, had been openly Monophysite, and
Justin II had possibly leaned in the same direction, but realizing that Monophysite sympathies
would be a political liability for an ambitious emperor-in-waiting, both had become solidly orthodox. 
<b><a href="sophia.html">Sophia</a></b>'s conversion took place just three years before <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> death.<b><a href="#N_19_">[[19]]</a></b></p>
<h3>Justin's accession.</h3>
<p>For Justin's accession we have the account of Corippus, who loses no opportunity to present
Justin in a good light; nonetheless it is clear that the affair was stage-managed by an inside group
of palace officials. <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> died suddenly in the night of November 14/15, probably in his sleep.
However, the chamberlain Callinicus claimed that, with his last breath, he had designated Justin, the
son of Vigilantia, as his heir. Callinicus and a group of senators who had been roused from their
beds hurried to Justin's palace where Justin and Vigilantia met them, and reported <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a>
death and his dying behest.  Justin made the customary show of reluctance, but he yielded speedily
enough to the entreaties of the senators, and, escorted by them, he and <b><a href="sophia.html">Sophia</a></b> went to the Great
Palace. The Excubitors, commanded by <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>, who was Justin's supporter and his eventual
successor, blocked the palace doors.  Before <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> death was reported in the city, Justin
had been crowned by the patriarch. By morning, the coronation was a <em>fait accompli. </em>Justin
appeared, wearing the crown, in the imperial box, the <em>kathisma</em> in the Hippodrome, where he
received the acclamations of the people and addressed them. The day after his inauguration, Justin
crowned his wife <b><a href="sophia.html">Sophia</a></b> as Augusta. Then he moved quickly to win popular support. <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a>
debts were repaid; taxation arrears were cancelled. The consulship which had lapsed in 541 was
restored, which opened a window of opportunity for the kind of largess that won plaudits. All
went well.<b><a href="#N_20_">[[20]]</a></b>  </p>
<p>Assassination speedily removed the other Justin, the son of Germanus. Contemporaries blamed
<b><a href="sophia.html">Sophia</a></b>. At any rate, it may have been the murder of the other Justin which sparked a conspiracy in
the second year of Justin's reign. Two senators, Aetherios and Addaios, were involved. Aetherios'
nephew had been involved in the so-called 'Bankers' Plot' against <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> in 562<b><a href="#N_21_">[[21]]</a></b> but
Aetherios himself and Addaios had a clear record of loyalty and service; in <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> last year,
on his orders they had taken a detachment of troops into the church of SS. Sergius and Bacchus
where a service was going on, and seized the patriarch Eutychius who had resisted the emperor's
aphthartodocetist decree. Now they evidently planned to poison Justin. Aetherios confessed and named
Addaeus as his accomplice. Both were executed.<b><a href="#N_22_">[[22]]</a></b></p>
<h3>Justin's foreign relations.</h3>
<h3>i)  Europe</h3>
<p>'Proud, arrogant, unshakeable in his self-confidence, (Justin) believed implicitly that with wisdom
and determination, those enemies (of the empire) would be scattered  - and that he was the man to
do it.' Thus John Julius Norwich in his popular <em>Byzantium. The Early Centuries.</em><b><a href="#N_23_">[[23]]</a></b> Norwich has
neatly summed up the attitude which Justin assumed at his accession. Within a week, he had
received envoys from the Avars and refused them the subsidies which his predecessor had paid
them. Justin was to be disappointed and his disillusion led to madness. But that was in the future.</p>
<p>Sirmium, modern Sremska Mitrovica, was a bone of contention. It had been briefly the seat of the
praetorian prefect of Illyricum until the Huns forced the prefect to relocate swiftly to
Thessolonika. After the Hun conquest (440/1), <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> regained it briefly in 535, but lost it
within a year to the Gepids.<b><a href="#N_24_">[[24]]</a></b>  In 549, however, the Gepids were at war with the Lombards, who
sought an alliance with <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a>, pointing out that they were orthodox Christians whereas the
Gepids were Arians.<b><a href="#N_25_">[[25]]</a></b> Whether <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> was deceived by this claim or not, he sent 15,000 troops
to aid the Lombards, which by the standards of the day was an exceptionally large force, and it
seems to have frightened the Gepid king into a truce with the Lombards. Once the imperial army
had left the scene, however, the Gepid-Lombard truce broke up, but now the Gepid king Thorison
and the Lombard, Audoin, found that the rank and file of their armies were unwilling to fight each
other.  Once again they made a truce. The Gepids still held Sirmium, though they had to cede
control of some parts of Dacia Ripensis and Upper Moesia to Byzantium.</p>
<p>War between the Gepids and Lombards started again in 565, the year of Justin II's accession.
The Lombards got the upper hand and the Gepid king Cunimund sought Justin II's help,
promising Sirmium in return. In the second round of battle the Gepids were victorious with
imperial help, but Cunimund broke his promise and kept Sirmium. The Lombards then turned to
the Avars for assistance.</p>
<p>Faced with a Lombard-Avar alliance, Cunimund came once more to Justin, offering Sirmium again
in return for help. Justin allowed the Gepids to believe he would send aid, but meanwhile he
promised the Lombards that he would remain neutral. The Gepid garrison in Sirmium, thinking
Justin was an ally, handed over the city to a Byzantine force and went off to join their army
against the Lombard-Avar alliance. In the battle that followed, the Gepid kingdom was utterly
destroyed. The Lombard king, Alboin, who had succeeded Audoin, slew Cunimund, severed his
head and made it into a drinking cup: a savage act which roused the hatred of Cunimund's
daughter, Rosemunda. Alboin took Rosemunda as one of the spoils of victory, and married her. It
was an unwise union: Rosemunda eventually avenged her father. The Avars arrived too late to take part in the Gepid defeat, but they were in time to share the
spoils: they acquired the Gepid lands east of the Danube. Justin II kept Sirmium, though the Avars
coveted it.The Lombards acquired the Avars as neighbours.</p>
<p>They were prickly neighbours. In 568, the Lombards, finding their new situation too
uncomfortable, left for Italy led by Alboin. Paul the Deacon, writing a couple centuries later,
records that Alboin invited his old friends, the Saxons, to join him, and 20,000 men with their
women and children answered the invitation. The horde contained others as well: Gepids, Bulgars,
Sarmatians, Noricans and Pannonians (presumably inhabitants of the old Roman provinces of
Noricum and Pannonia) and Suevi, who still lived in their separate villages in Italy in Paul's day.<b><a href="#N_26_">[[26]]</a></b> 
They occupied most of Venetia on their arrival, and the next year, in 569, most of Liguria. The
Byzantine forces were ill-prepared, and Italy was exhausted by a recent outbreak of plague. The
year before the invasion, Narses, who had won the final victory over the Ostrogoths which had
eluded Belisarius, had been dismissed from his command. The <em>Liber Pontificalis<b><a href="#N_27_">[[27]]</a></b> </em>records that
the citizens of Rome, weary of Narses' autocracy, had petitioned Justin and <b><a href="sophia.html">Sophia</a></b> to have him
removed; otherwise they would go over to the barbarians. Narses, learning of the petition, left
Rome for Naples,<b><a href="#N_28_">[[28]]</a></b> where Pope John III followed him and begged him to come back to Rome.
Thus Narses remained in Rome until his death, watching the Byzantine defences in Italy crumble.
He died in 574, old and wealthy, and his body was put in a lead coffin and taken back to
Constantinople. <b><a href="sophia.html">Sophia</a></b> is supposed to have been his enemy and to have exchanged insults with
him when he was dismissed, but the evidence is not above suspicion.<b><a href="#N_29_">[[29]]</a></b> </p>
<p>The Avars then turned their attention to Justin, whom they accused of giving asylum to some
fugitive Gepids. The Avar khan Baian waited until the Byzantines had suffered a defeat at the
hands of the Persians. Then in 573 or the start of 574, the Avars crossed the Danube and defeated
an army which <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>, the Count of the Excubitors, led out against them. By this time, Justin's
sanity had snapped at the news of the capture of Daras by the Persians in November of 573, and
the empress <b><a href="sophia.html">Sophia</a></b> promoted <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> as co-ruler, cajoling her husband into  raising him to the
rank of Caesar on 7 December, 574. <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> made peace. Sirmium remained Byzantine: the
Avars did not take it until 582, by which time it was largely depopulated, but they did get 60,000
gold <em>solidi</em> and were well positioned to extort more.<b><a href="#N_30_">[[30]]</a></b> Justin's defiant Avar policy had ended in
complete failure.</p>
<p>Yet the Danube frontier still held. The remains of ancient forts along the Lower Danube indicate a
Byzantine presence there to the end of the sixth century and even later. Yet early in the reign of
Justin's successor <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius II</b></a>, a horde of Avars and Slavs swept south. <i>Circa</i> 582 there was
temporary but devastating Slavic and Avar attack on Athens.  From 587 to 805, the Slavs
controlled the eastern Peloponnesus.<b><a href="#N_31_">[[31]]</a></b> When the new museum at Olympia was being built, a Slav
burial was discovered and a Slav burial dating to this period has also been recognized at
Corinth.<b><a href="#N_32_">[[32]]</a></b>  Justin II did not live to see the failure of his policy in Illyricum.</p>
<p>In the rest of Europe, <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> policy of <em>reconquista</em> was not quite completely in ruins, but the
limitations of Byzantine power became painfully evident. In Spain, the Visigothic king Leovigild
(568-586) undertook the political unification of the peninsula, and founded a royal capital at
Toledo in imitation of Constantinople. This was a period of strong Byzantine influence: Leovigild
and the Gothic kings who succeeded him adopted Byzantine court ceremonial and imperial regalia
and took the empire as their model. But cultural and political dominance did not go hand-in-hand.
Between 569 and 572, Leovigild attempted to reduce the Byzantine enclave in Spain, and
captured Asidona and Corduba, but in 572 he made peace with Justin on the basis of mutual
recognition of each other's territory. Not until ca. 624 did a Visigothic king (Suinthila) dislodge
the empire from Cartagena and Malaga. In Africa there was a poorly-documented war with the
Berbers who rose in rebellion under a king named Garmul and killed the praetorian prefect
Theodore in 569. In the following two years, two successive 'Masters of the Soldiers' also met
their deaths, and it took several years before peace returned.<b><a href="#N_33_">[[33]]</a></b> </p>
<p>In Italy, Byzantium regarded its setbacks as temporary and continued to hope for a recovery. In
the countryside, there was a network of <em>castra</em> manned by imperial and locally-recruited troops,
where the rural population could take refuge, and the Byzantines held the walled cities. But these
strongholds could be starved out; it was famine, for instance, that forced the surrender of Pavia
(Roman Ticinum) after a siege of more than three years.<b><a href="#N_34_">[[34]]</a></b> Alboin was murdered in 573 in an
abortive <em>coup d'état</em> in which his wife Rosamunda was the leading spirit, though it is not unlikely
that there was Byzantine involvement, for Rosamunda and her accomplice fled to Ravenna. The
next year a similar fate befell Alboin's successor, Cleph, and for the next ten years, the Lombard
horde fragmented into thirty groups led by dukes, one of whom made his headquarters at Spoleto
and another at Benevento. The imperial forces did attempt a counter-offensive in 576, under
Justin's son-in-law Baduarius, but he was defeated and died in Italy.<b><a href="#N_35_">[[35]]</a></b> <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius'</b></a> coronation took
place two years later, in 578, and the envoys of the Roman senate carried with them an urgent
appeal for military aid to the new emperor, but the empire had no military assistance to offer. It
was busy with the Balkans and the East, and in Italy it relied on diplomacy backed by gold to
subvert Lombard dukes or buy help from the Merovingian Franks. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, the empire did not give up and continued to try to win Frankish support against the
Lombards. What ended imperial resistance finally was the <em>coup d'état</em> of Phocas and the murder
of the emperor Maurice. Yet Rome, Naples, Genoa and Ravenna held firm. Genoa and Naples
were defended by their inhabitants, Rome's defense was directed by the popes and Ravenna, safe
behind its swamps, was the imperial headquarters. Under Maurice, emperor from 582 to 602, the
Exarchate of Ravenna was organized<b><a href="#N_36_">[[36]]</a></b> with the Exarch given entire control over civil and
military affairs.  Until Ravenna finally fell to the Lombards in 751, the Exarch maintained the
remnants of Justinian's reconquest. </p>
<h3>ii)  On the Persian frontier.</h3>
<p>The peace treaty of 562 between Byzantium and Persia did not settle everything. The question of
Suania was unresolved. The Byzantines wanted it, for if they secured its passes, they could
prevent Persian raids on the border areas of Lazica. Justin II just after his accession sent John
Komentiolus (or Domentiolus) to king Khusro of Persia to negotiate, but to Justin's annoyance,
John allowed himself to be outmaneuvered. The negotiations dragged on until 572, when Justin
repudiated the treaty. When the subsidy that was to be paid Persia under the terms of the treaty
came due, Justin refused to pay.<b><a href="#N_37_">[[37]]</a></b></p>
<p>Suania was only one factor. The Lakhmids, Arab allies of Persia, led by their sheikh 'Amr,
continued to make raids across the imperial frontier in violation of a clause in the treaty  which
forbade the Lakhmids and their adversaries, the Ghassanids,<b><a href="#N_38_">[[38]]</a></b> who were Byzantine allies, from
warring with each other. 'Amr was killed in 569, and the Ghassanids under their sheikh Mundhir,
defeated his brother and successor Kabus in battle ca. 570.  But in the same year Khusro sent a
Persian force to Himyar (Yemen) to help a Himyarite prince oust the Ethiopian garrisons, and
bring Himyar within the Persian orbit. Himyar lost its independence and was put under a Persian
governor.<b><a href="#N_39_">[[39]]</a></b></p>
<p>There was another factor as well motivating Justin's repudiation of the fifty-year peace treaty with
Persia. Persarmenia, the portion of Armenia under Persian control, revolted and the <em>marzpan</em> (the
Persian governor) Chihor-Vshnasp was killed. The cause of the revolt was the Persian attempt to
erect a Zororastrian fire-temple at Duin, the seat not only of the <em>marzpan</em>  but also of the
Armenian patriarch or <em>katholikos</em>.  Evagrius (5.7) reports that the Persarmenians wanted to be
Roman subjects so as to practice their religion in safety, and they sent a secret mission to Justin II
and Justin came to an agreement with them. When Khusro complained, Justin replied that he
could not reject the pleas of fellow Christians, and in any case, the peace treaty had expired.
Nonetheless, Evagrius adds with disapproval, Justin did not prepare properly for war. </p>
<p>For his part, the Persian king Khusro was not unhappy at the prospect of renewed hostilities. In
569 an embassy from the Turks of central Asia had reached Constantinople, bringing with it a
proposal for opening a silk route which would bypass Persia. The Turks were the cause of the Avar
migration westwards, for the Avars had been their overlords.  Once the Turks had cast off
Avar domination, they pursued a group of them across the steppe, building up as they did, an
empire of their own which stretched from Mongolia to Turkestan and was now expanding
towards the Caspian Sea. They had already helped the Persians eliminate the Ephthalites or 'White
Huns'<b><a href="#N_40_">[[40]]</a></b> in 557, but the Persians recognized the Turks as potential enemies and abhorred their
proposed silk route. Justin II, on the other hand, was very interested, and concluded an alliance
which lasted until 576, when the Turkish khan broke it off abruptly. The alliance with the Turks
increased Justin's confidence and annoyed Persia.<b><a href="#N_41_">[[41]]</a></b></p>
<p>The war started out well enough. The Master of Soldiers, Marcian, who was <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's </b></a>nephew,
won some initial skirmishes, and laid siege to Nisibis. But the siege dragged on and Justin,
becoming impatient, replaced Marcian with a commander whom the army refused to accept, and
the mutiny ended the siege of Nisibis. It was during the siege, however, that Justin picked a
quarrel with his Ghassanid allies. The Ghassanid sheikh Mundhir had defeated the Lakhmids in
569 and 570, but he had suffered losses in manpower and he asked Justin for gold with which to
recruit more fighting men. Justin was prone to explosions of anger,<b><a href="#N_42_">[[42]]</a></b> and Mundhir's request
infuriated him. He sent a dispatch to Marcian instructing him to kill Mundhir, and it fell into
Mundhir's hands (autumn, 572). Deeply offended and probably a little frightened, Mundhir rode
off with his tribesmen into the desert, and it was not until the spring of 575 that he decided to
return to his old loyalties. The Ghassanid withdrawal opened the way for a raid by the Lakhmids
into Syria in 573, and for a two-pronged Persian attack, with one spearhead under Khusro
advancing to relieve Nisibis while the other ravaged Syria, took Apamea and sacked it, and then
joined Khusro in laying siege to the great fortress of Daras. After five months, Daras fell in
November, 573. Evagrius reported rumors that the commander had been negligent, or that he had
betrayed the city. The news was too much for Justin. He went mad.<b><a href="#N_43_">[[43]]</a></b> The empire was in crisis,
and as if the emperor's insanity and the defeat on the eastern frontier were not calamities enough,
there was another outbreak of bubonic plague in Constantinople.<b><a href="#N_44_">[[44]]</a></b></p>
<h3> The Empress Sophia and the Accession of Tiberius.</h3>
<p>It was the empress <b><a href="sophia.html">Sophia</a></b> who stepped into the breach.  She turned for help to the Count of the
Excubitors, <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>,who was a loyal retainer with a military reputation which his recent defeat by
the Avars had not tarnished. He was also a handsome, affable man, though a little too prodigal
with money for <b><a href="sophia.html">Sophia</a></b>'s liking, and she thought she could dominate him. She probably would
have preferred to rule herself, but the empire was not ready for a woman as sole regent, and on 7
December, 574, when Justin had a moment of lucidity, she persuaded him to appoint <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>
Caesar.<b><a href="#N_45_">[[45]]</a></b>  To deal with the immediate crisis on the Persian frontier, she dispatched a letter to
Khusro, bewailing her fate and reproaching him for trampling on a defenseless woman. She
reminded him that when he had fallen sick, Constantinople had sent its best doctors to him, and
they had healed him. Khusro was moved, and allowed <b><a href="sophia.html">Sophia</a></b> to buy a first a one-year and then a
three-year truce,  which, however, excluded Armenia. It provided a breathing space used to build up the army, spending money lavishly, and <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> put it 
under the command of Justinian, the son of Germanos and brother of the Justin who had been Justin II's rival. In 575,
Justinian won a major victory at Melitene, the metropolis of Armenia II, though he failed to save
Melitene itself from destruction. In 578, the three-year truce expired and war flared up again along
the Persian frontier.<b><a href="#N_46_">[[46]]</a></b></p>
<p> <b><a href="sophia.html">Sophia</a></b> was determined to maintain her own position, and as long as Justin was alive and she was
still Augusta, she refused to let <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> bring his wife, <b><a href="ino.htm&quot;">Ino</a></b>, into the palace. Theophanes<b><a href="#N_47_">[[47]]</a></b> reports
that <b><a href="sophia.html">Sophia</a></b> wanted to marry <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> herself, and she forced him to install his family in the palace
of Hormisdas where <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> and <a href="dora.html"><b>Theodora</b></a> had lived before <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> became emperor. Her
tactics finally succeeded in making <b><a href="ino.htm&quot;">Ino</a></b> move away from Constantinople itself. But <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>
showed no inclination to abandon his wife and even before Justin died 578, <b><a href="sophia.html">Sophia</a></b> was conspiring
with Justinian, the son of Germanus, to replace <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>. Gregory of Tours reports a plot to kill
<a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> in the Hippodrome immediately after his coronation, and when that plan failed, and
Justinian bought pardon with 1,500 gold pounds, <b><a href="sophia.html">Sophia</a></b> continued to scheme.<b><a href="#N_48_">[[48]]</a></b> </p>
<p>But once <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> became emperor, <b><a href="sophia.html">Sophia</a></b> had eventually to accept defeat, however reluctant she
might be. 'The factions of the Hippodrome' wrote Edward Gibbon, referring to <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius'</b></a>
coronation, 'demanded, with some impatience, the name of their new empress; both the people
and <b><a href="sophia.html">Sophia</a></b> were astonished by the proclamation of Anastasia, the secret, though lawful wife of
the emperor Tiberius.'<b><a href="#N_49_">[[49]]</a></b> Gibbon erred on one point: <b><a href="ino.htm&quot;">Ino</a></b>, renamed Anastasia once she
became empress, cannot have been a secret wife. But her coronation as Augusta must have been a
bitter blow to <b><a href="sophia.html">Sophia</a></b>, who clung to her prerogatives as long as she could, though finally, much
against her better judgment, she moved into the Sophianae palace across the Bosporus,<b><a href="#N_50_">[[50]]</a></b> which
had been built by Justin. </p>
<h3>Justin's Religious Policies.</h3>
<p>The general tenor is clear. On becoming emperor, Justin rescinded <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> aphthartodocetist
decree and tried to steer a middle course between the Chalcedonians and the Monophysites.
Imprisoned Monophysite churchmen were released and exiled bishops allowed to return. Leading
Monophysites including Jacob Baradaeus himself were invited to Constantinople and interminable
discussions ensued which produced nothing. So Justin produced a new <em>Henotikon</em>, in imitation of
the emperor <a href="zeno.html"><b>Zeno's</b></a> <em>Henotikon</em>, which had triggered the Acacian Schism. It had been <a href="justin.html"><b>Justin I's</b></a>
abandonment of the <em>Henotikon</em> and his persecution of the Monophysites which sowed the seeds of
a separate Monophysite hierarchy.   By the time Justin II became emperor, there already existed
a Monophysite church which took its name, 'Jacobite' from Jacob Baradaeus. An imperial
emissary presented Justin's new compromise to the Monophysite clergy and monks assembled at
Callinicum. It was an accomodating document: it went so far as to rehabilitate Severus, the
Monophysite patriarch of Antioch in the latter years of the emperor <a href="anastasi.html"><b>Anastasius</b></a>. Jacob Baradaeus
himself and the clergy were favorably inclined, but the monks would have nothing to do with it.
The meeting ended with a violent spat within the Monophysite ranks, between the moderates and
the extremists. </p>
<p>Justin tried again with a new edict which recognized the One Nature of the Logos, while asserting
at the same time, the distinction between the natures of Christ, but without mentioning Chalcedon.
Yet the Monophysites were obdurate, whereupon Justin turned to persecution, seconded by his
Chalcedonian patriarch, John Scholasticus. The persecution continued until Justin lapsed into
madness and <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> took over. <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> lacked the instincts of a persecutor, and in any case, he
wanted to maintain good relations with the Monophysite Ghassanids, whose friendship was
necessary for the security of the eastern provinces. But finally under the influence of <a href="maurice.html"><b>Maurice</b></a>, who
was to succeed him as emperor, <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> too turned to persecution.<b><a href="#N_51_">[[51]]</a></b></p>
<p>That is a general sketch of what happened.  It is more difficult to time the sequence of
events with accuracy. Justin and <b><a href="sophia.html">Sophia</a></b> moved first after <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> death to reassure the
Chalcedonians on the one hand, while at the same time making conciliatory gestures towards the
Monophysites. Justin cancelled 'those things which had been approved in contradiction to the
synod of Chalcedon',<b><a href="#N_52_">[[52]]</a></b> thereby abrogating <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> lapse into aphthartodocetism, and ordered
the creed approved by the First Council of Constantinople of 381 to be read in all Catholic
churches before the Lord's Prayer. John of Biclaro, who records this, puts it in Justin's first year,
which he misdates to 567. But his report, once the date is corrected, shows that Justin's first
concern was to distance himself from the heresy which <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> had adopted in the final months
of his life.</p>
<p>At the same time, Justin received the aged Monophysite leader Theodosius with honor, and
sponsored a series of meetings of the Monophysite bishops in Constantinople. The chair was the
strongly Chalcedonian patriarch of Constantinople, John Scholasticus. The meetings themselves
were inconclusive, but Justin recognized their tenor and formulated his first <em>Henotikon</em>, which was
presented to the Monophysite clergy and monks who assembled at the monastery of Mar Zakai at
Callinicum. It caused a riot. But negotiations continued and a second <em>Henotikon</em> emerged which is
recorded in Evagrius' <em>Ecclesiastical History,</em><b><a href="#N_53_">[[53]]</a></b> though Evagrius confuses it with the first
<em>Henotikon.</em></p>
<p>This second confession of faith was perhaps a little more hard-nosed than the first. It omitted any
mention of the controversial Chalcedonian Creed, the name of which no Monophysite could hear
without reacting with rage. Its definition of the nature of Christ was careful. 'While considering
His (Christ's) ineffable union we rightly confess one nature, that of the Divine Word, to have
become incarnate, by flesh animated with a reasonable and intelligent soul; and on the other hand,
while contemplating the difference of natures, we affirm that they are two, without, however,
introducing any division ' The credo confessed one and the same Christ, God and man together.
All who thought differently were anathematized.  The Monophysites were not impressed and Justin used force. The last chance for reconciliation
was lost.<em> </em> But perhaps it had never really existed.  </p>
<h3>Conclusion.</h3>
<p>Justin II has not fared well at the hands of historians. A. H. M. Jones<b><a href="#N_54_">[[54]]</a></b> refers to his
'megalomaniac and irresponsible foreign policy' and attributes his persecution of the
Monophysites to an outburst of bad temper.  Vasiliev calls him 'weak-minded and childless'
memorable chiefly for the moving and pathetic speech he made when he appointed <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>
Caesar.<b><a href="#N_55_">[[55]]</a></b> Few historians, with the notable exception of Averil Cameron, have taken him very
seriously, and even she acknowledges that there is not a great deal to be said in Justin's favor.<b><a href="#N_56_">[[56]]</a></b>
In his own day, he did not enjoy a good press. John of Ephesus was unkind, and little wonder, for
he suffered from Justin's persecution of the Monophysites. But neither was Evagrius sympathetic,
and he was orthodox.</p>
<p>We must admit that Justin's new foreign policy, which he initiated at his succession, did not yield
notable results. He took the view that 'a Roman emperor should not bribe barbarians to keep the
peace, but impose his will by force of arms.'<b><a href="#N_57_">[[57]]</a></b> There can be little doubt that this was a far more
popular policy in Constantinople than his predecessor's. Nor can we claim that a policy of
appeasement would have produced better results.  Yet the fact is that the empire, its manpower
resources weakened as they were by plague, lacked the military strength to sustain a bellicose
policy, and it had to return to <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> policy of using gold to manipulate its enemies on the
frontiers. </p>
<p>Yet Justin dealt ably with the financial crisis at <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> death, though how serious the crisis was
is debatable. He restored a healthy balance in the imperial treasury, and thanks to the fiscal
prudence of Justin and <b><a href="sophia.html">Sophia</a></b>, there was money available with which <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> could build up the
armed forces after the loss of Daras. For this perhaps <b><a href="sophia.html">Sophia</a></b> deserves as much if not more credit
than Justin, for she was anxious to maintain the reserves in the treasury, and she scolded <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>
both when he was Caesar and later, when he became emperor after Justin's death, for his lavish
expenditures. However Justin's reward for his fiscal prudence was a reputation for avarice.</p>
<p>Yet he, like <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a> before him, was a builder. 'Being pious,' wrote Theophanes, 'he adorned the
churches built by <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian</b></a>, namely the Great Church, the Holy Apostles, and other churches and
monasteries, granting them plate and a full revenue.'<b><a href="#N_58_">[[58]]</a></b> Theophanes also records his construction
of the Sophianae palace across the Bosporus,<b><a href="#N_59_">[[59]]</a></b> the palace of Deuteron on land he owned before
he became emperor, a church dedicated to SS. Peter and Paul, another church of the Holy
Apostles 'in the Triconch', and an addition to the church of the Virgin at Blachernae which made
it cruciform. Theophanes also mentions repairs to the aqueduct of Valens and a church near Hagia
 Sophia, dedicated to the Theotokos. The cult of the Virgin was tightening its grasp upon the
religious outlook of Constantinople, and she was well on the way to becoming what Athena
Promachos had been to classical Athens: the great divine protectress of her most favored city. </p>
<p>Justin did not forget the west. In the convent of the Holy Cross at Poitiers there is still preserved a
fragment of the 'True Cross' sent to it by Justin and <b><a href="sophia.html">Sophia</a></b>. Diplomacy as well as piety motivated
this gift, for Justin and <b><a href="sophia.html">Sophia</a></b> were anxious to maintain friendly relations with the Franks. In the
Vatican treasury there is a cross with the portraits of Justin and <b><a href="sophia.html">Sophia</a></b> on its arms; it was given to
the pope probably about 568. <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> dream of a restored Roman Empire emerged badly
battered from Justin's reign, but until he lost his reason, he tried to maintain it.</p>
<p>Stories were told of how Justin's favorite amusement, in the madness of his final days, was being
dragged around on a portable throne, and how he used to bite his attendants; one rumor related
that he had eaten two of them. Organ music, played day and night, soothed him. In a moment of
lucidity in December of 574, he appointed <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> Caesar with the name <a href="ticonii.html"><b>Tiberius Constantine</b></a>,
and on the occasion, he made a pathetic address to the new Caesar which is recorded in
Theophanes, Evagrius and John of Ephesus. Edward Gibbon's rendering of it is worth repeating in
part. 'Delight not in blood,' he said, 'abstain from revenge, avoid those actions by which I have
incurred the public hatred, and consult the experience rather than the example of your
predecessor. As a man, I have sinned; as a sinner, even in this life, I have been severely punished;
but these servants (and he pointed to his ministers) who have abused my confidence and inflamed
my passions, will appear with me before the tribunal of Christ '<b><a href="#N_60_">[[60]]</a></b>
  Justin's last rational words will do to sum up his reign.</p>

comparison a spendthrift, is regarded by Gregory as generous and equitable. The <em>Liber
Pontificalis</em> (s.v. Benedict I) however, pays tribute to Justin's generosity to Italy; when Rome was
threatened by famine because of the Lombard invasion, he sent grain from Egypt.

occupied Pannonia Secunda and the Lombards had settled (at Justinian's invitation) north-west of
them on the borders of Noricum.
</p><p><a name="N_25_"></a>[[25]]Procopius, <em>Wars of Justinian</em> 7.34.24. Procopius believed that the Lombards were Catholic (cf.
<em>Wars</em> 6.14.9) but in fact the consensus is that they were Arians, and the Italians who encountered
them when they invaded Italy in 568 considered them pagans. For the view that is generally
accepted, note J. M. Wallace-Hadrill, <em>The Barbarian West: the Early Middle Ages. A. D. 400-1000 </em>(London, 1952; repr. New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1962), p. 54: 'At the time of their
entering Italy, the Lombard chieftains were mostly Arian Christians and their followers either
Arian or pagan.' On this question see Steven C. Fanning, 'Lombard Arianism Reconsidered',
<em>Speculum</em> 52 (1981), pp. 241-258, who argues that Arianism was unimportant among the
Lombards and they, like the Franks, converted from paganism to Catholicism.

</p><p><a name="N_28_"></a>[[28]]The <em>Liber Pontificalis</em> also repeats the popular tradition (also found in Paul the Deacon, <em>Historia
Langobardorum</em> 2.5) that Narses invited the Lombards to invade Italy, but this is improbable: see
Vasiliev, <em>History of the Byzantine Empire</em> I, p. 172. However, Neil Christie, <em>The Lombards</em>
(Oxford, 1995), pp. 61-63, thinks that possibly an imperial diplomatic maneuver to settle the
Lombards as federates on devastated lands in northern Italy may lie behind the story. 
</p><p><a name="N_29_"></a>[[29]]Mango and Scott, eds., <em>The Chronicle of Theophanes the Confessor</em>, p. 360, n.1. Paul the
Deacon, <em>Historia Langobardorum</em> 2.5, relates the fully-developed legend that the Romans sent a
petition to Justin and Sophia asking that Narses be removed, and Justin replaced him as prefect by
Longinus.  Sophia added insults to injury, among them a threat to make him spin wool with her
women, a reference to the fact that Narses was a eunuch. Thereupon Narses retaliated by inviting
the Lombards to invade Italy.

phylarch by Justinian in 531 and entrusted with the defense of the eastern frontier from the
Euphrates to the Red Sea, died in 569 and was succeeded by Mundhir who made two lightning
strikes against the Lakhmids. On the Ghassanids, see Evans, <em>The Age of Justinian</em>, pp. 86-89;

probably reliable here, a Himyarite noble, Abu Murra went to Khusro at Ctesiphon to ask for help
against the Ethiopians but Khusro had no interest in getting involved. Abu Murra lingered for years
in Persian territory. Later his son Ma'dikarib approached the Roman emperor but Rome favored
Ethiopia, which was Christian. He then went to Ctesiphon and found Khusro more receptive.
Himyar remained under Persian control for sixty years.

 in 576.  Sophia's reproaches brought him
back to his senses. Shahid (n. 31), pp. 350-354, argues that the Chalcedonian patriarch of
Antioch, Gregory, was responsible for Justin's suspicions of Mundhir.

</p><p><a name="N_45_"></a>[[45]]Gregory of Tours, 5.19, reports that when Justin became insane, Sophia assumed sole power,
but the people chose Tiberius as Caesar. Theophanes reports for the year A.M. 6067 (574/5) that
Justin adopted Tiberius as his son and proclaimed him Caesar and in 577/8, in a moment of
lucidity, proclaimed Tiberius emperor. See Averil Cameron, 'The Empress Sophia', pp. 15-16; A.

(578/9) reports that Tiberius crowned his wife Ino, renamed Anastasia, Augusta and Sophia was
'stricken in her soul' for, not knowing that he had a wife, she wanted to marry Tiberius and
remain Augusta. Sophia cannot have been unaware that Tiberius was married and had children,
but she may well have hoped to persuade Tiberius to leave his wife and marry her. See Mango and
