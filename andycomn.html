<h3>
<b>Andronicus I Comnenus (A.D. 1183-1185)</b></h3></center>

<center><b>Andrew Stone</b>
<br>University of Western Australia
<p><b>Introduction</b></p></center>

<div><p>The greater part of the life of Andronicus Comnenus, son of the <i>sebastokrator
</i>Isaac
(brother of <b><a href="johncomn.html">John II</a></b>), was spent in competition
with his more fortunate cousin
<b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel I</a></b>,
but what was no more than athletic rivalry in their youth became treasonable
conspiracy. This rivalry weakened the "Comnenian system" in the later years
of the dynasty. Andronicus was a womaniser and an adventurer, and, after
spending some time in prison, roamed the known world once the exposure
of his conspiracies had made it too difficult for him to stay in Byzantium.
The death of<b><a href="mannycom.html"> Manuel </a></b>gave Andronicus the
break that he needed. With the oath he had sworn to protect the boy heir
<b><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius
II</a></b> as a pretext, he presented himself to the populace as the new
emperor's protector, inciting the mob by means of his demagogues. Quickly
disposing of <b><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius</a></b>, he instituted
a reign of terror, no doubt in part calculated to pay back the Byzantine
nobility for the hardships he had suffered, but probably also in part to
ensure that his branch of the Comnenian dynasty would stay in power. Then
again perhaps there was a genuine programme of reform, an effort to curb
the power of the nobles and better the lot of the populace, which was a
reason for him to be demonised by such members of the intelligentsia as
Eustathius of Thessalonica and Nicetas Choniates following his death. In
any case, his popularity with the people rapidly deteriorated, particularly
when the Normans of Sicily captured Durazzo and Thessalonica. He met a
particularly horrible death once the mob had accepted <b><a href="isaaciiang.html">Isaac
II Angelus</a></b> as his successor.
</p></div><center>
<p><b>Conspiracy with the King of Hungary 1155</b></p></center>

<p>John Cinnamus<b><span class="text-2xl"><a href="#N_1_">[[1]]</a></span></b> (and,
more briefly, Nicetas Choniates)<b><a href="#N_2_">[[2]]</a></b> tells
us about Andronicus' first conspiracy, with Géza II, king of Hungary.
Andronicus had been a childhood companion of the future emperor <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel
I</a></b>, indulging in wrestling and racing with him. As a result of <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's</a></b>
regard for him, Andronicus received the governorship of Cilicia (1152)
to prosecute the war against Thoros the Rupenid, although he achieved nothing
of note. Cinnamus claims that the emperor's favouring of his nephew John
Comnenus (the son of one of his elder brothers, the <i>sebastokrator</i>
Andronicus) provoked jealousy in Andronicus and was the root cause of the
rivalry which arose between him and <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></b>,
although <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel </a></b>was to continue to show
much indulgence towards his childhood friend (Choniates, however, attributes
much of the ill-will between Andronicus and <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></b>
to <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></b>, as we shall see below).
<br>&nbsp;
</p><div><p>As a result of this indulgence, Andronicus was granted the governorship
of Nish and Branitshevo (1154-1155). Andronicus had inherited his father's
aspirations to the throne and Cinnamus tells us that Andronicus wrote to
Géza, promising to cede to him Branitshevo and Nish if he would
support his own projected coup d'état. <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></b>,
who was wintering at his camp at Pelagonia, was alerted to the conspiracy,
but did not at first act. Cinnamus claims that Andronicus even considered
a personal attempt on <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's</a></b> life (with
a concealed dagger, while <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></b> was
in his tent at night). <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's</a></b> guards,
however, were alerted and the attempt aborted (Andronicus reportedly pretending
merely to be defecating). It was not in fact until Andronicus' intense
jealousy of <b><a href="johncomn.html">John Comnenus</a></b> was apparent
to <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></b> that he had Andronicus imprisoned
in the Great Palace at Constantinople.
</p></div><center>
<p><b>Andronicus and his first wife</b></p></center>

<div><p>We do not know the name of Andronicus' first wife, nor her nationality
(perhaps Georgian?),<b><a href="#N_3_">[[3]]</a></b> although it is assumed
that she was of noble extraction. She bore Andronicus two sons, Manuel
and John, the latter conceived in prison, as we shall see.
</p></div><center>
<p><b>Andronicus and Eudocia 1155</b></p></center>

<div><p>Apart from Andronicus' jealousy of <b><a href="johncomn.html">John Comnenus</a></b>,
another bone of contention between <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel </a></b>and
Andronicus was the latter's affair with <b><a href="johncomn.html">John
Comnenus'</a></b> sister Eudocia. This, according to Choniates,<b><a href="#N_4_">[[4]]</a></b>
incensed <b><a href="johncomn.html">John</a></b> and other members of his
family, to say nothing of <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></b> himself.
A plot was hatched by Eudocia's relatives to catch Andronicus in bed with
her. Eudocia, learning of the plot, warned Andronicus, and her dashing
lover cut his way out of the side of her tent with a sword and bounded
out of harm's way before his ambushers could act!
</p></div><center>
<p><b>Andronicus' first escape from prison 1158</b></p></center>

<div><p>Once Andronicus' intense envy of <b><a href="johncomn.html">John Comnenus</a></b>
had caused him to be imprisoned, he remained incarcerated in this prison,
a brick building, for a considerable time (1155-1158). However, he discovered
a secret underground passage directly under his cell and hatched a cunning
plan. He lowered himself into the passage, covering his tracks. The guards
arrived to find his cell apparently empty, and made great hue and cry.
Andronicus' wife was accordingly taken prisoner and put in the same cell.
Andronicus emerged from hiding, lay with his wife (leaving her pregnant
with their son John), then, when the guards had relaxed their vigilance,
made good his escape. He managed to travel as far as Melangeia before he
was recaptured.<b><a href="#N_5_">[[5]]</a></b></p></div><center>
<p><b>Andronicus' second escape from prison 1164</b></p></center>

<div><p>Andronicus contrived to escape from confinement in the Great Palace
a second time, six years after his reconfinement, by pretending to be ill.
This obtained him the services of a boy, whom Andronicus instructed to
make a wax impression of the keys to the tower where he was kept. This
was then sent to Andronicus' son Manuel and his wife, who forged duplicate
keys. While the guards were overcome by drink, the boy let Andronicus out,
and he hid in the long grass at the base of the tower until the guards
had given up searching for him. He then made his way to a boat which was
waiting for him under the care of one Chrysocoöpolus. The latter pretended
that Andronicus was his runaway slave, and so Andronicus was able to make
good his escape and take the road towards Galitza (Galicia, a city in the
Ukraine). Although he was apprehended by Vlachs alerted to his escape,
Andronicus feigned gastroenteritis, and then made a mannikin of himself
in the shape of a man defecating. Fooling his Vlach captors in this way,
he once again set out for Galitza. The governor of this city entertained
Andronicus for quite some time.<b><a href="#N_6_">[[6]]</a></b></p></div><center>
<p><b>Andronicus back in favour 1165-6</b></p></center>

<div><p>We find Andronicus back in favour at the siege of Zeugminon in 1165
(see <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel I</a></b>), in command of artillery,
which was largely responsible for breaching the wall of that obdurate Hungarian
city. Next, we find him again as governor (<i>doux</i>) of Cilicia. Andronicus
harboured a personal hatred for his adversary, Thoros. When worsted by
him in battle, Andronicus saw him alone and made an audacious charge at
him, unhorsing him and himself evading the lances of the latter's men.
However, this short period of favour with <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel
</a></b>was
too good to be true, and we soon find Andronicus engaged in another amorous
adventure.
</p></div><center>
<p><b>Andronicus' amorous adventures in the East</b></p></center>

<div><p>Andronicus was bewitched by the comeliness of <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's
</a></b>sister-in-law
Philippa of Antioch,<b><a href="#N_7_">[[7]]</a></b> and deserted his governorship
of Cilicia to indulge in a love-match with her, although she was within
the forbidden degrees of kinship. Choniates dwells on the amorousness of
Andronicus at this phase of his life.<b><a href="#N_8_">[[8]]</a></b> Fearing
<b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></b>,
he soon forsook this lover and took up instead with Theodora, Baldwin III's
widow and daughter of <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's</a></b> brother
Isaac, another forbidden liaison. When <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></b>
wrote to the king of Jerusalem to deliver Andronicus to him, the dispatch
fell into Theodora's hands and Andronicus found it apposite to resume his
wanderings, taking Theodora with him. We are not told precisely where he
roamed, but among the courts which received him was that of Saltuq, the
Turkish emir of Coloneia. However, Theodora and Andronicus' children by
her (Alexius and Irene) fell into Byzantine hands, and Andronicus decided
to try and regain <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's</a></b> favour. He
presented himself to the emperor with a chain around his neck, and <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel
</a></b>wept,
and once more pardoned his errant cousin. Andronicus was exiled to Oeneaeum
on the Black Sea, and he was still there at the time of <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's</a></b>
death.
</p></div><center>
<p><b>Andronicus and Alexius II Porphyrogenitus</b></p></center>

<div><p>The change of fortunes which Andronicus experienced during the rule
of the minor Alexius II Porphyrogenitus (1180-1183), son of <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel,</a></b>
is related in more detail in the article on that emperor. Suffice it to
say here that, under the regency of <b><a href="mannycom.htm#N_xy">Maria
of Antioch</a></b> and her lover the <i>protosebastos</i> Alexius, and
with the failure of the attempted coup by Alexius' elder half-sister Maria
Porphyrogenita and her husband the <i>kaisar</i> Renier of Montferrat,
the populace of Constantinople began to look to Andronicus as their preferred
candidate for the regency. So Andronicus marched on the capital in 1182
from Paphlagonia, refusing attempts by the regents to buy him off. The
<i>protosebastos</i>
was blinded, and the Constantinopolitan mob massacred the Latins present
in the capital, who had enjoyed so much favour under the <i>protosebastos</i>'
régime. Andronicus took measures to consolidate his own position,
marrying his daughter Irene to the boy emperor, poisoning Maria Porphyrogenita
and her husband, having <b><a href="mannycom.htm#N_xy">Maria of Antioch</a></b>
arraigned on a charge of treason and strangled, and finally, once he had
been declared co-emperor with <b><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius</a></b>,
having the boy himself throttled with a bowstring. The reign of terror
had begun.
</p></div><center>
<p><b>Andronicus succeeds to the throne</b></p></center>

<p>Andronicus now married <b><a href="aggiefran.html">Agnes of France</a></b>,
previously Alexius' wife, and lay with her, despite her minority. He rewarded
his supporters with high office. He also obtained release from his oaths
to <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></b> and <b><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius</a></b>
from the incumbent patriarch, Basil Camaterus (August 1183-February 1186),
his own man.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><div><p>As regent Andronicus, although he had had many statues of himself erected,
had gone about the capital dressed as a commoner. Indeed, as emperor he
commissioned a portrait of himself in which he was depicted in a strange
turquoise tunic extending to the buttocks, slit all round, and white boots
up to the knees.<b><a href="#N_9_">[[9]]</a></b> Later he travelled with
a barbarian bodyguard, and spent increasing amounts of time in the suburban
palaces with courtesans, concubines and dancing girls.<b><a href="#N_10_">[[10]]</a></b>
He made fun of the men whom he cuckolded. As his prestige waned, he attempted
to win the favour of the crowd with bloody spectacles, some of which will
be related below.
</p></div><p>At the time Andronicus gained the throne, the generals Andronicus Lapardas
and Alexius Branas were engaged in the struggle against Béla III
of Hungary at Branitshevo and Nish. While <b><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius</a></b>
took the side of the new emperor; Lapardas, however, no doubt fearing for
his life on account of his family connections, had other plans. He made
his way to Adramyttium, with the intention of raising revolt, only to be
apprehended by one of Andronicus' trusted men and blinded. Andronicus,
since he had feared for his ill-gotten throne, upon being apprised of Lapardas'
flight had craftily released letters which said that Lapardas was acting
on his instructions, in this way hoping to prevent any large-scale revolt.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>The spring of 1184 passed peacefully, but revolt did break out among
the inhabitants of Lopadium, Nicaea and Prusa. Alexius Branas and the emperor
himself led their combined armies first against Nicaea, one of whose defenders
was <b><a href="isaaciiang.html">Isaac Angelus</a></b> (to be Andronicus'
sucessor). The city defended itself very capably and resisted the siege-engines
of the imperial forces. Andronicus therefore had <b><a href="isaaciiang.html">Isaac's
</a></b>mother
Euphrosyne brought from Constantinople and put on top of his main battering
ram. This did not, however, deter the defenders, who used their artillery
with a little more care than previously, and who, in fact, were able to
rescue the woman. With the death of Theodore Cantacuzenus, who had made
an attempt on Andronicus' life, the Nicaeans looked to <b><a href="isaaciiang.html">Isaac
Angelus</a></b> to lead them, but he proved irresolute and opened negotiations
with Andronicus. In the meantime the archbishop of the city, Nicholas,
in the face of the lack of food supplies, took matters into his own hands
and led the women and children of the city out in supplication to the emperor.
Andronicus pretended to have compassion on the city, but, once allowed
entry, forced many into exile, and had others brutally cut down.<b><a href="#N_11_">[[11]]</a></b>
<br>&nbsp;
</p><div><p>Andronicus now laid siege to Prusa, which defended itself as valiantly
as Nicaea. The city was under the leadership of the young Theodore Angelus.
However, its wall was breached and Theodore was blinded at the orders of
the emperor, and set on an ass to be carried in whichever direction it
should take him. Theodore's co-defenders Leo Synesius and Manuel Lachanas
were hung on vine-stakes along with forty others and various other men
were cruelly mutilated. There was a general slaughter and the Prusaeans'
animals were seized as booty by Andronicus' forces. Similarly at Lopadium
no mercy was shown, with many impaled and left to rot in the sun.<b><a href="#N_12_">[[12]]</a></b></p></div><center>
<p><b>Isaac Comnenus and Cyprus</b></p></center>

<div><p>The grandson of <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel I's</a></b> elder brother
Isaac, another <b><a href="isaacc.html">Isaac</a></b>, had been captured
by the Turks, but was ransomed upon the pleas of his affines Constantine
Macroducas and Andronicus Ducas. However, this younger <b><a href="isaacc.html">Isaac</a></b>
proved, if we can believe Nicetas Choniates,<b><a href="#N_13_">[[13]]</a></b>
to be even a crueller tyrant and greater lecher than the emperor himself.
<b><a href="isaacc.html">Isaac</a></b>
seized Cyprus as his own kingdom, and the emperor held Constantine Macroducas
and Andronicus Ducas responsible, inciting the mob, through his sinister
henchman Stephen Hagiochristophorites,<b><a href="#N_14_">[[14]]</a></b>
to stone them.
</p></div><center>
<p><b>The flight of Alexius Comnenus to Sicily and the capture of Epidamnus
and Thessalonica</b></p></center>

<p>Alexius Comnenus, who was the nephew of Manuel and his cup-bearer (a
different Alexius Comnenus from the one whose régime Andronicus
had overthrown), was banished by Andronicus to live among the Cumans. Alexius
and a man named Maleinus fled to the court of king William II of Sicily.
At the same time a certain holy man named Alexius Sicundenus was promoting
a pretender who claimed to be the emperor <b><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius
II</a></b>. Upon hearing of this, Andronicus is said to have commented
wryly that Alexius Porphyrogenitus must have been a fine swimmer if he
could surface in Sicily.<b><a href="#N_15_">[[15]]</a></b> In any case,
William saw his chance, mustered an army of 80 000 infantry and select
cavalry (5000 horse)<b><a href="#N_16_">[[16]]</a></b>, and a fleet of
200 sail, and dispatched these forces under Count Baldwin and Count Richard
of Acerra (who were in command of the army) and Tancred of Lecce (in charge
of the navy) to the Balkan peninsula. Epidamnus (Durazzo) was taken without
a blow (24 June 1185), and then the Normans marched on and laid siege to
Thessalonica (the infantry arriving on 6 August 1185, the navy on 15 August).
The local governor was the less than manly and incompetent David Comnenus,
who lived in fear of and in rivalry with his imperial master.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><div><p>The siege of the city of Thessalonica is the subject of a <i>syngraphe</i>,
or short history, by its metropolitan bishop, Eustathius of Thessalonica.
He relates how even women and clergy helped to defend the city, which was
attacked primarily from the direction of the eastern wall. When the city
capitulated (24 August 1185), the Sicilian Normans plundered every abode
and there was a wholesale slaughter of the inhabitants, leaving 7000 Greeks
dead; those who sought sanctuary in the churches did so to no avail. Indeed,
Eustathius,<b><a href="#N_17_">[[17]]</a></b> supported by Nicetas Choniates<b><a href="#N_18_">[[18]]</a></b>,
says that the sanctuaries were desecrated, the icons trampled on, altars
danced on, and sanctuary floors urinated on by the Norman profaners. The
survivors of the massacre were shamefully treated by their new masters,
and both Choniates and Eustathius describe the indignities to which the
surviving Thessalonians were subjected. Eustathius had to find 4000 gold
pieces as a ransom.<b><a href="#N_19_">[[19]]</a></b> He had elected to
remain in Thessalonica and share the sufferings of his flock, and, with
his eloquence, he interceded for it.<b><a href="#N_20_">[[20]]</a></b></p></div><center>
<p><b>The plot of the Sebastianus brothers and Andronicus' reign of terror</b></p></center>

<p>Andronicus had the Sebastianus brothers hung for conspiring to raise
to the throne yet another Alexius Comnenus, this time the illegitimate
son of <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel I </a></b>by his niece Theodora.
This Alexius had married Andronicus' daughter Irene; the marriage was dissolved
and Alexius blinded and put in the fortress of Chele<b><a href="#N_21_">[[21]]</a></b>
Among Alexius' household a certain Mamalus was consigned to flames as one
of the spectacles in the Hippodrome.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><div><p>George Dishypatus, one of the lectors of the Great Church, who was on
the point of being roasted alive on a spit, was reprieved only by the news
of the capture of Durazzo by the Normans, which Andronicus interpreted
as divine disapproval for his cruel punishments.<b><a href="#N_22_">[[22]]</a></b>
This did not, however, stop him from having Constantine Tripsychus (see
<b><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius
II</a></b>) being blinded. Andronicus felt so insecure on his throne that
even past henchmen and women could be the victims of his wrath.
</p></div><center>
<p><b>Andronicus' acts of philanthropy</b></p></center>

<div><p>Andronicus, however, was not totally devoid of redeeming characteristics.
He was an impartial judge in suits between the nobility and poor, even
judging against his own man Theodore Dadibrenus.<b><a href="#N_23_">[[23]]</a></b>
Furthermore he would occasionally give to the poor, and, even more remarkably,
curbed the excesses of imperial tax collectors in the provinces.<b><a href="#N_24_">[[24]]</a></b>
He stopped the sale of public offices and awarded them on merit. We have
already seen how Andronicus tried to curb the power of the nobility. He
also ordered that the underground aqueduct bringing fresh water from the
Hydrales River be rebuilt.<b><a href="#N_25_">[[25]]</a></b> Finally, he
forbade the plundering of the cargoes of wrecked ships.<b><a href="#N_26_">[[26]]</a></b></p></div><center>
<p><b>The Normans advance</b></p></center>

<div><p>The Sicilian Normans, after they had taken Thessalonica, divided their
forces into three parts: one remained at Thessalonica, one advanced on
Serrai, and the third marched on Constantinople itself, camping at Mosynopolis.
Andronicus sent an army of four divisions against this threat, one division
being under the command of his son John. Only Theodore Chumnus dared to
lead his division against the Normans, quickly beating a retreat.
<br>Andronicus, for his part, inspected the fortifications of the city,
and gave orders for those parts which had fallen into disrepair to be strengthened,
but he nevertheless continued to pursue his usual life of sensual pleasure
with courtesans and concubines, resorting to aphrodisiacs in an effort
to be equal to the task.<b><a href="#N_27_">[[27]]</a></b></p></div><center>
<p><b>Andronicus fears for his throne</b></p></center>

<div><p>There now came a point where the Norman menace could not be ignored,
and the Constantinopolitans became restive. Andronicus now felt even more
insecure, and with the collaboration of one of his chief ministers, the
bloodthirsty Stephen Hagiochristophorites, decided to decree that all those
imprisoned for seditious intent be put to death. Not even his son, the
<i>sebastokrator</i>
Manuel, could condone this. Andronicus now consulted a water-divining oracle
to see who would succeed him. The oracular response, a crescent-shaped
sigma and behind it an iota formed in the waters, therefore seemed to suggest
someone of the christian name Isaac. Andronicus assumed that Isaac Comnenus,
despot of Cyprus, was meant by this, and heaped scorn on his judge of the
<i>velum</i>
John Apotyras for even thinking that <b><a href="isaaciiang.html">Isaac
Angelus</a></b> could be the one intended (Andronicus considering <b><a href="isaaciiang.html">Isaac
Angelus</a></b> as somewhat effeminate). Nevertheless Stephen Hagiochristophorites
thought that Angelus should be put to death all the same, and went to his
house to effect his arrest, putting into motion the chain of events that
lead to Andronicus' overthrow. The date was 11 September 1185.<b><a href="#N_28_">[[28]]</a></b></p></div><center>
<p><b>Isaac Angelus' coup</b></p></center>

<div><p>Faced with death, <b><a href="isaaciiang.html">Isaac Angelus</a></b>
chose to fight. Indeed, he cut Stephen Hagiochristophorites down, and rode
to the Great Church to seek sanctuary. At this stage, <b><a href="isaaciiang.html">Isaac
</a></b>was
concerned only about his life. However, the populace of Constantinople,
which had been whipped into a frenzy by Andronicus so many times, now began
to look to <b><a href="isaaciiang.html">Isaac</a></b> to overthrow Andronicus'
tyrannical régime. The mob broke the keys and bolts to the prisons,
released the prisoners, and began to arm themslves, now openly declaring<b><a href="isaaciiang.html">
Isaac</a></b> emperor. Isaac was somewhat bemused at these happenings,
even when the crown of <b><a href="conniei.html">Constantine</a></b> was
set on his head by one of the sacristans of the Great Church. Now that
his life was no longer under threat, he left the Great Church in the company
of Basil Camaterus, the patriarch, who was acting under duress from the
crowd.&nbsp; Andronicus, apprised of these happenings, took refuge in the
Great Palace, at first defending himself with a few men and his own arrows.
When it became apparent that he could not prevail he offered to set aside
the imperial dignity in favour of his son Manuel, an offer which incensed
the mob even further. Andronicus therefore fled, boarding a galley and
taking with him his wife <b><a href="aggiefrance.html">Agnes (of France),</a></b>
and his concubine Maraptike, headed for Russia.<b><a href="#N_29_">[[29]]</a><a href="isaaciiang.html">Isaac</a></b>
entered the Great Palace and was acclaimed emperor by the populace, which
took the opportunity to plunder it, even desecrating the shrines it contained.<b><a href="isaaciiang.html">
Isaac</a></b> gave orders for Andronicus to be apprehended.<b><a href="#N_30_">[[30]]</a></b></p></div><center>
<p><b>The capture and death of Andronicus</b></p></center>

<div><p>Andronicus arrived at Chele, from which he intended to take ship for
Russia. However, his attempts to cross were thwarted by adverse winds.
As a result he was captured, and his attempts to win the sympathy of his
captors through lamentations failed. He was confined in the prison of Anemas.
Then he was paraded in front of the new emperor <b><a href="isaaciiang.html">Isaac</a></b>.
His beard was torn out, his head shaved, teeth pulled out and he was made
the sport of those who were present, being battered even by women whose
husbands he had executed or had blinded. Finally, his right hand was cut
off with an axe, and several days later one of his eyes was gouged out
and he was seated on a camel and paraded in the marketplace. Further indignities
followed, including blows on the head from clubs and befouling of his nostrils
with cow dung and the like. He was pelted with stones and one prostitute
poured a pot of hot water over his face. He was led into the arena, and
suspended by his feet. Despite all these indignities, however, Andronicus
held up bravely and remained in possession of his senses. Worse followed,
with assaults on his genitals and the thrust of a sword down his throat,
and further wounds, the result of which was an agonising death.<b><a href="#N_31_">[[31]]</a></b>
The Constantinopolitan populace had by now had their fill of Andronicus'
tyranny and cruelty.
</p></div><center>
<p><b>Character and Legacy</b></p></center>

<p>Andronicus was a physically impressive specimen, tall, muscular, comely
and eloquent. But it need hardly be said that he was not only a philanderer,
but one of the most bloodthirsty tyrants to sit on the Byzantine throne.
Eustathius and Nicetas Choniates both lived through the sack of a major
city: Eustathius that of Thessalonica, Choniates that of Constantinople
itself. They therefore interpreted such dire events as the result of divine
wrath directed at an unjust reign (so Eustathius) or reigns (in the case
of Choniates). Andronicus' transgressions of Byzantine ethical codes gave
them plenty of scope for criticism. What then do we make of Andronicus'
reforms in the collecting of taxes and his courting of the mob? Two scholars
(other than Brand) who have studied the reign are Cognasso and Danstrup
(see bibliography). Cognasso saw in Andronicus two conflicting personalities,
one patriotic and reforming (as we have suggested), the other fiercely
opposed to <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's</a></b> branch of the Comnenian
dynasty. Danstrup, a little more cynically, sees all measures taken by
Andronicus, including the reforms, as designed to keep himself and his
immediate family on the throne. Magdalino wonders whether Andronicus' behaviour
was the product of his unequal rivalry with his cousin <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel
I</a></b>. Brand, writing before Magdalino, prefers Danstrup's mode of
assessment. However we should qualify this argument: it should always be
remembered that Andronicus did in fact have a good claim by birth to be
the legitimate emperor. We might conclude with Nicetas' verdict, that if
Andronicus had not been so bloodthirsty, his more philanthropic acts might
perhaps have ensured that he be remembered as not the least of the Comneni.<b><a href="#N_32_">[[32]]</a></b>
