<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>From A.D. 253 to 260, <b><a href="gallval.html">Valerian</a></b> ruled the Roman Empire together with his son
<a href="gallval.html"><b>Gallienus</b></a>. At the end of the fifties, <a href="gallval.html"><b>Valerian</b></a> launched an attack against the
Persians, but was captured in A.D. 260. Persians invaded 
the eastern Roman provinces, producing chaos. In turn, provincials tried to help 
themselves by choosing their own emperors --effectively rebelling-- not 
only in the east but also in Gaul and in the Danube region, where 
Germanic tribes invaded. It took some time before <a href="gallval.html"><b>Gallienus</b></a> was
able to regain power. It was not until the reign of <a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian</b></a> that the
Gallic and the Palmyrene empires were reconquered.</p>

<p>One major problem in dealing with the rebellions of the early sixties is the scarcity
of sources: evidence is meagre and scattered, dating only from late antiquity or
even the Byzantine period. The most extensive source is the anonymous <em>Historia
Augusta</em>, a collection of imperial biographies dating probably from the late fourth
century. But this work contains many inventions and distortions, and the part on the
usurpers under <a href="gallval.html"><b>Gallienus</b></a>, called <em>Tyranni triginta</em>, is particularly notorious.Some of the persons listed in this book are complete fabrications; some 
existed but did not rebel against <a href="gallval.html"><b>Gallienus</b></a>. Most of the details on the lives and characters of even the
usurpers are invented. Therefore, it is quite difficult to single out the historical
facts on the rebellions under <a href="gallval.html"><b>Gallienus</b></a>.</p>
<p><strong>1. Usurpers at the Danube Frontier: <a href="ingen.html"><b>Ingenuus</b></a> and <a href="Regalia.html"><b>Regalianus</b></a></strong></p>
<p><a name="Note 2"></a><strong>2. Usurpers in the east: The Macriani and Ballista</strong></p>
<p>The Macriani are Macrianus senior and his sons Macrianus iunior and Quietus. The
origins of their family are unknown.<a href="#N_1_"><b>[[1]]</b></a> They revolted after Valerianus was defeated
and captured by the Persians, A.D. 260.<a href="#N_2_"><b>[[2]]</b></a>  T.(?) Fulvius Macrianus (senior) made an equestrian military career under
<a href="gallval.html"><b>Valerian</b></a>.<a href="#N_3_"><b>[[3]]</b></a> He was married to a wife of noble origin, possibly named Iunia.<a href="#N_4_"><b>[[4]]</b></a> He served as <em>a rationibus Augusti</em> in Egypt under Valerian, and is said to
have instigated the persecution against the Christians in this province.<a href="#N_5_"><b>[[5]]</b></a> Later, he
accompanied the emperor Valerian on his Persian campaign as <em>procurator arcae et
praepositus annonae in expeditione Persica</em>.<a href="#N_6_"><b>[[6]]</b></a> According to Eusebius, he betrayed
Valerian.<a href="#N_7_"><b>[[7]]</b></a></p>

<p>When <a href="gallval.html"><b>Valerian</b></a> was captured by the Persians in A.D. 260, his son <a href="gallval.html"><b>Gallienus</b></a>,
coregent already since A.D. 253, became sole emperor. But he was far away in the
west. Therefore, in response to the military catastrophe, the eastern army
chose their own emperor. The pretorian prefect Ballista proposed
Macrianus senior as the new ruler. But Macrianus refused the honor because of his
old age and his fragile state of health.<b><a href="#N_8_">[[8]]</a></b> His two sons Macrianus iunior and Quietus
were proclaimed instead, before 17 September 260.<a href="#N_9_"><b>[[9]]</b></a> Two factors
 were important for the usurpation of the Macriani. As <em>procurator arcae
et praepositus annonae</em>, Macrianus senior had control over the treasure of
<a href="gallval.html"><b>Valerian</b></a>: therefore, the usurpers were able to mint coins. On the other
hand, the praetorian prefect Ballista defeated the Persians after
<a href="gallval.html"><b>Valerian's</b></a> capture. This helped to legitimate the claim for power of the
Macriani.<a href="#N_10_"><b>[[10]]</b></a></p>

<p>T. Fulvius Iunius Macrianus (iunior) and T. Fulvius Iunius Quietus were the sons of
Macrianus senior and of a noble mother. According to the
<em>Historia Augusta</em>, they both served as military tribunes under <a href="gallval.html"><b>Valerian</b></a>, but this
information is to be dismissed as fictitious.<a href="#N_11_"><b>[[11]]</b></a> When they had been proclaimed
emperors, gold and silver coins were minted in their names.<a href="#N_12_"><b>[[12]]</b></a> Some of these, bearing
the reverse legends <em>Fides Militum</em>, <em>Fortuna Redux</em>, <em>Marti Propugnatori</em>, <em>Soli Invicto</em>,
<em>Victoria Augg.</em>, honor the army and proclaim confidence of victory. Other coins
proclaim the beginning of a new and prosperous rule in the Roman Empire: <em>Romae Aeternae</em>,
<em>Spes Publica</em>, <em>Indulgentiae Aug.</em>, <em>Aequitas Augg.</em>, <em>Pietas Aug</em>. Macrianus iunior and
Quietus also became consuls.</p>

<p>Their rule won recognition in the east of the Empire and in Egypt.<a href="#N_13_"><b>[[13]]</b></a> Sooner or
later, the Macriani had to face <a href="gallval.html"><b>Gallienus</b></a>, who still controlled Italy and the
Balkans. Therefore, Macrianus father and son marched westwards, while Quietus
and Ballista stayed in the east to secure control over this region.<a href="#N_14_"><b>[[14]]</b></a> In the autumn
of A.D. 261, the Macriani were defeated by <a href="postumus.htm#Note_AA"><b>Aureolus</b></a> or <a href="dom.html"><b>Domitianus</b></a> in Illyricum (near
the border of Thrace) and killed by their own soldiers.<a href="#N_15_"><b>[[15]]</b></a> After this defeat, Quietus 
lost control of the east, while <a href="zenobia.html"><b>Odaenathus of Palmyra</b></a>
gained power. Together with Ballista, Quietus retreated to Emesa, where he was
killed by the inhabitants of the city.<a href="#N_16_"><b>[[16]]</b></a></p>

<p>Ballista appears in the sources also under the name of "Callistus".<a href="#N_17_"><b>[[17]]</b></a> He was the
prefect of the guard (<em>praefectus praetorio</em>) under the Macriani, perhaps also under
<a href="gallval.html"><b>Valerian</b></a>.<a href="#N_18_"><b>[[18]]</b></a> As <em>praefectus equitum</em>, he defeated the Persians after they had
captured <a href="gallval.html"><b>Valerian</b></a>.<a herf="#N_19_"><b>[[19]]</b></a> Afterwards, he played a crucial role in the rebellion of the
Macriani.<a href="#N_20_"><b>[[20]]</b></a>  In the autumn of A.D. 261, he was in Emesa with Quietus. According to the <em>Historia
Augusta</em>, he was proclaimed emperor after the death of Quietus, but this seems to be
one of the many inventions of the anonymous author.<a href="#N_21_"><b>[[21]]</b></a> He was put to death by
<a href="zenobia.html"><b>Odaenathus of Palmyra</b></a>.<a href="#N_22_"><b>[[22]]</b></a></p>
<p>In the thirteenth book of the <em>Oracula Sibyllina</em>, a source contemporary to the events,
we may have an interesting allusion to Macrianus senior and Ballista: "With great and
reckless courage he (i.e. the "sun-sent, dreadful, fearsome lion, breathing much fire")
will destroy the well-horned swift stag and the great, venom-spitting, fearsome
beast discharging many shafts and the bow-footed goat ..."<a href="#N_23_"><b>[[23]]</b></a> According to Potter,
the lion is <a href="zenobia.html"><b>Odaenathus of Palmyra</b></a>, the stag Macrianus, the beast Shapur (the Great King
of Persia) and the goat Ballista.<a href="#N_24_"><b>[[24]]</b></a></p>
<p>The revolt of the Macriani resulted from the fact that the emperor <a href="gallval.html"><b>Valerian</b></a> was
caught by the Persians and that his son and coregent, <a href="gallval.html"><b>Gallienus</b></a>, was far away in the
west. The soldiers of the eastern army and the people of the eastern provinces were
looking for a new emperor who would save them from the Persian threat.<a href="#N_25_"><b>[[25]]</b></a>
Macrianus senior and Ballista had won reputation because of their victories over
the Persians. They also had control over <a href="gallval.html"><b>Valerian's</b></a> war-chest.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Note 3"></a>3. Usurpers in Achaea: Valens and Piso</strong></p>
<p>Valens, with the <em>cognomen</em> "Thessalonicus", was governor of the province Achaea
(and maybe also Macedonia) under <a href="gallval.html"><b>Gallienus</b></a>.<a href="#N_26_"><b>[[26]]</b></a> When the Macriani marched
westward, they had to deal with those governors like Valens who tried
to stay loyal to <a href="gallval.html"><b>Gallienus</b></a>. Therefore, Macrianus senior sent Piso  to
Greece to take care of Valens. Valens' troops reacted by proclaiming their governor
emperor, probably in A.D. 261.  Since the problematic <em>Historia Augusta</em> is our only source for <strong>Piso</strong>, we cannot be sure
about the reliability of all the reports.<a href="#N_27_"><b>[[27]]</b></a> He is said to have stemmed from the <em>gens
Calpurnia</em>, a noble consular family which had family ties to Cicero in the late
republic.<a href="#N_28_"><b>[[28]]</b></a> Being a man of severe Roman virtues, he is said to have received the
<em>cognomen</em> "Frugi". When Piso reached Thessaly, he tried to become emperor himself
(probably in A.D. 261). According to the <em>Historia Augusta</em>, he assumed the name
"Thessalicus", probably a confusion with Valens "Thessalonicus" (see above).<a href="#N_29_"><b>[[29]]</b></a> He
was killed by the soldiers of Valens.  This <em>senatus consultum</em>  obviously forged by the anonymous
author of the <em>Historia Augusta</em> consecrated Piso and granted him a statue.<a href="#N_30_"><b>[[30]]</b></a> Valens himself met death by the hands of his
own soldiers.  The events in Greece are very obscure. Why was Valens proclaimed emperor? Did he
try to stay loyal to <a href="gallval.html"><b>Gallienus</b></a>, and was he forced to accept the purple by his troops?
Is Piso's rebellion an invention by the anonymous author of the <em>Historia Augusta</em>? At
least, it is certain that Achaea and Macedonia were drawn into the conflict between
the Macriani and <a href="gallval.html"><b>Gallienus</b></a>.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Note 4"></a>4. Usurpers in Egypt: Mussius Aemilianus and Memor</strong></p>
<p>The career of L. Mussius Aemilianus (<i>signo</i> Aegippius), perhaps of Italic origin,<a href="#N_31_"><b>[[31]]</b></a>
is known from an inscription. He was of equestrian rank, served as <em>praefectus
vehiculorum trium provinciarum Galliarum</em> (probably under <a href="philarab.html"><b>Philip the Arab</b></a>, i.e. A.D.
244-249), <em>procurator Alexandreae Pelusi Paraetoni</em>, <em>procurator portus utriusque Ostiae</em>
(A.D. 247), vice-prefect of Egypt (at the end of the fifties), and finally prefect of
Egypt (A.D. 259-261).<a href="#N_32_"><b>[[32]]</b></a> He was responsible for the implementation of <a href="gallval.html"><b>Valerian's</b></a>
laws against the Christians.<a href="#N_33_"><b>[[33]]</b></a></p>
<p>Mussius supported the usurpation of the Macriani. When their revolt broke down, Mussius himself seems to have been proclaimed emperor in Egypt. Having
compromised himself by supporting the Macriani, he did not have any other choice
than to rebel against <a href="gallval.html"><b>Gallienus</b></a>. <a href="gallval.html"><b>Gallienus</b></a> sent troops under the command of
Aurelius Theodotus who defeated Mussius before the 30<sup>th</sup> March 262. The usurper was
executed.  Memor came from northern Africa.<a href="#N_34_"><b>[[34]]</b></a> He was in charge of guaranteeing the food
supply from Egypt, and is said to have prepared a rebellion. Theodotus'
soldiers killed him (probably in A.D. 262), before he was proclaimed emperor.
Schwartz tried to identify him with Mussius Aemilianus, but not successfully.<a href="#N_35_"><b>[[35]]</b></a>
  In both cases, it is not certain whether Aemilianus and Memor really tried to become
emperors themselves, or whether they were killed because they supported the
Macriani.<a href="#N_36_"><b>[[36]]</b></a></p>
<p><a href="postumus.htm#Note_AA"><strong>5. Aureolus</strong></a></p>
<p><strong><a name="Note 5"></a>6. Fictitious usurpers: Trebellianus, Celsus and Saturninus</strong></p>
<p>During the sole reign of <a href="gallval.html"><b>Gallienus</b></a> (A.D. 260-268), Trebellianus is said to have been
proclaimed emperor in Isauria (Asia minor).<a href="#N_37_"><b>[[37]]</b></a> According to the <em>Historia Augusta</em>, he
also had control over Cilicia, but was defeated and killed by Camsisoleus, <em>dux
Gallieni</em>, an Egyptian and brother of Theodotus who defeated Mussius Aemilianus. However, scholarly consensus holds that the whole story was invented by the
 author of the <em>Historia Augusta</em>.<a href="#N_38_"><b>[[38]]</b></a>
Trebellianus is also mentioned in the <em>Breviarium</em> of Eutropius (earlier than the
<em>Historia Augusta</em>), but the passage is probably a later interpolation, inspired by the
<em>vita</em> in the <em>Historia Augusta</em>.<a href="#N_39_"><b>[[39]]</b></a></p>
<p>According to the <em>Historia Augusta</em>, Celsus, a <em>privatus</em> and ex-tribune, lived in Africa
on his estates. Because of his justice and his tall stature, he was proclaimed emperor
by Vibius Passienus, the proconsul of Africa, and Fabius Pomponianus, the <em>dux limitis
Libyci</em>, and was invested with the cloth of the <em>dea Caelestis</em>. After only seven
days, a certain Galliena, a relative of Gallienus, is said to have killed him. His body
was thrown to the dogs. The rebellion and the persons involved are obviously
invented.<a href="#N_40_"><b>[[40]]</b></a></p>
<p>Saturninus, not to be confused with the usurper of the same name under <a href="probus.html"><b>Probus</b></a>,
appears in the <em>Historia Augusta</em> as <em>optimus ducum Gallieni temporis</em>. He is said to have
been proclaimed emperor by the troops and to have been killed later by his own
soldiers, because he was too severe. Obviously, he is as fictitious as Trebellianus and
Celsus.<a href="#N_41_"><b>[[41]]</b></a></p>

40f. The earliest Egyptian papyrus mentioning the Macriani as emperors is <em>Pap. Oxy.</em>
XLIX, 3476, ll. 12f., dated 17 September 260; the last one is dated  30 October 261
(<em>Pap. Strasb.</em> I, 6, ll. 37f.). Gallienus is first mentioned again in a document from 30<sup>th</sup>
March 262. Therefore, the rebellion of the Macriani collapsed between October
261 and March 262.</p>

<p><a name="N_3_"></a>[[3]] SHA, <em>Tyr. trig.</em> 10.14; 12.1; 13.3. Pflaum (1960, p. 930) dismisses the whole account as
fictional. The details of the military career reported in SHA, <em>Tyr. trig.</em> 12.17 are to be
dismissed: Stein, 1910, col. 260.</p>

<p><a name="N_4_"></a>[[4]] Cf. SHA, <em>Tyr. trig.</em> 13.3. Because the younger son Quietus bears the
name Iunius, scholars think that his mother, i. e., Macrianus' wife, came from a <em>gens
Iunia</em>: cf. Stein, 1910, col. 260.</p>

<p><a name="N_5_"></a>[[5]] Euseb., <em>hist. eccl.</em> 7.10.4-7, citing Dionysius of Alexandria; Stein (1910, col. 260) dismisses the title as being

inspired by the <em>comes largitionum</em> of late antiquity and therefore anachronistic if
used for the third century (Stein, 1910, col. 260; Alföldi, 1937, p. 61, n. 58). See for the

towards Macrianus, the instigator of the persecutions in Egypt.</p>

depend on the Athenian historian Dexippus (third century).</p>

<p><a name="N_17_"></a>[[17]] According to Hanslik (1964, col. 817) and Kienast (1996, p. 227), "Callistus" was
the real name, "Ballista" being a nickname. Potter (1990, p. 343) thinks that Ballista
bore both names. (In the <em>Oracula Sibyllina</em> 13, 169 is a play on the name of Ballista with
the Greek: cf. Potter, <i>loc. cit</i>.) But Henze (1896, col. 2831) and Birley (1997,
col. 425) think that "Ballista" was the real name, "Callistus" being an error, as is
also convincingly argued by Bleckmann (1992, p. 117).</p>

<p><a name="N_25_"></a>[[25]] <i>Cf</i>. also Hartmann, 1982, pp. 160f. Under the pressure of the barbarian and
Persian invasions of the third century and the need for quick decisions, soldiers and provincials wanted their
emperors to be near them, as is also shown by the rebellions of Pacatianus and
Iotapianus under Philip the Arab.</p>

<p><a name="N_26_"></a>[[26]] Sources for Valens: Amm. 21.16.10; <em>Epit. de Caes.</em> 32.4; SHA, <em>Gall.</em> 2.2-4; <em>Tyr. trig.</em> 19-21. <em>Cognomen</em> 
"Thessalonicus": Amm. 21.16.10. Sträussler (1948, col. 2138) and Kienast
(1996, p. 227) therefore think that Valens may have been proclaimed in Thessalonica.
Valens is said to have had an uncle of the same name (Valens), who also had
instigated a rebellion (SHA, <em>Tyr. trig.</em> 20). This story probably is an invention: cf.
Barbieri, 1952, p. 407; Ziegler, in: Straub, 1985, p. 359, n. 2; see also Sträussler, 1948,
col. 2138. For the possible identification with a Valentinus, known from the
Continuator Dionis, cf. M. Lambertz, <i>s.v</i>. "Valentinus no. 2," <i>RE</i> VII.A, 1948, col. 2273.</p>

<p><a name="N_27_"></a>[[27]] Sources for Piso: SHA, <em>Gall.</em> 2.1-4; <em>Tyr. trig.</em> 19.2; 21. For the question of reliability: Stein, 1936, p. 72; Stein, 1943, p. 217; Jones etc., 1971, p. 703; Hartmann, 1982,
p. 98, n. 5; Ziegler, in: Straub, 1985, p. 359, n. 1. See for the question also Kienast, 1996,
p. 226; Wachtel, 1998, p. 167. Barbieri (1952, p. 263) leaves the question open. Klass
(1950, col. 1803-1805) certainly goes too far in rejecting the course of events as
reported in the <em>Historia Augusta</em>, but accepting everything reported
about Piso's character: the anonymous author likes to invent character studies of
the emperors and usurpers. Too much trust in the <em>Historia Augusta</em> is also to be found
in Sträussler, 1948, col. 2138.</p>

22,1-8. The course of events as narrated in <em>Tyranni triginta</em>, where Aemilianus appears
as a new Alexander preparing a campaign against India, is certainly fictitious (<i>cf</i>.

1971, p. 922. According to Hohl (<i>loc. cit</i>.) and Syme (<i>loc. cit</i>.), the anonymous author
constructed the name  Trebellianus" after the (also fictitious!) pseudonym he assumed
for the authorship of the <em>Vita</em> of the <em>Tyranni triginta</em>,  Trebellius Pollio".</p>

<p><a name="N_39_"></a>[[39]] Eutr. 9.8. That the passage is interpolated is argued by Stein, 1937, col. 2262 (with
further literature), and Kienast, 1996, p. 229. Ziegler (in: Straub, 1985, pp. 350f., n. 1; p.
364, n. 1) on the other hand thinks that  Trebellianus" in Eutropius could be a mistake
for  Regalianus", and that the anonymous author of the <em>Historia Augusta</em> invented the
usurper Trebellianus after the misspelled  Trebellianus" he found in Eutropius.</p>
