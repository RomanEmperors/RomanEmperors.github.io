<a href="olybrius.jpg"><img src="/olybrius.jpg" alt="A coin of Olybrius (c)1998, Princeton Economic Institute"></a>

<h3>SOURCES</h3>



   <p>Most of the sources that mention the emperor Anicius Olybrius deal with his life before

he became emperor.  Summaries of his brief reign, during which scarcely any of his

activities are known, are limited primarily to brief notices of his accession and death. 

The best of the bare-bones accounts of his life are provided by the <i>Fasti vindobonenses

priores</i> and John of Antioch.</p>



               <h3>FAMILY BACKGROUND AND EARLY HISTORY</h3>



   <p>Olybrius probably was a scion of the family of Anicius Hermogenianus Olybrius,

consul in 395, whose wife was named Anicia Juliana; both, therefore, were members of

the powerful Anician family of Italy.  <i>Circa</i> 454 Olybrius married Placidia, the younger

daughter of <a href="valenIII.html"><b>Valentinian III</b></a>

 and <a href="eudox.html"><b>Licinia Eudoxia</b></a>, and the sister of Eudocia.  The marriage

may reflect an effort by <a href="valenIII.html"><b>Valentinian III</b></a>

to solidify an alliance with the Italian senatorial

aristocracy as part of his effort to assert his own authority vis-á-vis that of powerful

generals such as Fl. Aëtius.  <a href="valenIII.html"><b>Valentinian's</b></a>

murder of Aëtius in 454, however, was

followed by his own assassination in March of 455, and the seizure of the throne by

<a href="petmax.html"><b>Petronius Maximus</b></a>.

</p>

   <p>Two months later the Vandals captured and sacked Rome.  The Byzantine chronicler

Malalas reported, </p>



          <p>"Gaiseric came suddenly to Rome with his forces and captured the city...  He

     even led away as captives surviving senators, along with their wives; along

     with them he also carried off to Carthage in Africa the empress Eudoxia,

     who had summoned him, her daughter Placidia, the wife of the patrician

     Olybrius, who then was staying at Constantinople, and even the maiden

     Eudocia.  After he had returned, Gaiseric gave the younger Eudocia, a

     maiden, the daughter of the empress Eudoxia, to his son Huneric in

     marriage, and he held them both, the mother and the daughter, in great

     honor" (<i>Chron</i>. 366).</p>



<p algn="left">Olybrius, therefore, escaped the sack, but suffered the distress of seeing his wife carried

off to Carthage.</p>   



   <p>The little that is known about Olybrius' personal concerns suggests that he had a great

interest in religion.  During his stay in Constantinople, for example, he visited Daniel the

Stylite, who foretold <a href="eudox.html"><b>Eudoxia's</b></a> return from captivity in Africa.  And it may have been at

this time that he wrote to his wife's grandmother, the eastern empress <a href="https://www.salve.edu/~dimaiom/eudoc.html"><b>Eudocia</b></a>, at Jerusalem

 advising her to forsake Eutychianism.</p>



  <p> After the death of the western emperor <a href="major.html"><b>Majorian</b></a> 

in 461, Gaiseric supported Olybrius as

a candidate for the western throne.  The contemporary Byzantine historian Priscus noted,  </p>





          <p>"Gaiseric, although many embassies had been sent to him at different times,

     did not dismiss the women until he had betrothed the elder daughter of

     Valentinian (Eudocia was her name) to his son Huneric.  Then he sent back

     Eudoxia, the daughter of Theodosius II, with Placidia, her other daughter,

     whom Olybrius had married.  Gaiseric did not cease from ravaging Italy

     and Sicily, but pillaged them the more, desiring that, after Majorian,

     Olybrius would be emperor of the Romans of the west by reason of his

     kinship by marriage" (<i>fr</i>.29: Gordon trans., p.118). </p>



<p>John of Antioch provides some additional information:

</p>

          <p>"Gaiseric ravaged the lands of Italy wanting Olybrius to be emperor of the

     west because of his relationship by marriage.  He did not make the obvious

     pretext for the war the fact that Olybrius had not become the ruler of the

     west, but rather that he had not been given the property of Valentinian and

     Aëtius.  He demanded this partly in the name of Eudocia, whom his son had married,

     and partly because Gaudentius, Aëtius' son, was living with him" (<i>fr.</i>204: Gordon

     trans., pp.119-120)</p>

<p>Gaiseric's demands, of course, came to nought, for <a href="libius.html"><b>Libius Severus (461-465)</b></a> was named

western emperor by the barbarian general Ricimer.

</p>

   <p>The return of the imperial women was also reported by Malalas, who mistakenly placed

it during the reign of Marcian:</p>



          "During his reign the empresses Eudoxia and Placidia returned to their

     families at Constantinople, and Olybrius once again had for himself his

     wife Placidia, who bore Juliana to him at Constantinople"(<i>Chron</i>. 368).



<p>Olybrius and Placidia, therefore, remained in the east with their daughter Anicia Juliana,

who would have been born in the mod 460s.  In 464, he was named <i>consul posterior</i> with

Fl. Rusticus.  Both consuls were appointed by the eastern emperor <a href="leo1.html"><b>Leo</b></a>, given that <a href="leo1.html"><b>Leo</b></a>

did not recognize <a href="libius.html"><b>Severus</b></a>,

 and it may be that Olybrius, as an Italian, filled the "western"

slot.  Olybrius' religious interests continued to manifest themselves as he and Placidia

renovated the church of St. Euphemia at Constantinople, which had been founded by

Placidia's mother <a href="eudox.html"><b>Eudoxia.</b></a></p>  



   <p>Olybrius' name appears again after the death of <a href="libius.html"><b>Severus</b></a> in 465, when Gaiseric once

again supported him as a candidate for the western throne.  The sixth-century Byzantine

historian Procopius reported, 

</p>

          <p>"Now, before this time Leo had already appointed and sent Anthemius as

     emperor of the west, a man of the senate of great wealth and high birth, in

     order that he might assist him in the Vandalic war.  And yet Gaiseric kept

     asking and earnestly entreating that the imperial power be given to

     Olybrius, who was married to Placidia, the daughter of Valentinian, and on

     account of his relationship well-disposed toward him, and when he failed in

     this he was still more angry and kept plundering the whole land of the

     emperor"(<i>Bellum Vandalicum</i> 6.9: Dewing trans, p.57).</p>  

 <h3>ACCESSION</h3>



   <p>Olybrius' name came up again in an imperial context in 472, when he was sent by

<a href="leo1.html"><b>Leo</b></a> to attempt to arbitrate in the civil war between the western emperor 

<a href="anthemiu.html"><b>Anthemius</b></a> and

the barbarian general Ricimer.  According to Malalas,</p>



<p>          "While this same Leo was ruling, the Roman emperor Anthemius met his

     end.  He was threatened with the serious enmity of his son-in-law Ricimer,

     who, being a Goth, caused Anthemius to fear for his safety.  Therefore,

     seeking asylum in the church of St. Peter, he took refuge pretending that he

     was ill.  Meanwhile, when the emperor Leo learned what was happening, he

     sent to Rome Olybrius, a Roman patrician, after he and Rusticus had served

     in the consulate [in 464], so that, as a representative of the Roman senate,

     he might quell the hostilities that existed between Anthemius and his son-

     in-law Ricimer.  In addition, Leo enjoined upon him in his directive that,

     after he had reconciled Anthemius and Ricimer, he should depart from

     Rome and go to the king of Africa, the Vandal Gaiseric, with whom Leo

     did not doubt that he had great influence because the sister of Olybrius'

     wife Placidia had married his son, and persuade him to reconcile himself

     with him [Leo].  The emperor Leo, however, suspected that Olybrius

     favored Gaiseric and would secretly take his side.  He therefore feared for

     his own sake, lest Olybrius, who had a tie of marriage with Gaiseric, would

     betray Constantinople to Gaiseric if Gaiseric declared war upon him. 

     Therefore, after Olybrius had departed for Rome, having left his daughter

     and his wife Placidia at Constantinople, the most sacred emperor Leo gave

     a message to a subordinate of the Master of Offices to be delivered to

     Anthemius, emperor of the Romans, in these words: "I have removed," he

     said, "Aspar and Ardaburius from this world, so that no one who might

     oppose me would survive.  But you also must kill your son-in-law Ricimer,

     lest there be anyone who might betray you.  Moreover, I also have sent the

     patrician Olybrius to you; I wish you to kill him, so that you might reign,

     ruling rather than serving others."  Furthermore, Ricimer had placed at

     Portus [Ostia] and the individual ports of Rome a Gothic guard, nor was

     entry permitted to anyone before he had indicated to Ricimer what his

     mission was.  Therefore, when Modestus the *magistrianus*, who had been

     sent by Leo to Anthemius, came to Rome he was immediatedly searched

     and the letters of the emperor, sent from Leo to Anthemius, were taken

     from him and handed over to Ricimer, who showed them to Olybrius. 

     Ricimer immediately summoned Gundobad, the son of his sister, from

     Gaul, where he was Master of Soldiers, who, having killed the emperor

     Anthemius in the very church of St. Peter the Apostle, where he had

     taken refuge, then returned to Gaul.  Then Ricimer established Olybrius as

     emperor at Rome, with the approval of the senate, where, after he had

     reigned for a few months, he encountered death and succumbed to fate"

     (<i>Chron</i>. 373-375).</p>



  <p> From a political perspective, Ricimer had made a good choice.  Olybrius not only would

have been acceptable to the Roman Senate on the grounds of his aristocratic heritage, but

he also would have provided a candidate much more palatable than the Greek 

<a href="anthemiu.html"><b>Anthemius</b></a>.</p>



   <p>Other sources, however, indicate that Ricimer proclaimed Olybrius emperor, in

opposition to <a href="anthemiu.html"><b>Anthemius</b></a>,

 well before the latter's death, probably in April, 472.  For

example, John of Antioch recounts,</p>



          <p>"Anthemius was living in the palace.  Ricimer cut off the districts by the

     Tiber and afflicted those inside with hunger.  Hence, when there was an

     engagement with them, a great part of Anthemius' faction fell.  Ricimer

     overwhelmed the rest by treachery and appointed Olybrius emperor.  Civil

     war had then afflicted Rome for five whole months, until those around

     Anthemius gave in to the barbarians and left their ruler defenseless.  He

     mingled with those begging alms and went among the suppliants of the

     martyr Chrysogonus [now Santa Maria in Trastevere].  There he was

     beheaded by Gundobad, Ricimer's nephew, after reigning five years, three

     months, and eighteen days." (<i>fr</i>.209.1-2: Gordon trans., pp.122-123) </p>



<p>And the <i>Fasti vindobonenses priores</i> likewise reported, "During this consulate a civil

war occurred at Rome between the emperor Anthemius, and the emperor Olybrius was

proclaimed at Rome, and the emperor Anthemius was killed on 11 July: ("<i>his cons.

bellum civile gestum est Romae inter Anthemius imperatorem et Ricimere patricio, et

levatus est imp. Olybrius Romae, et occisus est imp. Anthemius V idus Iulias</i>": no.606.

<i>s.a.</i> 472).  Cassiodorus not only put Olybrius' accession before 

<a href="anthemiu.html"><b>Anthemius'</b></a> death, but also

blamed Ricimer, not Gundobad: "During this consulate, the patrician Ricimer, having

made Olybrius emperor at Rome, after a short battle in the city killed Anthemius contrary

to reverence for the emperor and the claims of marriage..." ("<i>His conss. patricius Ricimer

Romae facto imperatore Olybrio Anthemium contra reverentiam principis et ius

adfinitatis cum brevi clade civitatis extinguit...</i>": 1293, <i>s.a</i>.472).</p>  



   <p>Two eastern sources, however, not only suggest that 

<a href="anthemiu.html"><b>Anthemius</b></a> was killed by Ricimer,

but also limit their discussions of Olybrius' reign to bare notices of his accession and

death.  Count Marcellinus noted, "The emperor Anthemius was killed at Rome by his

son-in-law Ricimer, and Olybrius, having been put into his place, died in the seventh

month of his rule" ("<i>Anthemius imperator Romae a Recimero genero suo occiditur.  loco

eius Olybrius substitutus septimo mense imperii sui vita defunctus est</i>": *Chron*.

s.a.472).  And Procopius reported, "Now Anthemius, the emperor of the west, died at the

hand of his son-in-law Ricimer, and Olybrius, succeeding to the throne, suffered the same

fate a short time afterward" (<i>Bellum Vandalicum </i>7.1: Dewing trans., p.65).  It remains

to be seen, therefore, whether or not Olybrius was named emperor before the death of

<a href="anthemiu.html"><b>Anthemius</b></a>.

</p>

                         

                             <h3>REIGN</h3>



  <p> Scarcely anything of consequence is known to have occurred during Olybrius' brief

reign.  The most significant events to appear in the sources are the death of Ricimer and

the elevation of Gundobad to the position of Patrician and Master of Soldiers.  John of

Antioch noted, "After Olybrius had become ruler over the Romans in this way, Ricimer

departed life within thirty days [9 August], after vomiting much blood" (<i>fr</i>.209.2: Gordon

trans., pp.122-123).  Cassiodorus gave Ricimer a few more days of life: "He did not enjoy

himself long after the perpetration of this crime, and he died after forty days [19 August]"

("<i>qui non diutius peracto scelere gloriatus post XL dies defunctus est</i>": <i>Chron</i>. 1293,

s.a.472).  The <i>Fasti vindobonenses priores</i> (no.607) establish the date of Ricimer's

death more precisely: "And Ricimer died on 18 August" ("<i>et defunctus est Ricimer XV

kl. Septemb.</i>").

</p>

  <p> The same source reports, "In this year Gundobad was appointed Patrician by the

emperor Olybrius" ("<i>eo anno Gundobadus patricius factus ab Olybrio imp</i>." <i>Fast. vind.

prior</i>.608).  And Paul the Deacon likewise notes, "After the death of Ricimer, the

emperor Olybrius appointed as Patrician Ricimer's nephew Gundobad" ("<i>mortuo

Ricimere Olibrius imperator Gundibarum eius nepotem patricium effecit</i>": <i>Historia

Roman</i>a 15.5).</p> 



   <p>The only indication of any policies of Olybrius is found on his coinage (see Kent,

<i>RIC</i>), which was struck only in gold, at Rome and Milan.  Milan struck only tremisses

of the usual cross in wreath type.  But the Roman solidi and tremisses broke with

tradition.  In the past, solidi had had legends such as <i>SALVS REIPUBLICAE</i> ("Salvation

of the Republic") and<i> VICTORIA AVGGG </i>("Victory of the Emperors"), and tremisses

bore on the reverse a simple cross within a wreath without any legend.  The solidi and

tremisses of Olybrius struck at Rome, however, both bore a cross, which on the tremisses

was sometimes jeweled, and the innovative legend <i>SALVS MUNDI</i> ("Salvation of the

World").  This design is so novel that it must have been introduced at the specific

command of Olybrius himself, and it surely is a reflection of his pious preoccupation with

religious matters.</p>



                              <h3>DEATH</h3>



   Olybrius was the shortest lived of all the "shadow" emperors.  John of Antioch reports, 



   <p> "Olybrius survived only thirteen days after [Ricimer's death] and then,

     attacked by dropsy, he died, having been reckoned among the emperors for

     six months.  Gundobad, Ricimer's nephew, succeeded to Ricimer's position

     and raised Glycerius, who had held the office of Count of the Domestics, to

     the throne" (<i>fr</i>. 209.2: Gordon trans., pp.122-123) </p>  



<p>Other writers provide brief notices of Olybrius' death: Cassiodorus reported, "Olybrius

departed from this life in the seventh month of his reign" ("<i>Olybrius autem VII imperii

mense vitam peregit</i>": <i>Chron</i>. 1293); Ennodius noted, "At the very beginning of his

reign he lived his last day" ("<i>in ipsis exordiis diem clausit extremum</i>": <i>Vita Epiphanii</i>

350); the <i>Paschale campanum</i> provided one specific date: "And Olybrius died on 2

November" ("<i>et Olybrius moritur IIII non. Novemb.</i>"); and the <i>Fasti vindobonenses

priores</i> (no.609) provided another, "And the emperor Olybrius died at Rome on 22

October" ("<i>et defunctus est imp. Olybrius Romae X kl. Novemb</i>.").</p>



   <p>These reports allow one to resolve the question of the timing of Olybrius' accession. 

Olybrius died either on 28 October (<i>Fast.vind.prior</i>.) or 2 November (<i>Paschale

campanum</i>), in either the sixth (John of Antioch) or seventh (Cassiodorus, Marcellinus)

month of his rule.  This would put his accession in April, or early May at the very latest. 

But <a href="anthemiu.html"><b>Anthemius</b></a> was killed on 11 July.  Olybrius, therefore, was named emperor by

Ricimer a good two months or more before the death of <a href="anthemiu.html"><b>Anthemius</b></a>.

</p>

                            <h3>EPILOGUE</h3>



   Olybrius provided the last connection in either east or west to the dynasty of

Valentinian and Theodosius.  His reign also marked another failed attempt at a Romano-

barbarian rapprochement: <a href="avitus.html"><b>Avitus</b></a> and 

<a href="major.html"><b>Majorian</b></a> had been ultimately unsuccessful with the

Visigoths, and now Olybrius' ties to the Vandals came to nought.  Personally, Olybrius

seems to have been an example par excellence of a "puppet" emperor, variously serving

the needs of Gaiseric, <a href="leo1.html"><b>Leo</b></a>, and Ricimer.  His personal interests seem to have been

religious, and it is in that realm that his fleeting reign had any impact at all.



   <p>For Procopius, moreover, the emperors of this period were so insignificant that he

confused <a href="nepos.html"><b>Nepos</b></a>

 with Olybrius, stating, after discussing Anthemius,</p> 

<p>

          "And another emperor, Nepos, upon taking over the empire and living to

     enjoy it only a few days, died of disease, and Glycerius after him entered

     into this office and suffered a similar fate.  And after him Augustus

     assumed the imperial power.  There were, moreover, still other emperors in

     the west before this time, but although I know their names well, I shall

     make no mention of them whatsoever.  For it so fell out that they lived only

     a short time after attaining the office, and as a result of this accomplished

     nothing worthy of mention..." (<i>Bellum Vandalicum</i> 7.15-17: Dewing

     trans., p.69)</p>



<p>A fitting epitaph for most of the western emperors of this period.</p>



  <p> A legacy of Olybrius' ties to the Vandals surfaced in 478.  Malchus reported,</p> 



          <p>"Ambassadors came to Byzantium from Carthage, under the leadership of

     Alexander, the guardian of Olybrius' wife [sc. Placidia].  He formerly had

     been sent there by Zeno with the agreement of Placidia herself.  The

     ambassadors said that Huneric had honestly set himself up as a friend of the

     emperor, and so loved all things Roman that he renounced everything that

     he had formerly claimed from the public revenues and also the other

     moneys that Leo had earlier seized from his wife [sc. Eudocia]... He gave

     thanks that the emperor had honored the wife of Olybrius..." (<i>fr</i>. 13: Gordon

  <p> Olybrius' wife and daughter, Placidia and Anicia Juliana, remained in Constantinople

and long outlived him.  Juliana, who held the title "Patricia", presumably a result of her

imperial ties, went on to have an illustrious career of her own.  In 478, <a href="zeno.html"><b>Zeno</b></a> proposed

that she marry Theodoric the Ostrogoth, a move, which if consummated, could have led

to an imperial revival in the west.  She eventually married Fl. Areobindus Dagalaiphus

Areobindus, the great-grandson of the barbarian general Aspar, who served as Master of

Soldiers in his own right ca.503-505 and consul in 506.  Their son, also named Olybrius,

became consul in 491, and a granddaughter was named Proba.  Juliana inherited her

father's devotion to religion, supporting the Chalcedonian party against the emperor

<a href="anastasi.html"><b>Anastasius</b></a> (491-518).  Like her parents, she refurbished the family church of St.

Euphemia.  She also enlarged the church of St. Polyeucta, which had been founded by her

great-grandmother, the empress <a href="eudoc.html"><b>Eudocia</b></a>,

 and in the mid-520s she built a new church in

honor of Mary, "the Mother of God."  Her most well-known surviving legacy is a sixth-

century manuscript of Dioscorides, made to her order, which contains her portrait.  She

died ca.527/528.</p>



   <p>Finally, one could not conclude a discussion of this ephemeral emperor without

mentioning that in 1711 Olybrius served as the protagonist of the opera "Flavio Anicio

Olibrio" by Niccol  Antonia Porpora (1686-1766).
