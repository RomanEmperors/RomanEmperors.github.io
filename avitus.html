<h3>SOURCES</h3>



<p>No connected account of the reign of Avitus survives.  One might have expected some

detail from his son-in-law, Sidonius Apollinaris, but Sidonius' panegyric only takes

Avitus' history up to his acclamation, and Sidonius otherwise says virtually nothing about

Avitus' activities as emperor.  Given the circumstances of Avitus' fall, and Sidonius' need

to make his peace with those who had been responsible for it, this silence is perhaps no

surprise.  Other sources, such as the Spanish chronicler Hydatius and the Byzantine

chronicler John of Antioch, provide some precious insights into Avitus' reign, and these

must be fleshed out wherever possible by bits and snippets found in other sources.</p>



<h3>FAMILY BACKGROUND AND EARLY CAREER</h3>



<p>   Eparchius Avitus, who was born of a senatorial family circa 395, was a native of the

Auvergne in Gaul.  His father may have been the Agricola who was consul in 421. 

Avitus was well educated, being eloquent and perhaps having had some legal training. 

He had at least three children, Agricola; Ecdicius, who later became Patrician and Master

of Soldiers under Julius Nepos in 475; and Papianilla, who married Sidonius, himself a

blue-blooded aristocrat of Lyons, the son and grandson of praetorian prefects of Gaul.</p>





<p>  Avitus had a distinguished civil and military career.  Around his early twenties,

ca.415/420, he undertook a civic mission to the Master of Soldiers, and later emperor,

Constantius, and early in his life he formed close contacts with the Visigothic court at

Toulouse.  He then served under Flavius AÃ«tius in several military posts, and by 437 may

have risen to the office of Master of Soldiers in Gaul.  Subsequently, he rose to become

Praetorian Prefect of Gaul, perhaps ca. 439-440, in which capacity he was able to 

renegotiate the treaty with the Visigoths.  He therefore provides an unusual example of a

person obtaining both civil and military offices of very high rank.  Avitus then seems to

have indulged in the life of leisure to which every senator purported to aspire.  Then, in

451, as a civilian, Avitus was influential in gaining the aid of the Visigoths against Attila

and the Huns, who were subsequently defeated at the Battle of the Mauriac Plain.  But he

then returned to his estate, called Avitacum, at Clermont.</p>





<p> In 455, Avitus was appointed <em>magister militum praesentalis</em> ("Master of Soldiers in the

Presence") by the short-lived emperor

 <a href="petmax.html"><b>Petronius Maximus</b></a> 

and was sent as an ambassador

to the Visigoths, presumably to reconfirm them in their federate status.  Assisted by a

certain Messianus, he was successful.  Sidonius recalled,</p>





<p>	"The chiefs of the Visigoths were letting loose the war they had planned,

when suddenly their fury was checked by tidings that Avitus, armed with an

imperial writ, was already entering the home of the Goths, and, having laid

aside for a little the pomp of the Master's office, had taken upon himself the

authority of an ambassador.... The king and the Master took the stand

together, the master with confident look, while the other ... sued for

clemency... " (<em>Carm</em>.7.399-434: trans. Anderson, 1.153-155).</p>

<h3>ACCESSION</h3>





<p> After the news arrived of Maximus' death on 22 May and of the ensuing Vandal sack of

Rome, Theoderic urged Avitus to assume the purple himself, asserting,</p>





<p>"We do not force this on you, but we say to you: With you as leader, I am a

friend of Rome; with you as Emperor, I am her soldier.  You are not

stealing the sovereignty from anyone; no emperor holds the Latian hills, a

palace without a master is yours... I would that your imperial diadem might

bring me the means to do your service.  My part is but to urge you, but if

Gaul should compel you, as she has the right to do, the world would cherish

your rule..."(Sid.Apoll. <em>Carm</em>. 7.510-518: Anderson trans., 1.163).</p>





<p>One might suspect, of course, that Theoderic's goals were not merely altruistic, and that

he might have seen some benefits for himself and his people if Avitus were to become

emperor.</p>







<p> Theoderic then seems to have accompanied Avitus to Arles, for Marius of Avenches

reported, "Avitus was raised emperor in Gaul, and Theodoric, king of the Goths, entered

Arles in peace with his brothers" ("<em>levatus est Avitus imperator in gallias.  Et ingressus

est Theodoricus rex Gothorum Arelatum cum fratribus suis in pace</em>": nos.1-2).  This

ceremonial arrival of the Gothic royalty would have been a far cry from past occasions

when the Goths had attempted to seize Arles by force of arms. </p>





<p>The requisite Gallic support was soon forthcoming.  At a meeting of the "Council of the

Seven Provinces" at Beaucaire, just outside Arles, the decision is made to name Avitus

emperor, and three days later, on 9 or 10 July, the ceremony was carried out.  Sidonius

continued,</p>





<p>	"Then a great clamor filled the hall of Beaucaire...  Place, hour, and day are

declared auspicious for the assumption of empire...  The lords of the land

assemble in haste and with the soldiers all around set him on a mound. 

There they crown their sorrowing chief with a torque and present him with

the insignia of sovereignty... "(<em>Carm</em>.7.571-579: Anderson trans., 1.167).</p>





<p>Other sources are more concise.  Hydatius tersely reported, "In this year, Avitus, a

citizen of Gaul, was named emperor by the Gallic army and by the notables, first at

Toulouse, then at Arles" ("<em>ipso anno, in Galliis Avitus, Gallus civis, ab exercitu

Gallicano et ab honoratis, primum Tolosae, dehinc apud Arelatum Augustus appelatus

est</em>": <em>Chron</em>.163).  The <em>Auctuarium Prosperi hauniensis</em> stated, "After the murder of

Maximus came Avitus, and, situated in Gaul at Arles, he assumed imperial authority on 9

July" ("<em>post Maximi caedem Avitus ac situs in Galliis apud Arelas imperium sumpsit VII

id. Iulias</em>": no.5); the <em>Fasti vindobonenses priores</em> give a slightly different date, "and

Avitus was acclaimed emperor in Gaul on 10 July" ("<em>et levatus est imp. in Gallis Avitus

VI idus Iulias</em>": no.575).  Cassiodorus noted simply, "After Maximus Avitus assumed

imperial authority in Gaul" ("<em>Post Maximus Avitus in Gallia sumit imperium</em>": no.1264).</p>





<p>It also would seem that Avitus was recognized by the Senate in Rome well before his

actual arrival there.  Victor of Tonnena, for example, recorded, "On the seventy-fifth day

after the [Vandal] capture [of Rome], Avitus, a man of complete simplicity, assumed the

imperial power in Gaul" ("<em>huius quoque captivitatis LXXV die Avitus vir totius

simplicitatis in Galliis imperium sumit</em>": s.a.455).  Victor's date, which works out to 5

August, does not correlate with any of the other dates for Avitus' acclamation; perhaps it

is the date his rule was acknowledged by the Senate in Rome; it is far too late, however,

to be the date that news of his accession arrived in Rome.  And Hydatius noted, "He was

summoned and accepted as emperor by the Romans" ("<em>a Romanis et evocatus et

susceptus fuerat imperator</em>": <em>Chron</em>.166; cf. 163, "<em>Romam pergit et suscipitur</em>"), which

likewise could indicate that Avitus was recognized in Rome before his actual arrival in

Italy.  Such a conclusion also could be inferred from the Italian failure to name a different

successor.</p>





<p>Avitus spent over three months in Gaul consolidating his resources in preparation for

establishing his court in Rome.  His authority was based largely on the support of the

Goths; Sidonius recalled, "You knew that it was not possible to hide from the Gauls that

with you as emperor, the Goths would be at their service" (<em>Carm</em>. 7.520-521).  He seems

to have raised other contingents of barbarian troops as well, all in preparation for his

advance into Italy.</p>





<p>The <em>Auctuarium Prosperi</em> then continues, "And he entered Italy with his comrades in

this appropriated honor on 21 September" ("<em>Italiamque cum praesumpti honoris collegiis

ingressus XI k. Oct.</em>": no.7).  An anti-Avitus bias can already be seen in the choice of

words of this Italian source.  It probably was on this journey that Avitus undertook some

kind of initiative in the Danubian area.  Sidonius recalled, "And his march alone

recovered the Pannonias, lost for so many generations" (<em>Carm</em>. 7.589-690).  Now, at this

time the Danubian provinces were still in an uproar following the disintegration of the

Hun Empire after the Battle of the Nedao River in 454.  Avitus could have accomplished

little of consequence here, especially as most of this territory was under the jurisdiction

of the eastern emperor anyway.  But it may be that Avitus took the opportunity during his

journey at least to restore imperial authority in upper Danubian provinces such as

Noricum, an area where Avitus had campaigned in his youth (Sid.Apoll. <em>Carm</em>. 7.233). 

Before his arrival at Rome, Avitus also seems to have stationed Remistus, a Visigoth

whom he had made Patrician and Master of Soldiers, at Ravenna with a force of Goths. 

After the murder of AÃ«tius in 454, this office seems to have left vacant by both

<a href="valenIII.html"><b>Valentinian III</b></a> and 

<a href="petmax.html"><b>Petronius Maximus</b></a> out

 of a fear that a successor would inherit AÃ«tius'

influence over the state.  In this, it would turn out, they were only too

 correct.</p>





<h3>REIGN</h3>

<p>If Avitus were going to be able to consolidate his authority, he would have to conciliate

several possible sources of opposition, including: 1) the Vandals, fresh from their sack of

Rome; 2) Marcian (450-457), the legitimate emperor in Constantinople; 3) 

<a href="major.html"><b>Majorian</b></a> and

Ricimer, the commanders of the Italian army; and 4) the Italian senators, who would have

looked askance at any "foreign" emperor, and who were accustomed to controlling the

high offices of state in their own interest.</p>





<p>One of Avitus' first actions was to seek recognition from Marcian.  Hydatius, for

example, reported, "Avitus sent ambassadors to Marcian regarding a sharing of the rule"

("<em>Per Avitum ... legati ad Marcianum pro unanimitate mittuntur imperii</em>": <em>Chron</em>.166).  It

is unclear whether or not Marcian ever did accept Avitus.  Hyatius does in fact claim,

"Marcian and Avitus make use of the principate of the Roman Empire in concord"

("<em>Marcianus et Avitus concordes principatu Romani utuntur imperii</em>": <em>Chron</em>. 169).  But

other considerations suggest that this "concord" might have fallen short of actual

recognition.  The clearest evidence against recognition is that in 456 the east and west

each had their own consuls, Fl. Varanes and Fl. Iohannes in the east, and Avitus himself

in the west, and neither recognized the other's. </p>





<p>As for the Vandals, Marcian had already taken it upon himself to try to deal with them. 

The contemporary Byzantine historian Priscus recounted,</p>





<p>"After Gaiseric sacked Rome and while Avitus was ruling, Marcian, the

emperor of the eastern Romans, sent ambassadors to Gaiseric, the ruler of

the Vandals, requesting that he keep away from the land of Italy... And,

having accomplished nothing, the ambassadors returned to the east, for

Gaiseric heeded none of the commands from Marcian..." (<em>fr</em>.24).</p>





<p>Avitus, too, attempted to deal with the Vandals by diplomatic means.  Also according to

Priscus, he dispatched an embassy to Gaiseric demanding that he abide by the treaty

made in 442:</p>





<p>"And Avitus, the emperor of the western Romans, also sent an embassy

himself to Gaiseric, reminding him of the old treaty, and saying that if he

did not choose to abide by it, he too would make preparations, trusting to

the domestic forces and the support of his allies" (<em>fr</em>.24).</p>





<p>The "domestic forces" presumably consisted of the 

Italian army of <a href="major.html"><b>Majorian</b></a>

 and Ricimer,

whereas the "allies" would have been assorted barbarian federates that Avitus brought

from Gaul.  By this time, moreover, any Vandal raiding would have been terminated by

the end of the sailing season in November.</p>





<p>Avitus also was engaged in activities in Spain.  Hydatius notes, under the year 455,

"Count Fronto was sent by the emperor Avitus as ambassador to the Suevi."  But the

primary imperial initiatives in Spain were in the hands of Avitus' ally, the Visigothic king

Theoderic II.  Hydatius continued,</p>





<p>"Likewise, ambassadors also were sent to the same people by Theoderic,

king of the Goths, because he was loyal to the Roman Empire, in order that

they might preserve the things promised in their sworn treaty with him just

as with the Roman Empire, because they were joined in a single treaty of

peace... ("<em>similiter et a rege Gothorum Theodorico, quia fidus Romano

esset imperio, legati ad eosdem mittuntur, ut tam secum quam cum Romano

imperio, quia uno essent pacis foedere copulati, iurati foederis promissa

servarent...</em>": <em>Chron</em>. 170).</p>





<p>In this instance, Theoderic played upon his professed loyalty to Avitus and the imperial

government and claimed to be acting in the name of the Roman state.  When the Suevi

replied by invading the Roman province of Tarraconensis, the Visigoths fulfilled their

role as loyal federates: "Theodoric, king of the Goths, entered Spain with a huge army of

his own, at the desire and command of emperor Avitus" ("<em>Hispanias rex Gothorum

Theodoricus, cum ingenti exercitu suo et cum voluntate et ordinatione Aviti imperatoris</em>":

Hydatius, <em>Chron</em>. 173).  In 456, the Suevi were devastatingly defeated at the Battle of the

Urbicus River, and -- claims to be acting in the name of the Roman government aside --

the Visigothic conquest of Spain had begun.</p>





<p>Meanwhile, for Avitus in Rome the year 456 had begun auspiciously.  On 1 January,

Avitus entered the consulate like any emperor beginning his first full year of rule. 

Sidonius, only about twenty-three years old, delivered the panegyric (<em>Carm</em>.7) and as a

consequence had a statue erected in own his honor in the Forum of Trajan.  Sidonius'

poem, however, or at least its published version, only covered Avitus' career up to his

accession.  Addressing Rome, it concluded:</p>



<p>"He will restore Libya to you a fourth time in chains... it is easy to feel sure

even now of what he can do by waging war, how he shall, time and again,

bring nations under your yoke... that man who, as a subject shrank from the

glorious omens of sovereignty...  But now be of good cheer with such a

man for emperor... Lo, this prince of riper years shall bring back youth to

you whom child-princes have made old" (<em>Carm</em>.7.587-598: trans.

Anderson, p.169)...</p>





<p>Even if Sidonius' rosy sentiments lifted Roman morale, they did nothing to deal with the

very real problems that Avitus faced.</p>





<p>Meanwhile, early in the year, it seems, Marcian sent another embassy to Africa:</p>





<p>"And Marcian sent to Gaiseric further letters and the ambassador Bleda,

who was a bishop of the heresy of Gaiseric... When he arrived in his

presence and realized that Gaiseric was not going to give heed to his

embassy, he broke forth into headstrong words, saying that it would not

profit him if, carried away by his present prosperity, he should be prepared

to rouse the emperor of the eastern Romans to war against him... But

neither the reasonableness of the words spoken before in the embassy nor

the fear of threats induced Gaiseric to think moderately, for he dismissed

Bleda without success, and dispatching a force again to Sicily and to the

neighboring part of Italy, he ravaged it all "(<em>fr</em>.24).</p>





<p>These renewed raids probably occurred in March, with the reopening of the sailing

season.  They provided Avitus with a means for keeping at least one of his Italian

generals busy.  Hydatius reported,</p>





<p>"At this time it was announced to king Theoderic [of the Visigoths] that

through Avitus a great multitude of Vandals, which had set out from

Carthage for Gaul and Italy with sixty ships, was destroyed after being

trapped by Count Ricimer...  In Corsica there was a slaughter of a multitude

of Vandals" (<em>Chron</em>. 176-177).</p>



<p>Eventually, however, Avitus' Italian welcome wore thin.  John of Antioch tells of his

growing difficulties:</p>





<p>"When Avitus was emperor of Rome there was famine at the same time. 

The mob put the blame on Avitus and compelled him to dismiss from the

city of the Romans his allies who had entered with him from Gaul.  He also

sent away the Goths whom he had brought for his own guard, after

distributing money to them derived from public works whose bronze

fittings he sold to merchants, for there was no gold in the royal treasuries. 

This removal of adornments from their city roused the Romans to revolt"

(<em>fr</em>.202: Gordon trans., p.116).</p>





<p>This report not only indicates, again, that the aforementioned "allies" were barbarian

forces that Avitus had brought from Gaul, but also makes clear that Avitus' barbarian

soldiery included others than just Visigoths.</p>





<h3>DEPOSITION</h3>

<p>Eventually, this local unrest escalated into a military revolt, led by <a href="major.html"><b>Majorian</b></a>

 and

Ricimer.  It may be that the Italian high command, heartened by its recent victory over the

Vandals and having thrown off the malaise of 455, was ready to reassert its own

authority.  Early in the fall of 456 Avitus was forced to depart Rome and attempt to return

to Gaul.  According to John of Antioch (<i>fr</i>.202):</p>





<p>	"Majorian and Ricimer openly rebelled against Avitus, for they no longer

feared the Goths, and Avitus, fearing internal disturbances and the

hostilities of the Vandals, left Rome on the road to Gaul.  Attacking him on

the road, Majorian and Ricimer compelled [Avitus] to flee to a holy

precinct, renounce his office, and remove his royal raiment.  Majorian and

his company did not withdraw until Avitus died of starvation.  He had held

the imperial office for eight months.  Some say he was strangled.  This was

the end of Avitus' life and reign" (<em>fr</em>.202: Gordon trans., p.116).</p>

<p>John's account, however, has some problems.  The length he gives for Avitus' reign is far

too short, and he also expresses some uncertainty about the manner of Avitus' death,

providing two different versions.  He also leaves out some crucial information.  Other

sources help to clear up some of these inconsistencies.</p>





<p>For one thing, it would appear that an initial encounter between the rebels and Avitus'

forces took place at Ravenna.  The <em>Fasti vindobonenses priores</em> note, "The Patrician

Remistus was killed at the Palace in Classis [at Ravenna] on 17 September" ("<em>occisus est

Remistus patricius in Palatio Classis XV kl. Octob.</em>": no.579; cf. <em>Auctuar. Prosp. haun</em>.

no.1, "Remistus patricius in Classe peremptus interiit XV k. Oct.").  Remistus, who

clearly had been a partisan of Avitus, then was replaced as Patrician and Master of

Soldiers by Messianus, who had assisted Avitus in the conciliation of the Visigoths the

previous year.</p>





<p> Avitus, meanwhile, had attempted to return to Gaul, doubtless with the intention of

reassembling the troops that he had dismissed earlier.  Hydatius recalled that in 456 the

tribune Hesychius arrived in Gallicia in Spain, and announced that "as was noted above, a

multitude of Vandals had been slain in Corsica, and that Avitus had gone from Rome to

Arles in Gaul" ("<em>id quod supra, in Corsica, caesam multitudinem Vandalorum, et Avitum

de Italia ad Gallias Arelate successisse</em>": <em>Chron</em>.177).  If taken literally, this would mean

that Avitus actually returned to Gaul after his retreat from Rome.  This is, of course,

possible, but it may be that Hesychius left for Spain only knowing that Avitus had

departed Rome intending to return to Gaul, without actually knowing whether or not he

had actually arrived there.</p>

<p>What is clear is that a month after the skirmish at Ravenna -- a period that would in fact

have been long enough for Avitus to travel to Arles and then return to Italy with whatever

forces he could muster -- a decisive battle was fought between Avitus and his adversaries

at Piacenza.  The <em>Auctuarium Prosperi</em> reports,</p>



<p>"The emperor Avitus entered Piacenza with the force of his allies, which

the Master of Soldiers Ricimer encountered with the great strength of his

own army.  After battle had been joined, Avitus fled after a great slaughter

of his own men.  His life was spared and the bishop Eusebius [om Milan]

changed him from an emperor into a bishop.  Messianus, the Patrician of

Avitus, was killed in this battle on 18 October ("<em>Imperator Avitus

Placentiam cum sociorum robore ingressus, quem cum magna vi exercitus

magister militum Recimer excepit. commisso proelio Avitus cum magna

suorum caede terga vertit, quem vitae reservatum Eusebius episcopus ex

imperatore episcopum facit. interfectus in eo proelio Missianus patricius

Aviti XV k. Novemb.</em>" (<em>s.a</em>.456).</p>





<p>The reference to the presence of Avitus' "allies", whom he clearly had earlier dismissed,

again suggests that if Avitus did not, as Hydatius reported, actually return to Gaul, he at

least was able to receive reinforcements prior to the final encounter.</p>





<p>As for other sources, the <em>Fasti vindobonenses priores</em> provide a slightly different date:

"And on 17 October the emperor was taken captive at Piacenza by the Master of Soldiers

Ricimer and his patrician Messianus was killed" ("<em>et captivus est imp. Placentia a magis.

mil. Ricimere et occisus est Messiam patricius eius XVI kl. Nov.</em>": no.580); Cassiodorus

simply noted, "Avitus relinquished his power at Piacenza" ("<em>Placentiae deposuit Avitus

imperium</em>": <em>Chron</em>. 1266).  And Victor of Tonnena clarified that Avitus was actually

made bishop of, and not merely at, Piacenza: "The Patrician Ricimer overcame Avitus;

sparing his innocence, he made him bishop of the city of Piacenza" ("<em>Ricimirus patricius

Avitum superat, cuius innocentiae parcens Placentiae civitatis episcopum facit</em>": <em>s.a</em>.455).</p>





<p>Avitus, therefore, was stripped of his imperial dignity and forcibly consecrated bishop

of Piacenza, the first time that this novel method was used to dispose of a deposed

emperor.  He had ruled for just over one year and three months (<em>Chron.Gall. 511</em> no.625,

"<em>Avitus cum eo anno uno et m. III</em>"; <em>Continuatio ad Prosperum</em>, "Inpartius Avitus ann. I

 mens.III").  </p>



<h3>AFTERMATH AND DEATH</h3>





<p>Thus ended Avitus' reign, but not his life.  As for what happened to Avitus later,

Gregory of Tours records, </p>





<p>"Avitus, one of the senators and, as is clearly manifest, a citizen of the

Auvergne, after he had become Roman emperor was expelled by the

senators and ordained bishop of the city of Piacenza when he desired to act

excessively.  When he learned, however, that the Senate, still indignant,

wished to take his life, he set out for the basilica of St. Julian, the Arvernian

martyr, with many offerings.  But the course of his life was completed

during the journey, and, having been brought to the village of Brioude, he

was buried at the feet of the aforementioned martyr.  Majorian succeeded

him, and in Gaul Aegidius, a Roman, was made Master of Soldiers "("<em>Avitus

enim unus ex senatoribus et, valde manifestum est, cives Arvernus, cum

Romanum ambisset imperium, luxoriose agere volens, a senatoribus

proiectus, apud Placentiam urbem episcopus ordinatur.  conperto autem,

quod adhuc indignans senatus vita eum privare vellit, basilica sancti

Iuliani Arverni martyris cum multis muneribus expetivit.  sed impleto in

itinere vitae cursu, obiit, delatusque ad Brivatensem vicum, ad pedes

antedicti martyris est sepultus, cui Maiorianus successit.  In Galliis autem

Aegidius ex Romanis magister militum datus est</em>": <em>Historia Francorum</em>

2.11).</p>





<p>Other sources, too, indicate that Avitus lived at least into 457.  The <em>Gallic Chronicle of

511</em>, for example, notes under the year 457, "Marcian died, and Avitus was killed by

Majorian, Count of the Domestics, at Placentia" ("<em>Marcianus obiit, et Avitus occisus est a

Maioriano comite domesticorum Placentiae</em>": no.627-628).  And Hydatius, who could

serve as a virtual biographer of Avitus, is particularly emphatic, stating, under the year

457, which he also identified as Avitus' third regnal year, "Avitus, in the third year after

he had been made emperor by the Gauls and by the Goths, loses the empire, destitute of

the aid promised by the Goths, and also loses his life" ("<em>Avitus, tertio anno posteaquam a

Gallis et a Gothis factus fuerat imperator, caret imperio Gothorum promisso destitutus

auxilio, caret et vita</em>": <em>Chron</em>. 183).</p>





<p>Meanwhile, back in Gaul, there occurred sometime between the deposition of Avitus in

October 456 and the end of 457 another Gallic attempt to seize the throne. Sidonius

makes a cryptic reference to a "Marcellan conspiracy for seizing the diadem" ("<em>de

capessendo diademate coniuratio Marcellana</em>": <em>Epist</em>. 1.11.6; the manuscript reading

"Marcellana" is correct, not "Marcelliniana" or "Marcellini", to which it generally has

been emended).  The conspiracy somehow involved a person named Marcellus, of whom

there are several attested in Gaul at this time, and it just may have involved an effort to

put Avitus back on the throne -- the only other possibility, it would seem, being that an

attempt was made to make some other, unknown, person emperor.</p>





<p>  Avitus, therefore, not only lived on into 457, but, in some quarters, continued to be

recognized as emperor.  He also attempted to return to Gaul, although whether he actually

made it there is unclear, for he soon died.  And here one notes the differing roles assigned

in the sources to Ricimer and <a href="major.html"><b>Majorian</b></a>

 in Avitus' downfall.  Ricimer alone is given credit

for Avitus' defeat at the the Battle of Piacenza (<em>Auctuarium Prosperi</em>, <em>Fasti

vindobonenses</em>).  <a href="major.html"><b>Majorian</b></a>, on the other hand, is the only individual who is blamed for

Avitus' death, at some later time: the <em>Gallic Chronicle of 511</em> places the event at Placentia

after the death of Marcian in late January, 457; and John of Antioch claims that <a href="major.html"><b>Majorian</b></a>

either starved or strangled Avitus after the latter's deposition.  In light of Gregory's claim

that Avitus died on the road home, one might speculate that just before or after reaching

Gaul he may have been chased down by <a href="major.html"><b>Majorian</b></a>,

 who would have been intent on

thwarting any Avitan revival.  And Avitus' resultant death, coupled with <a href="major.html"><b>Majorian</b></a> nearby,

may be what brought to an end the "Marcellan conspiracy."</p>





<h3>EPILOGUE</h3>





<p> Avitus' brief reign was the last significant attempt in the western empire to reverse the

trend toward the Italianization of the empire.  As a Gaul, he was never popular with Italy,

and he was soon faced with opposition not only from the urban mob of Rome,

but also, and presumably more seriously, from the Italian senators as well.  Behind

Gregory of Tours' claim that he was opposed by the senators for acting "excessively"

("<em>luxoriose</em>": Victorian commentators gave this word libidinous connotations, but that is

not its primary meaning).  Of course, for Italian senators Avitus' mere accession would

have been excessive enough.  But what is known of his pattern of appointments to

imperial office would also have confirmed them in this impression.</p>





<p>For Avitus is known only to have appointed Gauls to office.  Various hints provided by

Sidonius and others suggest that, under Avitus, officials of the central administration may

have included the Gauls Magnus of Narbonne as Master of Offices, Rusticius Helpidius

Domnolus as Quaestor of the Sacred Palace, and Consentius of Narbonne as Caretaker of

the Palace (<em>cura palatii</em>) and ambassador to Constantinople.  The prestigious title of

Patrician and Master of Soldiers, moreover, was given to two Gauls, Messianus and the

Goth Remistus.  Remistus also would have been the first barbarian named to this

position.  Avitus seems to have been particularly zealous about appointing Gauls to

various entry-level and lower-level imperial positions.  Individuals such as Catullinus,

Eutropius, Hesychius, Avitus of Cottion, Petrus, and Sidonius himself were given the

junior position of "Tribune and Notary"; and Agrippinus and Fronto were made military

counts.  In default of greater information, such a pattern can only be suggestive, but given

the equal lack of evidence for any Italian appointments, one might suppose that Avitus'

preference for Gauls in office was one of the reasons for opposition against him by the

Italian senators.</p>





<p>Avitus' rule also provided the best opportunity for creating a coalition between Romans

and barbarians.  But in this case, his alliance with the Visigoths fell victim to Theoderic's

own successes in Spain, and the resultant Visigothic failure to send assistance when he

needed it the most.  Avitus' failure indicates the degree to which the trend toward the

disintegration of the western empire had become irreversible.  Thomas Hodgkin

pronounced an eloquent epitaph on Avitus' reign: "He was the keystone of a great and

important political combination, a combination which, had it endured, would certainly

have changed the face of Europe, and might have anticipated the Empire of Charles the

Great in favour of a nobler nation than the Franks, and without the interposition of three

centuries of barbarism" (p.395).</p>
