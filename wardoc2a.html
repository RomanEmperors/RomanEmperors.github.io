</p><p><b>The Nature of the Evidence</b></p></center>

<p>We are immediately confronted by a paradox. The literary sources mostly
pertain to the Republican period, i.e. to the death of Caesar, but this
article is mostly concerned with the Empire, i.e. from 30 B.C. onward.
For the Republic we have Livy's and Polybius' histories of the Second Punic
War (218-201); Appian's <i>Libyca</i> for the Third (149-146); Sallust's
<i>Jugurthine
War</i> for the late 2<sup>nd</sup> century B.C.; the anonymous author
of the <i>African War</i> included in the corpus of Caesar's writings for
the struggle in 48-46; scattered passages in Plutarch's lives of Marius,
Sulla, Pompey, Caesar and Cato Minor; sections of Appian's <i>Civil War</i>
down to 36 B.C. and in Dio Cassius (often in the medieval Byzantine excerpts);
bits in the geographies of Strabo and Mela and book 5 of Pliny the Elder's
<i>Natural
History</i>. No writer provides comparable narrative information for the
Empire: in the <i>Annals</i> and <i>Histories</i> Tacitus referred to Africa
only so far as he deemed it relevant to his major concerns of imperial
politics, and the same is true of Cassius Dio and later writers such as
Eutropius and Orosius. Only Tacitus narrates the revolt of Tacfarinas in
A.D. 17-24, though nobody now is quite sure why he chose to give it such
prominence (see Part 3, below), but he does not inform his readers of decisions
to locate the headquarters of the Third Legion at Ammaedara (Haidra) and
then to shift it to Theveste (Tébessa).<b><a href="#N_1_">[[1]]</a></b>
</p><p>But this paradox need not cause despair, for archaeology and epigraphy
provide a partial rescue. Some sites have been abandoned since Roman times,
allowing archaeologists to work unhampered by modern inhabitation. As a
consequence, Africa provides the richest harvest of inscriptions in the
Roman Empire, perhaps 250,000 in all: dedications of construction projects,
milestones and tombstones.<b><a href="#N_2_">[[2]]</a></b> The spread is
uneven, as military sites (particularly Lambaesis) provide more inscriptions
than civilian locations, there is a sharp numerical swell in the early
3<sup>rd</sup> century followed by a steep drop, and the texts are disproportionally
funerary.
</p><center>
<p><b>Geography</b></p></center>

<p>The accompanying maps are adequate but not detailed. The best atlas
is R. J. A. Talbert, ed. <i>The Barrington Atlas of the Classical World</i>,
but it is most likely to be found only in major libraries. The Michelin,
Hallwag, and Baedeker road maps are excellent and denote most of the major
Roman sites with special archaeological symbols. A list of Roman sites
and their modern equivalents is given below, preceding the Bibliography.
</p><p>Broadly speaking, we are here concerned with the Maghreb, an area that
stretches from the Atlantic coast on the west to the east coast of Tunisia
some 1400 miles to the east, another 500+ to Benghazi, and from 50 to 300
miles from the Mediterranean coast southward to the edge of the Sahara.
The Atlas mountains and their offshoots, particularly the Aurès,
run roughly southwest-northeast. Rome sought to control what she regarded
as the agriculturally-valuable lands. In the High Plains and Steppes, where
one could reasonably expect at least 4 inches of rain per year, growers
mastered the techniques of dry farming and produced enormous yields of
olives; in the Tell, where rainfall averages 16 inches, farmers grew great
quantities of wheat. Many maps show the so-called 100-mm. and 400 mm. isohyets.
</p><p>This is a vast region, and it is impossible to overemphasize that Rome
held it with a strikingly small garrison: a single legion of 5,500 men
if at full strength and probably not over 25,000 auxiliary troops.<b><a href="#N_3_">[[3]]</a></b>&nbsp;
It is also vital to stress that there was never a sharp frontier in the
south. Roman control slowly diminished. Once the conquest was complete,
the Roman army's mission was to keep the region quiet and regulate the
movement of the semi-nomadic, transhumant natives from their lands beyond
the Roman frontier zone. It was never a matter of keeping these people
with their flocks out of Roman farmland, but rather of controlling the
timing and routes they took.<b><a href="#N_4_">[[4]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b>About this Article:</b></p></center>

<p>Readers should be clear as to the topical, geographical and chronological
boundaries of this study: the military occupation of what is now Tunisia
and eastern Algeria through the reign of Hadrian which ended in A.D. 138.
This is not a narrative history of the entire period and social and economic
matters appear only incidentally. Rome never showed as much concern for
the security of either Tripolitania (western Libya) or Mauretania (western
Algeria and Morocco) as she did for Africa Proconsularis. Although Rome's
primary military force in this immense region, <i>Legio III Augusta,</i>
moved its headquarters on several occasions, these base camps were always
in Proconsularis. Detachments (<i>vexillationes</i>) of the Third and even
another legion (as <i>IX Hispana</i> in the 20s A.D.) sometimes operated
outside this core area, but the <i>hiberna</i> of <i>III Augusta</i> were
invariably in the uplands southwest of Carthage.<b><a href="#N_5_">[[5]]</a></b>
Scattered auxiliary units rather than the legion were the permanent garrison
of Tripolitania and Mauretania, and this reliance on second-grade troops
symbolizes the value Rome placed on these lands. That is to say, we will
have relatively little to say of the army and its activities outside the
heartland of Roman North Africa.<b><a href="#N_6_">[[6]]</a></b> Further,
Egypt and Cyrenaica (eastern Libya) are entirely excluded from the present
study.
</p><p>Any chronological terminus is to some extent arbitrary and inaccurate,
as history does not have sharp breaks. In defense of A.D. 138, one can
stress that by that time the imperial government had moved <i>III Augusta</i>
to Lambaesis, where it remained thereafter, had encircled the Aurès
Mountains and built the major military roads, and had established a series
of frontier works to regulate the movement of the semi-nomadic peoples
to the south and west of the lands Rome controlled.<b><a href="#N_7_">[[7]]</a></b>
<br>Further, the Severan period in the early 3<sup>rd</sup> century saw
considerable shuffling of troops, a strengthening of the garrison in Tripolitania,
and an overall emphasis on the military that points toward the Late Empire.
In brief, the centuries after about 200 can conveniently be set aside for
separate treatment elsewhere.

</p><p><b>Rome, Carthage, and the Numidian Kingdom to 146 B.C.</b></p></center>

<p>The extension of Roman power to North Africa arose directly, but gradually
and reluctantly, from the titanic conflicts with Carthage which began in
264 B.C. A narrative of the Punic Wars is out of place here, and reliable
accounts are readily available elsewhere.<b><a href="#N_8_">[[8]]</a></b>
A few points are necessary as background for the imperial period. First,
the costs to Rome in manpower and money were enormous.<b><a href="#N_9_">[[9]]</a></b>
Second, at the conclusion of the wars, Rome was the dominant power in the
entire Mediterranean basin and had no rivals at all in the western half
of it. Third, Rome was well on the road to becoming a true empire, as she
acquired her first possessions outside Italy, the <i>provinciae</i> of
Sicily, Sardinia-Corsica, Nearer and Farther (or Citerior and Ulterior)
Spain, and Africa and was involved in Numidia as well.
</p><p>While acquisition of glory and fame was a long-established feature of
Roman culture, particularly among the aristocracy where it was closely
tied to the advancement of political careers,<b><a href="#N_10_">[[10]]</a></b>
the government was a reluctant imperialist when lands outside Italy were
at issue. Especially in the early centuries of empire, when Rome assumed
direct rule over foreign territories at the conclusion of a war the reason
was not so much that she wanted them for herself as that she did not want
the defeated enemy to continue in possession or try to regain them and
thereby recover. Alternatively, Rome feared that some other power might
attempt to meddle in what had become her sphere of interest. Instead of
annexation, Rome sometimes rewarded allies with grants of land taken from
their shared and now crushed foe. And of course combinations of these policies
were frequently employed. Treatment of defeated Carthage illustrates Roman
policies well and leads us into Africa in the imperial period.
</p><p>Following victory in the First Punic War (264-241), Rome imposed stiff
monetary penalties (not the issue here) and deprived Carthage of her possessions
close to Italy, keeping about three-quarters of Sicily for herself and
presenting most of the rest of it to her faithful ally king Hiero of Syracuse.
About the same time she seized Sardinia and Corsica and thereafter governed
them as a single province. Note, however, that Rome did not confiscate
any of the Carthaginian homeland or demand the surrender of her commanders.
At the end of the Second War in 201, Roman conduct was similar. As before,
Rome imposed heavy financial indemnities, expelled Carthage from its overseas
possessions (which became Rome's two Spanish provinces), declined to confiscate
any of the Carthaginian homeland for herself, left Hannibal free, and rewarded
her allies, notably king Masinissa of Numidia. One new feature must be
noted. The peace treaty of 201 stipulated that Carthage could neither wage
offensive wars nor defend her remaining African possessions without permission
from Rome. This clause proved fatal.<b><a href="#N_11_">[[11]]</a></b>
</p><p>Like Hiero of Syracuse in the previous generation, Masinissa is an excellent
example of a client king. His rivalry with and eventual triumph over Syphax,
as well as his dramatic love affair with Sophonisba, are part of the larger
story of the rise of P. Cornelius Scipio Africanus and Rome's ultimate
victory. We can be brief. Masinissa provided a cavalry force that was vital
in Scipio's campaigns of 203-202, notably at the decisive battle of Zama.
In return, Scipio formally recognized him as king and presented a scepter
or staff (<i>scipio</i>) in token of his sovereignty. Thus Numidia became
a client state, part of the emerging Roman
<i>imperium</i>.<b><a href="#N_12_">[[12]]</a></b>
</p><p>The borders of Numidia were probably never clearly defined. It is not
simply that Masinissa was shifty, greedy and ambitious, he was certainly
all three but rather that the semi-nomadic Numidians were not accustomed
to thinking in terms of fixed territorial limits or obedience to any central
authority. Masinissa ruled an indeterminate conglomeration of Berber tribes
living west of the Carthaginian state: it was up to him to make this sprawling
assemblage into a kingdom. This he did with considerable success, and we
can point to three major themes. He sponsored the growth of real towns
as market centers and nuclei of royal control, chief among them his favorite
residences at Cirta (Constantine) and Zama Regia (west of Siliana). Second,
he fostered the growth of settled agriculture and with it the slow emergence
of a monetary economy which would gradually replace his people's traditional
semi-transhumant lifestyle. Third, at every possible opportunity he pushed
eastward, nibbling away at lands which Carthage still owned but by the
terms of the treaty of 201 could not defend militarily.
</p><p>As the years went by, repeated border "incidents", Rome's biased verdicts
on appeals for permission to fight or at least to obtain a just arbitration,
and Roman fears over Carthage's economic recovery combined to cause the
outbreak of the Third Punic War in 149. Three years of warfare ended with
the total destruction of the city of Carthage, the formal cursing of its
site (but not, apparently, a ceremonial sowing of salt), and Roman annexation
of Carthage's territory as the new province of Africa.<b><a href="#N_13_">[[13]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b>The Early Years of Provincia Africa, 146-100 B.C.</b></p></center>

<p>Rome's decision to confiscate the lands of her greatest enemy as a new
province is an obvious milestone in the history of North Africa. For the
first time Rome was irrevocably committed to a permanent official presence
on the southern coast of the Mediterranean Sea. The decision was far from
rapacious imperialism, as Rome sought to limit her commitment to the absolute
minimum. She gave the westernmost stretches of Carthage's lands to king
Micipsa of Numidia, who had succeeded Masinissa in 148. Seven towns which
had sided with Rome received a valuable reward: they were declared autonomous
and exempt from taxes, which essentially rendered them enclaves within
the province; one of them, Utica, became the official residence of the
provincial governor, a senator of praetorian rank who held office for a
year. Rome annexed roughly 5000 square miles, delimiting the province's
western boundary with a trench which snaked across the countryside from
Thabraca (Tabarka) on the Mediterranean to Thaenae (near Sfax) on the Gulf
of Gabès. This is the <i>fossa regia</i>, "royal ditch"; its course
is known from stone markers erected during a resurvey carried out in 74/75
A.D. The name is rather a mystery, but can best be understood in the sense
that the king (of Numidia) was henceforth to stay to the west of it;&nbsp;
his days of encroaching on Carthage were over.<b><a href="#N_14_">[[14]]</a></b>
</p><p>As of 146 B.C., then, Rome had an African province and the province
had a border and a governor. We have reached the first stage in the development
of the Roman frontier. But we cannot say much about it. Rome was so little
interested in these lands that a century passed before she paid it much
attention. The province did not have a permanent garrison and few Romans
or Italians took up permanent residence. Gaius Gracchus sponsored a colony
(<i>colonia Junonia</i>) near the cursed site of Carthage in 122, and while
some colonists took up their allotments the colony fizzled when the authorizing
legislation (the <i>lex Rubria</i>) was cancelled in 121. A decade later
an agrarian law confirmed the colonists' ownership of their lands.<b><a href="#N_15_">[[15]]</a></b>
</p><p>Micipsa died in 118 and left Numidia to his two sons, Adherbal and Hiempsal,
and a nephew, Jugurtha. Within a few years Jugurtha proved himself a case
study of what a client king should not be, as he eliminated his cousins,
ignored arbitration by several Roman senatorial embassies, and massacred
a number of Italians and Romans resident at Cirta. The ensuing Jugurthine
War of 112-105 is more important for its ramifications in Roman political
history, the corruption of the ruling <i>nobiles</i>, the rise of Gaius
Marius,&nbsp; and the appearance of Sulla, than for the development of
the African frontier: it was mostly a guerrilla war, with few set battles
and the Romans chasing the wily king all over the countryside. Sallust's
monograph has caused the war to be disproportionally famous. Jugurtha was
taken prisoner to Rome and executed in early 104. He had no direct successors
and the royal line descends from his brother.<b><a href="#N_16_">[[16]]</a></b>
</p><p>The Jugurthine War affected the frontier only marginally; we can note
two points. First, Rome declined to annex more land, and for good reason.
At the time the real crisis was a threatened invasion of Italy by the Germanic
Cimbri and Teutones: Roman armies suffered a string of defeats in 113,
109, 107 and a catastrophe in the lower Rhone valley at Arausio (Orange)
in October, 105. Trying to extract Rome with as little further involvement
as possible, the Senate opted to leave the frontier where it had been since
146, at the <i>fossa regia</i>, and selected Jugurtha's obscure brother
Gauda as the next king. His grandson was Juba I, and at his death in 46
the kingdom was abolished and incorporated into Rome's empire by Caesar.
But before we turn to Caesar, however, we need to note the second legacy
of the Jugurthine War.
</p><p>Marius was the military hero of the war, though his former patron and
commander Q. Caecilius Metellus (cos. 109, procos. 108) disputed his claim
and styled himself "Numidicus" as proof of his own valor, and Marius' quaestor
Sulla boasted of having brought the war to a conclusion by capturing the
king in late 105. No matter. Marius (cos. 107 and procos. 106-105) was
the greatest commander of the day and was promptly elected to repeated
consulships in 104-100 to face the barbarians in Gaul and North Italy.
In 103 (less likely, 100) the tribune L. Appuleius Saturninus passed a
land law by the terms of which some of Marius' veteran soldiers received
grants of land around Uchi Maius in Africa. There is no way of knowing
how many veterans benefited, and the number is not especially important.<b><a href="#N_17_">[[17]]</a></b>
The striking point for us is that these towns were well west of the <i>fossa
regia; </i>they were outside the province and inside the kingdom of Numidia.
<b><a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;wardoc2map2.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=900&quot;)">(See
Map 2.</a></b>) The settlers received their allotments by government grants,
so they are quite different from businessmen and adventurers who entirely
on their own took up residence around the Mediterranean. Settlement of
the Mariani implies a limited commitment to an advance of the frontier.
Africa was the scene of some fighting in the struggle between Marius and
Sulla (whose henchman Pompey campaigned here), but there was no change
in the frontier so we can now move to the policies of Julius Caesar.
</p><center>
<p><b>Julius Caesar and Africa, 46-44 B.C.&nbsp; <a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;wardoc2map2.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=900&quot;)">(See
Map 2.)</a></b></p></center>

<p>The civil war which erupted when Caesar crossed the Rubicon in early
January, 49 soon spread to Africa. Many prominent "Republicans" who refused
to accept the verdict of the battle at Pharsalus in the summer of 48 gathered
in Africa to continue their fight for the cause. A number of the African
towns sided with them. Pompeius Magnus of course was not there, since he
had fled to Egypt and been murdered by the advisors of Ptolemy XIII; but
his two sons Gnaeus and Sextus were present for a time. M. Porcius Cato
is the most famous of the die-hards now and may have been so then. Among
the others we can note the nominal commander Q. Caecilius Metellus Scipio
(cos. 52, Pompey's former father-in-law), T. Labienus (Caesar's legate
in the Gallic Wars), M. Petreius, Faustus Cornelius Sulla, L. Afranius,
and
the provincial governor of Africa, Attius Varus. Joining them was King
Juba I of Numidia. Political necessity, not principles, motivated him:
the Caesarian tribune C. Scribonius Curio in 50 had proposed the annexation
of Numidia, so the king became an anti-Caesarian. For a time he seemed
to have chosen well, as he killed Curio in a battle in 49. For all those
named, the decision was fatal, later if not sooner; for the towns, it was
extremely expensive.<b><a href="#N_18_">[[18]]</a></b> Joining Caesar's
side and profiting greatly in the end was the colorful Campanian <i>condottiere</i>
P. Sittius, hitherto a sort of military advisor to the kings of Mauretania,
Bocchus and Bogud.
</p><p>Having brought some stability to Egypt, Asia Minor and Rome in 48-47,
the dictator Caesar set out for Africa in late 47. Sittius invaded Numidia
from the west, which compelled Juba to withdraw his forces from the Republicans
so as to protect his own kingdom. This relieved some of the pressure on
Caesar, who crushed his enemies at Thapsus in the spring of 46. On learning
of Caesar's victory Cato committed a particularly gruesome suicide; Metellus
Scipio tried to escape by sea but killed himself to avoid capture by Sittius'
fleet. Sittius dispatched Faustus Sulla and Afranius. Labienus and Varus
made it to Spain, but were killed at Munda the next year, as was Gnaeus
Pompeius. Of greater relevance here, Juba was killed in a double assisted
suicide or death pact with Petreius.<b><a href="#N_19_">[[19]]</a></b>
The consequences for Africa were enormous.
</p><p>Caesar abolished the kingdom of Numidia. Instead of adding it to the
existing province he converted it into a new one, Africa Nova, which surrounded
the former province, now known as Vetus ("Old") and remained confined east
of the <i>fossa regia</i>. Nova extended from its border with Mauretania
at the Ampsaga (Kebir) river far to the southeast to the region known as
Tripolitania, so called because of the three cities which dominated it
(<i>tres poleis</i>, Sabratha, Oea and Lepcis Magna: see Maps <a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;wardoc2map3.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=900&quot;)">3</a>
and <a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;wardoc2map5.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=900&quot;)">5</a>).
This area along the shore of the Syrtes Gulf had been of little interest
to the Roman government and individual Romans so far. It had been nominally
subject to the Numidian kings and had supported Cato when he marched his
Republican army through it from Cyrenaica to Numidia in 48/47, so with
the dissolution of the realm it fell to Rome. Caesar levied a stiff fine
on Lepcis Magna and other towns and incorporated the region into Africa
Nova.<b><a href="#N_20_">[[20]]</a></b> The first governor of Africa Nova
was C. Sallustius Crispus, who scandalously plundered it and then retired

As for the Numidian royal family, Caesar took Juba's only heir, a toddler
also named Juba, to Rome. Within a few years the boy wound up in the household
of Caesar's great-niece <b><a href="octania.html">Octavia</a></b>.<b><a href="#N_22_">[[22]]</a></b>
Juba thus grew up surrounded by the imperial princes and princesses: <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>
and Marcellus (born in 42), <b><a href="drusus.html">Drusus</a></b> (born
39), two Marcellas, Iullus Antonius, and the two Antonias (Maior and <b><a href="antoniaminor.html">Minor</a></b>).
</p><p>Caesar rewarded his friends as liberally as he punished his foes severely.
Sittius profited handsomely, as he received a large block of territory
around Cirta. Although this "principality" was surrounded by Africa Nova,
Sittius was to have been practically an independent sovereign. He distributed
land to his followers; inscriptions reveal many Sittii all through the
area and the so-called Cirtan "confederation" flourished for roughly a
century and a half. (Around 110 A.D. Trajan broke it up and granted colonial
rank to Cirta and four other towns: (see Part 4.) Sittius himself was killed
in the confused fighting in 44-43.<b><a href="#N_23_">[[23]]</a></b>
</p><p>One other aspect of Caesar's policies toward Africa must be noted. He
founded four colonies on the Cap Bon peninsula: Carpis (Korbous), Clupea
(Kelibia), Curubis (Korba), and Neapolis (Nabeul). It is possible that
there were other colonies and non-colonial settlements as well which lie
undiscovered or lost their identity on being absorbed into later towns.
More important, he took up Gaius Gracchus' old idea and founded a colony
adjacent to the site of Carthage. Departing from centuries of Roman colonial
policy, he attached to Carthage the lands assigned to the recipients of
grants under the legislation of Gracchus and Saturninus (i.e., Marius'
veterans). The effect of this was that Carthage had an enormous and probably
discontinuous <i>territorium</i> or <i>pertica</i> (administrative district)
which even extended into Africa Nova.<b><a href="#N_24_">[[24]]</a></b>
</p><div><p>In summary, then, Caesar did not spend much time in Africa; he left
for Rome by the summer of 46 and never returned, but his policies revolutionized
the Roman commitment to the area. For a century Rome had paid minimal attention&nbsp;
to her African province. Henceforth, Rome had two African provinces which
covered a great expanse of territory and included a number of formally-founded
colonies and were attracting a growing number of settlers, particularly
ambitious businessmen and owners of large estates producing for the Italian
and Roman markets. These provinces now had to be protected, and that required
commitment of military resources and a more developed sense of a frontier.
Many Berber peoples opposed the increasing Roman presence; and the sources
speak of much warfare in the following years and for the first time a standing
garrison.

</p><p><b>The Creation of Africa Proconsularis and the</b>
</p><p><b>Early Years of the Province</b></p></center>

<p>The history of Rome in the years after Caesar's death in 44 is extremely
complicated. In spite of the efforts of moderates to keep a fragile peace,
civil war broke out over the winter of 44-43 and endured with intervals
of uneasy quiet until 30. In the first few years Africa was the site of
its own vicious but localized war between T. Sextius and Q. Cornificius,
the governors of Nova and Vetus respectively. The primary narrators of
these years, Appian and Dio Cassius, were mostly interested in the drama
of Antony's initial dalliance with Cleopatra and the increasingly nasty
squabbles between him and <b><a href="auggie.html">Octavian</a></b> and
paid minimal attention to Africa, so we can reconstruct only a bald outline
of what happened.
</p><p>By early 42 Sextius had won both the war and the title of <i>imperator</i>
and Cornificius was dead: that is round one.<b><a href="#N_25_">[[25]])</a></b>In
the meantime, in Italy the leaders of the Caesarian faction had put aside
their differences and come together in the Second Triumvirate: M. Antonius,
M. Aemilius Lepidus, and Caesar's adopted son <b><a href="auggie.html">C.
Julius Caesar Octavianus</a></b>. They defeated the faction of the Republicans
or Liberators at Philippi in October, 42; Cassius and Brutus committed
suicide. The triumvirs then divided up the provinces among themselves.
Africa fell to <b><a href="auggie.html">Octavian</a></b>, who sent in Q.
Fuficius Fango. Sextius dutifully turned over both provinces to him, but,
loyal
to Antony and regarding Fango as <b><a href="auggie.html">Octavian's
</a></b>man,
he remained in Africa. In 41 Antony urged Sextius to expel Fango, which
he soon did. Fango's allies fell away or were killed, and he retreated
to the mountains and committed suicide by early 40. Once again, Sextius
governed both African provinces: round two.<b><a href="#N_26_">[[26]]</a></b>
</p><p>At the end of 40, Lepidus himself took up the governorship of the Africas.
He brought six legions, picked up Sextius' four, and recruited six more
within a couple of years. The treaty of Brundisium in 39 confirmed his
status. Sextius disappears from the record. Unfortunately, very little
is known of Lepidus' tenure of Africa, which lasted until the fall of 36:
round three. He is said to have broken up or at least severely damaged
Caesar's colony at Carthage. He did not bother the other foundations, so
the suspicion is that Lepidus as Pontifex Maximus may have used religious
scruples to justify his harsh treatment: the colony had in some way violated
the curse.<b><a href="#N_27_">[[27]]</a></b> True, the turmoil of civil
war is not a fair test of his designs and its viability, but the distinction
between Vetus and Nova was proving a failure. Lepidus governed both provinces
as, for that matter, had Sextius and Fango. Admitting that certainty is
unattainable, it looks as though Lepidus himself formally consolidated
the two provinces into one, and that henceforth there was a single Africa
which from 27 B.C. onward was called Proconsularis.<b><a href="#N_28_">[[28]]</a></b>
Lepidus fell from power in the fall of 36, and from then on <b><a href="auggie.html">Octavian</a></b>
controlled Africa.
</p><p>Many historians argue that the provinces were combined as part of the
so-called Settlement of 27 B.C., customarily taken to mark the opening
of the reign of <b><a href="auggie.html">Octavian</a></b> (who became <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
at this time) and thus the birth of the Empire period.<b><a href="#N_29_">[[29]]</a></b>
In the long run, of course, and in terms of the development of the frontier,
the nine years 36-27 do not make much difference, but a summary of the
case for a date 40-36 is worthwhile. There is no sign of the two-province
arrangement after Cornificius' demise. All known governors were of Africa
as a single entity. Three of<b><a href="auggie.html"> Octavian's</a></b>
generals celebrated triumphs <i>ex Africa</i>: T. Statilius Taurus in 34,
L. Cornificius in 33 or 32, and L. Autronius Paetus in 28. In 32 the apparently
united province of Africa took the oath of allegiance to <b><a href="auggie.html">Octavian</a></b>
as
<i>dux</i> for the Actian campaign.<b><a href="#N_30_">[[30]]</a></b>
In conclusion, then, probably from 40/36 B.C. there was one province of
Africa and it extended from Arae Philaenorum at the eastern end of Tripolitania
and the border with Cyrenaica to the Ampsaga river, beyond which lay Mauretania.
</p><p>Mauretania itself is worth a quick glance, as events there also affected
the emerging frontier. The client kings Bogud in the far west and Bocchus
adjacent to Numidia-become-Nova were dead by 31. The status of the realm
until 25 is unclear. No rulers are known and <b><a href="auggie.html">Octavian
(Augustus</a></b> from 27) was too busy to give it much thought. In these
years, however, he founded a series of colonies along the Mediterranean
littoral and the plain at the northwest tip of the continent. <a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;wardoc2map3a.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=900&quot;)">(<b>See
Map 3a</b></a>.) This is highly peculiar. These colonies were not in a
Roman province. In 25 <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b> gave Mauretania
a king and queen: Juba II, son of Juba I (d. 46 B.C.), and Cleopatra Selene,
daughter of Antony and Cleopatra of Egypt. The colonies were still an administrative
oddity: inside a foreign kingdom but presumably exempt from the king's
powers and ultimately dependent on the distant proconsul.<b><a href="#N_31_">[[31]]</a></b>
Settled by veterans, the colonies were probably supposed to help shore
up Juba's control of his restless subjects for a few years (until the settlers
got too old) and he was to reciprocate as best he could. As appears below,
this experimental arrangement proved unsuccessful in the long run. Juba
and his successor Ptolemy were unable to provide stability within their
kingdom and in the late 30s A.D. Ptolemy was removed from the throne and
the kingdom abolished by 43. That in turn led immediately to the annexation
of Mauretania as two Roman provinces.
</p><center>
<p><b><i>Legio III Augusta</i></b></p></center>

<p>It is universally recognized that the Roman army became a professional
fighting force in the Empire: soldiers served for long terms, were paid
regularly, and took oaths of allegiance to the emperor; provinces received
permanent garrisons and (at least marginally) better government as Rome
accepted responsibility for the administration and protection of the empire
she had been acquiring since the 220s B.C. The core of the African army
was <i>legio III Augusta</i>, in the first years of the empire commanded
by the provincial governor, the proconsul of consular rank. (In the reign
of Caligula this changed: see below.) Straightaway, however, we face a
problem: where was the Third Augusta's <i>hiberna</i>, literally its winter
quarters but in effect its home base, under <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
and his immediate successors?
</p><p>Raised by Pansa in 43 or <b><a href="auggie.html">Octavian</a></b> in
the crisis of 41, <i>III Augusta</i> was in Africa by 30 B.C.<b><a href="#N_32_">[[32]]</a></b>
By the end of <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus'</a></b> reign in A.D. 14
the principal base of the legion was Ammaedara: construction crews were
building a road from the <i>hiberna</i> to the port of Tacapae in that
year, and the road points to Ammaedara.<b><a href="#N_33_">[[33]]</a></b>
Excavations adjacent to the later colony and modern town have apparently
located the fortress specifically at the junction of the two main streets,
gates, and lengths of wall. The site was at first an area of 25-30 acres,
or between half and two-thirds the size of a full fortress, and was built
late in the reign of <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>, after the
Gaetulian War ended in 6/7.<b><a href="#N_34_">[[34]]</a></b> If only five
cohorts were here, where were the other five? One was on rota at Carthage
as escort for the proconsul, so we need to find forts for four more cohorts,
and this is a problem as they could have been stationed as a block or scattered
in two or four small forts. Mattingly has suggested a "vexillation fortress"
"for a few years ... somewhere in the region" of Tripolitania, but he does
not guess a place. LeBohec has made a case for a portion of the legion
being at or near Sicca Veneria, which was a road junction.<b><a href="#N_35_">[[35]]</a></b>
There is no archaeological evidence for a fort, and Sicca was an Augustan
colony, which could also explain the roads. For this reason it seems possible
that a portion of the Third was stationed for a few years somewhere a bit
farther west, in the old Numidian kingdom and closer to Cirta; Madaurus
(M'daourouch) is attractive. If these proposals are correct, then we must
envision <i>III Augusta</i> broken up so as to anchor a screen around the
western and southeastern fringes of the old province of Proconsularis and
well within the boundaries of the consolidated Vetus plus Nova. Auxiliary
units must have filled in some of the gaps between Sicca, Ammaedara and
Tripolitania.
</p><p>The fortress at Ammaedara was later expanded to at least 40 acres, maybe
50, enough to house most of the legion, all of it at a squeeze. Perhaps
the expansion came around 24/25, when the war against Tacfarinas concluded.
Any cohorts previously in Tripolitania likely left when <i>IX Hispana</i>
arrived in 20 and were not sent back when the Ninth departed in 24. Any
around Sicca or elsewhere in the north could have moved to Ammaedara at
the same time. The legion stayed here until transferred to Theveste in
75 (see Part 4). At that point, Vespasian used the decommissioned fortress
for a colony, as was frequently done elsewhere. Given that Vespasian founded
another colony at Madauros, one wonders if a fort for a couple of cohorts
might not lie undiscovered there rather than at Sicca. Only archaeological
discoveries can settle the point. What we can say, then, is that by 14
Ammaedara was the <i>hiberna</i> of <i>III Augusta</i>, the base camp for
at least half the legion and the location of its <i>principia</i> or HQ
building and <i>praetorium</i> or legate's residence. <i>Legio III Augusta</i>
was the only legion in Africa west of the Nile and remained Africa's garrison
thereafter, probably the most stationary in the empire.<b><a href="#N_36_">[[36]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b>The Gaetulian War (3 B.C-A.D. 6) and the</b>
</p><p><b>Revolt of Tacfarinas (A.D. 17-24)</b></p></center>

<p>In spite of a number of campaigns in the early years of <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>,
culminating in the celebrated campaign of L. Cornelius Balbus in 20-19
B.C. against the Garamantes and other native peoples loosely labeled Gaetulians
by the ancient writers who didn't bother with careful distinctions among
the countless tribes, Africa remained an unquiet province. In fact, there
was far more fighting in this supposedly peaceful land than in any other
senatorial province. Many tribes were unwilling to accept the fact of Roman
imperial rule or subordination even to Juba of Mauretania. Ethnically Juba
was himself of native stock, but culturally he had "gone Roman" and this
combined with his Roman backing condemned him in the eyes of some of those
whom he was supposed to rule. Fighting broke out again in 3 B.C., spread
all across the ill-defined southern reaches of Roman Africa but was evidently
heaviest in Tripolitania, and lasted until 6 A.D.: the so-called <i>Bellum
Gaetulicum</i>.<b><a href="#N_37_">[[37]]</a></b> Rome suffered initial
reverses but soon recovered. One of the commanders may have been Sulpicius
Quirinius, best (but wrongly) known as legate of Syria at the time of the
birth of Jesus. L. Cornelius Lentulus died while proconsul in A.D. 1. His
successor, L. Passienus Rufus, won <i>ornamenta triumphalia</i> in 3. Within
the next year or two Juba cut short his stay in Cappadocia and hurried
back to be of assistance in the war against the Gaetulians.<b><a href="#N_38_">[[38]]</a></b>
</p><p>At some point <i>Legio XII Fulminata</i> (perhaps a detachment rather
than the whole legion) provided reinforcements to <i>III Augusta</i>; when
it arrived is not clear, but it stayed through the final victory. After
Cossus Cornelius Lentulus won,&nbsp; he tactfully declined excessive honors;
his son perhaps presumptuously took the honorific name Gaetulicus and came
to a bad end in the reign of <b><a href="gaius.html">Caligula</a></b>.<b><a href="#N_39_">[[39]]</a></b>
Rome punished the rebels by confiscating parts of their land and by increasing
her troop presence in the vicinity, possibly stationing a detachment of
<i>III
Augusta</i> somewhere in western Tripolitania.
</p><p>The eight years of fighting against Tacfarinas are perhaps better considered
a revolt rather than a war because the action took place within Proconsularis
and the client kingdom of Mauretania. Rome neither conquered new territory
nor fought beyond the vague frontiers. Tacfarinas himself was at least
partly Romanized as he had served in the auxiliaries and may have had citizenship;
in these respects he is similar to the other notable rebels of the day,
Arminius the German chieftain and the Gauls Julius Florus and Julius Sacrovir.<b><a href="#N_40_">[[40]]</a></b>
Tacfarinas was a Musulamian, and the Roman settlement, roads and military
garrisons had been encroaching on and slicing through his people's lands.
The road from Carthage through Sicca to Cirta ran along the northern edge
of the tribe's territory, and that from Ammaedara to Theveste cut through
it. Anger at the growing and apparently limitless Roman presence had doubtless
been building for years and carried over from the Gaetulian War. Tacfarinas
provided leadership, a charismatic personality, and familiarity with Roman
military operations. A defeat at the hands of the proconsul Furius Camillus
in 17 taught him a lesson the hard way. Thereafter he avoided set battles
and ranged far and wide across the interior.<b><a href="#N_41_">[[41]]</a></b>
</p><p>The heartland of the insurgency was the area around Ammaedara, precisely
where Rome had recently established the principal fortress of <i>III Augusta</i>.
Rome doubtless felt that the Musulamii needed close supervision, and the
natives equally doubtless got yet angrier at the conquerors. Fighting in
the next few years showed that <i>Legio III</i> was going to have a tough
time. Probably still often divided into two or even three vexillations,
the legion could either garrison the towns or strike at Tacfarinas if it
could catch him, but not do both simultaneously. There was too much territory
to cover and heavy infantry was too slow. Even with its more mobile auxiliaries,
the Third needed help. In 20 the emperor Tiberius sent <i>IX Hispana</i>
from Pannonia to garrison Lepcis Magna and presumably Oea and Sabratha
as well against raids by the Garamantes.<b><a href="#N_42_">[[42]]</a></b>
If a couple of cohorts from the Third had been in Tripolitania, they could
now join the rest of the legion and concentrate operations in the Musulamian
homeland.
</p><p>Another point is relevant here. The client rulers of Mauretania had
been unable to keep the revolt from spreading into their own lands. Aged
65 in 17, Juba II was probably too old to take the field effectively and
his heir Ptolemy, associated as co-regent from 17, was evidently no general.<b><a href="#N_43_">[[43]]</a></b>
All the more reason to concentrate <i>III Augusta</i> in the area from
Ammaedara to the upper Bagradas valley and let <i>IX Hispana</i> protects
the eastern flank.
</p><p>We do not need to follow the fighting. A succession of proconsuls directed
operations with varying results. Two won <i>ornamenta triumphalia</i> (Camillus
in 17 and Junius Blaesus in 22) and a third had at least as good a claim
but political considerations prevented the award (P. Cornelius Dolabella
in 24, denied so as not to diminish the glory of Blaesus, uncle of the
powerful praetorian prefect Sejanus). Tacitus provides highlights, not
a continuous narrative, and he jumps from place to place in such a way
that we cannot follow developments; of course, guerrilla warfare has no
clear fronts or theaters. Fighting was kept well outside the old <i>fossa
regia</i> and thus away from the richest part of the province.<b><a href="#N_44_">[[44]]</a></b>
In one interesting description Tacitus tells us that the legate Scipio
fought the Garamantes in Tripolitania while Blaesus' son protected Cirta
and Blaesus himself screened the swath of land between his subordinates
(<i>Ann.</i> 3.74). In 24 Cornelius Dolabella pushed Tacfarinas far to
the west and surprised him at Auzia (Souk el Ghoziane). In the battle Tacfarinas
committed suicide by rushing headlong into a hail of missiles.
</p><p>The chief consequence of the Tacfarinan revolt for our purposes is that
it revealed both the ongoing high level of native refusal to acquiesce
in Roman rule and the inability of the Mauretanian client kings to do what
was expected of them. Juba evidently died near the end of the fighting,
as in the immediate aftermath, in the ancestral fashion (<i>vetusto more</i>)
senators were dispatched to Ptolemy to recognize him as king and bestow
rewards (an ivory scepter or <i>scipio</i>, deliberately recalling the
<i>scipio</i>
which Scipio Africanus gave to Masinissa way back in the closing stages
of the second Punic War, and a <i>toga picta, antiqua patrum munera</i>).<b><a href="#N_45_">[[45]]</a></b>
Without doubt, however, we can infer that these same senators delivered
a stern message to the new king: Rome expected a higher level of military
competence. Ptolemy either didn't take the message seriously or was simply
unable to perform up to expectations. Fifteen years later he was removed.
</p><center>
<p><b><i>Legio III Augusta</i>: from proconsul to legate</b></p></center>

<p>A peculiarity of Proconsularis, noted above, is that the proconsul whom
the Senate appointed was also the commander of the province's military,
the most important component of which was of course the Third Augustan
legion. <b><a href="gaius.html">Caligula</a></b> terminated this anomaly,
but in doing so he created another one. He removed the legion from the
proconsul and assigned it (and the auxiliaries) to an officer of his own
choosing, called a legate. The new emperor was young at his accession (only
25), untrained for the job, totally uninterested in the work of imperial
administration, and in no sense a military man. One wonders, in fact, whether
old <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b> might have had the shift
from proconsul to legate on his agenda and never got around to it. There
is no hint of this in the sources and <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>
was isolated and in a steady mental decline his last years, but none the
less he had had enormous military experience under Augustus and might have
thought the transfer of command a wise act. The precise date of the changeover
is not known. If <b><a href="gaius.html">Caligula</a></b> did it soon after
becoming emperor, say in 37, we might feel more confident in attributing
the decision to <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius'
</a></b>plans than
if the change belongs as late as 40.
</p><p>In any case, <b><a href="gaius.html">Caligula</a></b> removed the proconsul
and replaced him with a
<i>legatus</i>. The difference is this. The proconsular
governor of Africa was a senior senator, who had held the consulship some
years earlier, often as many as ten, so he could easily be in his early
50s. The legate was also a senator, but a much younger one, of praetorian
rank. His hopes for promotions were at the emperor's discretion. In this
sense, the change brought Africa into conformity with standard practice:
legionary commanders were all imperial appointees, with the title <i>legatus
Augusti pro praetore legionis (-)</i>, "propraetorian legate of the Emperor
of legion (-)." A legate's <i>imperium</i>, power of command, was thus
specifically defined as inferior to the "greater proconsular power", <i>imperium
proconsulare maius,</i> of the emperor (the Augustus). The governors of
the other senatorial provinces, all of them called proconsuls, did not
command legions; the only province that had status comparable to Africa's
was Asia, perhaps the most peaceful province in the entire Empire. Conversely,
all legionary legates were the emperor's men, which left the emperor as
clearly the commander-in-chief of the imperial military establishment.
</p><p><b><a href="gaius.html">Caligula </a></b>created a fresh anomaly, perhaps
a double one. Because the emperor did not alter the provincial borders,
the proconsul continued to be responsible for the civil administration
of all lands to the border of Mauretania at the Ampsaga river. The legionary
legate was his subordinate in civil and judicial matters, just as he was
the emperor's subordinate in military matters. In effect, however, the
legate was a governor and the military zone, Numidia but also the southern
portions of Tripolitania, was a province in all but name.
</p><p><b><a href="gaius.html">Caligula's</a></b> motivation for this change
is uncertain, as is the date. If scholars could attribute a sense of responsibility
and maturity to him, it would be tempting to think he was concerned to
increase administrative efficiency. After all, Proconsularis was a vast
province and one could not expect the proconsul to direct the civil government,
tour the province to hold court at regional centers, and command an army
which had had to cope with more or less constant native unrest and several
large-scale revolts. Besides, proconsuls generally held office for only
one year, which was frequently militarily inefficient. Legates served at
the emperor's pleasure, though a three-year appointment soon became standard.
The ancient sources, however, attribute a far more mundane reason to the
suspicious emperor: fear. <b><a href="gaius.html">Caligula</a></b> was perversely
fond of insulting individual senators and the Senate as a body, but he
was also insecure and mentally unstable. He was afraid of possible consequences
if high-ranking senators, particularly those whom he regarded as personal
enemies, governed wealthy provinces which contained armies. So he simply
deprived the prestigious proconsul of Africa of his troops. The move simultaneously
belittled the Senate.
</p><p>Tacitus (<i>Hist.</i> 4.48) says <b><a href="gaius.html">Caligula</a></b>
feared M. Junius Silanus (cos. 19) and removed the legion from him while
he was proconsul in 36-39. (Proconsuls normally served for one year, but
even if extended the term ran for twelve months from mid-calendar year.)
Dio Cassius (59.20) reports that the emperor was afraid of L. Calpurnius
Piso (cos. 27) and took away the legion before he took up his governorship.
There probably is something to this. With good reason <b><a href="gaius.html">Caligula</a></b>
was wary of plots against him, and he may well have disliked and feared
both of these men. Silanus' bloodline and marriage tied him closely to
the imperial house: his wife was an Aemilia Lepida, and her mother was
<a href="juliaminor.html"><b>Julia
Minor</b>,</a>&nbsp; <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus'</a></b> granddaughter.
Aemilia Lepida's brother was himself involved in the poorly understood
conspiracy of Lentulus Gaetulicus in 38. A second branch of the Junii Silani
produced cousins to Marcus who were consuls in 10 and 15, another one in
28. Silanus could easily be seen as the front for an anti-Caligula coup.
The family was exceedingly prominent and ill-starred, as a number of its
members met untimely demises under <b><a href="gaius.html">Caligula</a></b>,
<b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>
and <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b> who felt them too close kin for
comfort.<b><a href="#N_46_">[[46]]</a></b> Piso was the son of the Cn.
Piso and Munatia Plancina who were popularly believed to have been behind
the untimely and suspicious death of <b><a href="gaius.html">Caligula's</a></b>
father <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b> in 19 and the humiliation
suffered by his mother <b><a href="aggiei.html">Agrippina the Elder</a></b>
at the hands of <b><a href="tioberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>,
<b><a href="livia.html">Livia</a></b>
and Sejanus. It may well be that we can combine Tacitus and Dio by arguing
that <b><a href="gaius.html">Caligula</a></b> removed the legion from the
proconsul at the end of Silanus' term and before Piso arrived. It's a tangled
mass of hypotheses and nothing can be proved. It is not even certain that
Piso was the immediate successor of Silanus, whose term ended in the summer
of 39, and Piso's may not have begun until the following summer. There
may have been one proconsul in between them.<b><a href="#N_47_">[[47]]</a></b>
</p><p>One other point needs to be considered. We have seen that the change
from proconsul to legate cannot be more closely dated than sometime between
37 and 40. Another of <b><a href="gaius.html">Caligula's</a></b> decisions
affecting Africa cannot be precisely dated: he summoned the client king
of Mauretania, Ptolemy, to Rome in 38 and sometime thereafter had him executed.
Does an underlying policy connect these moves? The ancient sources do not
mention one, and nobody has ever credited <b><a href="gaius.html">Caligula</a></b>
with long-range administrative planning. Ancient writers were more interested
in scandal and misconduct than in policies which never got wide publicity
anyway: the public at large did not care about proconsuls and legates in
distant Africa. Modern historians, with wider interests, tend to see things
differently. Installed in 25 B.C., the rulers of Mauretania had never performed
up to expectations during the various wars, and Rome probably felt their
shortcomings had contributed to the difficulty in suppressing Tacfarinas
in the period between 17 and 24. In all likelihood Rome planned to annex
Mauretania in the not too distant future, and <b><a href="gaius.html">Caligula</a></b>
simply speeded up the process by eliminating Ptolemy rather than waiting
for him to die. Once Mauretania was part of the Empire, Rome would be responsible
for establishing and maintaining the peace all the way across to the Atlantic
coast. Clearly the proconsul of Africa could not do this; better to give
military responsibilities to a separate person. But this supposition does
not get rid of difficulties for us. Rome did not shift the HQ of <i>III
Augusta</i> westward and did not send in another legion for the Mauretanian
frontier. Because <b><a href="gaius.html">Caligula</a></b> was assassinated
before the formal annexation occurred, the final decisions were those of<b><a href="claudius.html">
Claudius'</a></b>&nbsp; government in 43/44. The old client kingdom was
divided into two provinces which were assigned to equestrian procurators
and garrisoned by auxiliaries. (For all this, see the following section.)
</p><center>
<p><b>The End of the Client Kingdom and the</b>
</p><p><b>Annexation of Mauretania, A.D. 38/40-43</b></p></center>

<p>"The circumstances under which Mauretania was incorporated within the
Roman Empire are notoriously uncertain."<b><a href="#N_48_">[[48]]</a></b>
</p><p>The outline of events is not a problem. Ptolemy succeeded his father
Juba II in 23 or 24. From March of 37 the emperor was <b><a href="gaius.html">Caligula</a></b>,
a cousin-once-removed to the client king. (Both descend from Mark Antony:
Ptolemy's mother was Cleopatra Selene, daughter of Antony and Cleopatra
of Egypt; <b><a href="gaius.html">Caligula's</a></b> father <b><a href="germanicus.html">Germanicus</a></b>
was the son of <b><a href="antoniaminor.html">Antonia,</a></b> daughter
of Antony and Octavia.) In 38 or 40 <b><a href="gaius.html">Caligula</a></b>
ordered Ptolemy to come to Rome and executed him some months later. <b><a href="gaius.html">Caligula</a></b>
himself was killed in January 41, the first imperial assassination, and
followed by <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b>. The new emperor's
generals Suetonius Paullinus, Hosidius Geta and Licinius Crassus put down
the revolt of Aedemon, defeated Moorish nomads deep in the Atlas, and annexed
the kingdom. By 43 or 44 <b><a href="claudius.html">Claudius</a></b> had
established the provinces of Mauretania Caesariensis (capital at Iol Caesarea)
and Tingitana (at Tingi). The governors were equestrian procurators, not
senatorial proconsuls or imperial legates, and auxiliaries provided the
garrison: these were not to be very important provinces.
</p><p>The precise chronology and <b><a href="gaius.html">Caligula's
</a></b>motivation
are much debated. If not incompetent, Ptolemy was certainly not distinguished
as a ruler or sufficiently tactful where the infamously suspicious <b><a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a></b>
and <b><a href="gaius.html">Caligula</a></b> were concerned. He issued gold
coins but should have confined himself to bronzes and the occasional silver.
<b><a href="gaius.html">Caligula</a></b>
may have thought he was involved in the (obscure) conspiracy of Gaetulicus,
and once in Rome Ptolemy was careless in wearing a purple robe. Ptolemy's
fate was unique, as no other client king was executed. When Rome took over
a client state the normal technique was to do so on the death of a ruler,
or alternatively to depose and exile the king.<b><a href="#N_49_">[[49]]</a></b>
</p><p>Ptolemy's fate aside, however, Roman annexation of his sprawling kingdom
roughly doubled the length of the frontier in Africa. From 43 on, Rome
and not a client ruler was responsible for security from the Ampsaga river
westward to the Atlantic coast. Note, however, that Rome left <i>legio
III Augusta</i> at Ammaedara, deep within Proconsularis. As noted above,
in 37-40 <b><a href="gaius.html">Caligula</a></b> had removed the legion
from the command of the proconsul and replaced him with an imperial legate.
A direct connection between change in command and annexation of Mauretania
cannot be demonstrated. Scattered auxiliary units were to suffice for the
two new Mauretanian provinces. Further, Rome never pushed very far inland
from the Mediterranean in Caesariensis, where urbanization was confined
to the coastal colonies <b><a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;wardoc2map3a.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=900&quot;)">(See
Map 3a)</a></b>, and never occupied the Atlas and Rif ranges in Tingitana,
only the coastal plain and straits. Tingitana always had closer ties to
Baetica in southern Spain than to Caesariensis.

<p><b><u>4. The African Frontier in the Reigns of the Flavians and Trajan,
A.D. 69-117.</u></b> (See Map 4)</p></center>

<p>The reigns of the three Flavian emperors, <b><a href="nerva.html">Nerva</a></b>,
and <b><a href="trajan.html">Trajan</a></b> extend for almost a half-century,
and taken together they form a coherent period. In the 70s <b><a href="vespasia.html">Vespasian</a></b>
initiated and his successors continued a policy of careful but decisive
expansion to the west and southwest. Decisions we can attribute to <b><a href="trajan.html">Trajan</a></b>
are pretty clearly the completion of ideas that originated under <b><a href="vespasia.html">Vespasian</a></b>.
The army did not simply advance and leave a vacuum in its wake: development
of the frontier zone accompanied expansion. By the death of <b><a href="trajan.html">Trajan
</a></b>in
117 Rome had moved the fortress of <i>III Augusta</i> about 120 miles from
Ammaedara west to Lambaesis. To encourage settlement of this huge area
now open to development Rome had founded at least seven <i>coloniae</i>,
raised several other towns to colonial rank, granted a number of other
towns the status of <i>municipium</i>, and was well on the way to linking
these places to one another and to the already developed portion of the
province through an expanding network of roads.<b><a href="#N_50_">[[50]]</a></b>
As appears in Part 5, <b><a href="hadrian.html">Hadrian</a></b> rounded
off these developments in the period between 117-138, for convenience treated
as a separate stage.
</p><p>No ancient writer describes this achievement; Tacitus' <i>Histories</i>
are lost after a few chapters of book 5; the missing seven and a half books
must have contained passages on the campaigns in Africa, and may have mentioned
the colonial foundations as well. Suetonius was not interested in provincial
affairs. Dio Cassius is extant only in Byzantine excerptors. Contemporaries
were probably unaware of Rome's accomplishments in Africa and would not
have understood their historical significance had they followed the course
of events. Archaeological and epigraphical discoveries provide the basis
for modern reconstruction of developments.<b><a href="#N_51_">[[51]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b>The Civil War of 68/69</b></p></center>

<p>The so-called "year of the four emperors" was the first civil war in
the Roman world since the great upheavals of the 40s and 30s B.C. On that
occasion, as noted above, Africa had its own private civil war in the period
between 44 and 40, a nasty but localized contest at the core of which was
T. Sextius. We find a sort of reprise in 68/69. The legionary legate Clodius
Macer revolted against <b><a href="nero.html">Nero</a></b> in the spring
of 68, but when he thereafter refused to cooperate with <b><a href="galba.html">Galba</a></b>,
the latter had him eliminated, and that ended round one.<b><a href="#N_52_">[[52]]</a><a href="otho.html">Otho</a></b>
replaced <b><a href="galba.html">Galba</a></b> in January of 69, and Africa
accepted him as emperor. In return, he granted unspecified <i>nova iura</i>,
presumably fiscal or judicial privileges.
<b><a href="otho.html">Otho</a></b>
lasted but four months, as <b><a href="vitell.html">Vitellius</a></b>' army
eliminated <b><a href="otho.html">Otho'</a></b>s in north Italy. Africa
smoothly geared over to the new emperor and accepted without initial difficulty
as proconsul L. Calpurnius Piso. This we can call round two. Troubles quickly
loomed on the eastern horizon, where <b><a href="vespasia.html">T. Flavius
Vespasianus</a></b>, special commander of the Roman armies against the
Jewish revolt since 66, was proclaimed emperor in July. <b><a href="vespasia.html">Vespasian
</a></b>had
been proconsul of Africa in 62/63 and the little we know of his administration
is that he had not been wildly popular.
</p><p>The legate of <i>III Augusta</i>, Valerius Festus, saw an opportunity
to influence history and profit personally. He calculated that <b><a href="vitell.html">Vitellius
</a></b>would
not ultimately prevail in the Empire at large, and, boldly taking the lead
in swinging Africa over to <b><a href="vespasia.html">Vespasian</a></b>,
arranged for the assassination of the proconsul. This left Festus essentially
in charge of Africa and enabled him to cut off the grain convoys to Rome
just as <b><a href="vespasia.html">Vespasian </a></b>was doing from Alexandria.
By December <b><a href="vespasia.html">Vespasian's</a></b> armies had won
possession of all Italy and eliminated <b><a href="vitell/htm">Vitellius</a></b>:
Rome had a new emperor. In 70 Festus drove his army against the Garamantes
who had been attacking Lepcis. <b><a href="vespasia.html">Vespasian
</a></b>rewarded
his African supporter swiftly and handsomely with a full complement of
military decorations and a suffect consulship in 71, followed by provincial
governorships. Round three ends the civil war.<b><a href="#N_53_">[[53]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b>The Flavian Advance</b></p></center>

<p>Rome had not extended her holdings in Africa in many years: the war
that accompanied the annexation of the Mauretanian client kingdom in 43
was almost the only fighting since the suppression of Tacfarinas in 24.
Once <b><a href="vespasia.html">Vespasian</a></b> was certain of the province's
security and loyalty, he turned to expansion in about 75. As a preliminary
he ordered the specially appointed legate C. Rutilius Gallicus and the
legionary legate Sex. Sentius Caecilianus to resurvey the old <i>fossa
regia</i>.<b><a href="#N_54_">[[54]]</a></b> Nobody is sure why he did
this, as the <i>fossa</i> had not been a provincial boundary since the
amalgamation of Vetus and Nova in the period 40-36. (See above in Part
3.) One purpose may have been to establish the eastern limits of the legate's
powers. The proconsul had at least nominal authority all the way to the
Ampsaga river, but the legionary legate was <i>de facto</i> governor in
the old province of Nova: perhaps it was deemed wise to clarify how far
eastward his competence extended. Gallicus, who was of consular rank (suffect
sometime 70/72) when he came to Africa, was active in Tripolitania in 74,
where he determined the boundary between Lepcis Magna and Oea.<b><a href="#N_55_">[[55]]</a></b>
In 75 Caecilianus, now a special propraetorian legate of both Mauretanias,
strove to bring order to these often restless lands.<b><a href="#N_56_">[[56]]</a></b>
</p><p>In the mid-70s <i>legio III Augusta</i> moved from Ammaedara to Theveste
(Tebessa), possibly the first fortress large enough to hold the entire
legion as Ammaedara would have been a tight fit (see above). This is a
very short move, only about 25 miles, though nowadays it takes one across
the Tunisian-Algerian border. The old, now decommissioned fortress became
Colonia Flavia Augusta Emerita Ammaedara; as the name indicates, it was
specifically for veteran soldiers (<i>emeriti</i>). Simultaneously, Madaurus
(M'daourouch) became Colonia Flavia Augusta Veteranorum. A road linked
Theveste to Hippo Regius on the Mediterranean just as in 14 a road went
from Ammaedara to Tacapae.<b><a href="#N_57_">[[57]]</a></b> All of this
finds a close parallel in Britain. In the early and mid-70s <i>legio II
Augusta</i> moved from Glevum to Isca (Gloucester to Caerleon)&nbsp; only
about 40 miles; and <i>IX Hispana</i> moved from Lindum to Eburacum (Lincoln
to York) about 50 miles. Within a few years both old fortresses became
colonies.
</p><p>Immediately after the Third Augusta was housed at Theveste, the army
established a string of auxiliary forts westward along the northern face
of the Aurès mountains: Vazaivi, perhaps Mascula or Aquae Flavianae,
and in 81 at Lambaesis where L. Tettius Julianus built a small fort which
precedes by 35 or 40 years the legionary fortress.<b><a href="#N_58_">[[58]]</a></b>
(See Maps 4 and <a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;wardoc2map6.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=900&quot;)">6</a>.)
Not long afterwards auxiliary forts appeared yet farther west, at Verecunda
(Markouna), Lamasba (Merouana), Diana Veteranorum (Zana) and Auzia. Taken
together, these forts screened the lands to the north which were undergoing
rapid settlement and agricultural exploitation. The towns around Cirta
were flourishing and in the 90s Nerva founded colonies straddling the border
between Proconsularis and Caesariensis at Cuicul (Djemila), Sitifis (Setif),
and a site whose name is only partially preserved as Mopth... (at Mons
between the first two).<b><a href="#N_59_">[[59]]</a></b>
</p><p>In the other direction, along the fringe of Tripolitania the Flavians
may have constructed auxiliary forts to watch over the Nygbenii, one of
the Gaetulian tribes, near the Chott Djerid.<b><a href="#N_60_">[[60]]</a></b>
By roughly 100 a line of forts and a military road extended from Tacapae
to Auzia, over 400 miles.
</p><center>
<p><b>Tripolitania</b></p></center>

<p>Little is known of military dispositions in this long tail of Proconsularis
which projected roughly 600 miles eastward to Cyrenaica, and the reason
is apparently that there is little to know. Only the immediate hinterland
of Lepcis Magna and Oea receives enough average annual rainfall to make
possible the cultivation of cereals with dry-farming techniques, but a
much larger area is suitable for olive orchards. The production of huge
quantities of olive oil was the basis of Tripolitania's wealth, which grew
steadily from <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus'</a></b> reign onward. After
the conclusion of the war with Tacfarinas in A.D. 24 the frontier was relatively
quiet until nearly the end of the second century. There may have been a
<i>vexillatio</i>
of <i>III Augusta</i> at an as-yet-undiscovered fort in Tripolitania for
a few years.
<i>Legio IX Hispana</i>, sent to protect Tripolitania from
Tacfarinas' attacks in A.D. 20, returned to its base at Siscia (Sisak)
in the middle Sava valley of Pannonia in 24. Valerius Festus, the perhaps
shifty legate of the Third who had secured Africa for
<b><a href="vespasia.html">Vespasian</a></b>,
drove the Garamantes and Nasamones away from Lepcis in 70.<b><a href="#N_61_">[[61]]</a></b>
Another campaign in the 80s abolished the power of the Garamantes and brought
over a hundred years of peace.
</p><p>There is strikingly little archaeological evidence for forts and linear
barriers, here called <i>clausurae,</i> but serving the same purpose as
the Numidian <i>fossatum</i>. Recall the shifts in the headquarters of
<i>legio
III Augusta</i>: from Ammaedara to Theveste in the mid-70s and 44 years
later to Lambaesis. In other words, the legion withdrew any detachments
that may have been there from Tripolitania and moved its base westward,
away from the region. The reason is obvious: the legates must have judged
that Tripolitania did not require any legionary troops. We can also assume
that any transfers of the legion came with the consent of the emperor,
who with the exception of <b><a href="nerva.html">Nerva</a></b> (96-98)
were all men with much military experience.
</p><center>
<p><b>The Reign of Trajan</b></p></center>

<p><b><a href="trajan.html">M. Ulpius Traianus</a></b> became emperor in
January, 98 and governed for almost 20 years. His policies and achievements
in Africa are a continuation of those of his Flavian predecessors. Indeed,
he almost completed them, and his successor <b><a href="hadrian.html">Hadrian</a></b>
had little more to do than tie up the loose ends and smooth off the rough
edges in his two decades as emperor. These emperors were almost a single
dynasty anyway. <b><a href="trajan.html">Trajan's</a></b> father had been
one of <b><a href="vespasia.html">Vespasian's</a></b> trusted generals and
administrators; Trajan's mother Marcia was sister of the Marcia Furnilla
who was briefly the wife of <b><a href="vespasia.html">Vespasian's
</a></b>son
<b><a href="titus.html">Titus</a></b>.
The elder Trajan's sister Ulpia was the paternal grandmother of <b><a href="hadrian.html">Hadrian</a></b>,
and
<b><a href="hadrian.html">Hadrian's</a></b> wife <b><a href="hadrian.htm#vs">Sabina</a></b>
was the maternal granddaughter of<b><a href="trajan.html"> Trajan's</a></b>
sister Ulpia Marciana. All of which is to say that <b><a href="trajan.html">Trajan</a></b>
and <b><a href="hadrian.html">Hadrian</a></b> were cousins-once-removed
by blood and <b><a href="trajan.html">Trajan's</a></b> great-niece was <b><a href="hadrian.html">Hadrian's</a></b>
empress.
</p><p>This may well be confusing to moderns, but it is neither trivial nor
unimportant. In the year 100 <b><a href="trajan.html">Trajan</a></b> had
the legate of the Third Augusta, L. Munatius Gallus, found a colony at
Thamugadi (Timgad). The town's full name, Colonia Marciana Traiana Thamugadi,
commemorates the new emperor's parents and recalls their ties to <b><a href="vespasia.html">Vespasian's</a></b>
family; its location demonstrates his commitment to continue Flavian policies
in Africa. (See Maps 4 and <a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;watdoc2map6.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=900&quot;)">6</a>.)
The colony is sited almost at the end of the road and line of forts from
the legionary headquarters at Theveste west along the northern edge of
the Aurès to Lambaesis.<b><a href="#N_62_">[[62]]</a></b> At the
time of the foundation, the colony was relatively exposed, so the government
must have judged the natives reconciled to Roman rule. Lands to the north
soon became a center for the cultivation of wheat and olives. The natives
had already developed dry-farming techniques; the Roman contribution was
to provide a monetary economy, markets, and protection from migrating and
sometimes marauding nomads from farther south.<b><a href="#N_63_">[[63]]</a></b>
The Aurès to the south were sparsely populated. Troops at Mascula
some 35 miles to the east and Lambaesis about 12 miles to the west provided
whatever protection was needed for the colony's first years. Thamugadi
is a strategic site, and it stands at the head of the Oueds el-Abdi and
el-Abiod, but there is no proof that a fort preceded the colony.<b><a href="#N_64_">[[64]]</a></b>
</p><p>During <b><a href="trajan.html">Trajan's</a></b> reign and quite likely
in stages spread out over a number of years rather than in a single move,
<i>legio
III Augusta</i> acquired a new fortress at Lambaesis. The precise date
is not known and many experts are content to say that the transfer may
not have been completed until early in the reign of <b><a href="hadrian.html">Hadrian</a></b>,
say by 120.<b><a href="#N_65_">[[65]]</a></b> This transfer advanced the
legion's headquarters about 100 miles due west from its previous fortress
at Theveste, and the implications for the frontier are noteworthy.
</p><p>For one, the legion was henceforth much farther from Tripolitania than
previously, so no significant threats were expected from that quarter.
For another, the legion was now much closer to the permanently troublesome
peoples of the Hodna and Atlas mountains of Mauretania. It anchored protection
for the entrepreneurial native farmers and the growing number of Roman
towns, especially the colonies at Thamugadi a few miles to the east, at
Cuicul, Mopth... and Sitifis roughly 70 to 80 miles to the northwest, and
Cirta 60 to 65 miles to the north.<b><a href="#N_66_">[[66]]</a></b> Third,
Lambaesis, backing up on Djebel Askar ("Mountain of the Soldiers") at the
northwest corner of the Aurès and at an altitude of about 4000 feet,
guarded the head of the El Kantara pass which led to the semi-desert lands
south of the mountains. This was the most important of the routes through
the Aurès. As appears in Part 5, Hadrian took additional steps to
regulate traffic in and along these passes. Fourth, the legionary legate
at Lambaesis was now roughly 300 miles from the proconsul at Carthage,
so the move greatly increased his operational independence from his nominal
superior and speeded up the evolution of "Numidia" into a province.
</p><p>The career of L. Minicius Natalis, one of the better-recorded legates
of<i> III Augusta,</i> provides further indications that <b><a href="trajan.html">Trajan
</a></b>continued
the Flavian advance. Inscriptions prove that in 103-105 he initiated Roman
control along the southern side of the Aurès range and its extensions
toward the Gulf of Gabès. Natalis built a fort at Ad Maiores and
a road from Ad Medias by Capsa on to Turris Temellini on the Chott Djerid.
Another assemblage of inscriptions manifests his activity in defining boundaries
in the area from Theveste to Madaurus between the Musulamii and (a) the
people of Madaurus, (b) another tribe, the Tisibenenses, and c) a private
owner Valeria Atticilla.<b><a href="#N_67_">[[67]]</a></b>
</p><p>As <b><a href="vespasia.html">Vespasian </a></b>had founded a colony
at Ammaedara when he moved the legion to Theveste ca. 75, so <b><a href="trajan.html">Trajan</a></b>
founded a <i>colonia</i> in the decommissioned fortress at Theveste forty
years later. The foundation date cannot be more closely determined than
the reign of <b><a href="trajan.html">Trajan,</a></b> but this permits us
to make a point of some relevance for the date of Lambaesis. The legion
must have fully evacuated Theveste before the colonists moved in. Unless
we envision the HQ staff and etc. at one or more intermediate stops along
the road west, this should mean that the Third Augusta was entirely in
its new home by the end of <b><a href="trajam.html">Trajan's</a></b> reign
in 117. <b><a href="trajan.html">Trajan</a></b> founded a third colony at
Thelepte (Feriana) on the old road from Ammaedara through Capsa (Gafsa)
to Tacapae.<b><a href="#N_68_">[[68]]</a></b> <b><a href="trajan.html">Trajan's</a></b>
titular colonies were all in the older part of the province: Lepcis Magna,
Lepti Minus, Hadrumetum, Milev, Chullu and Rusicade.

<p>As already noted, <i>Legio III Augusta</i> was based at its fortress
of Lambaesis by early in the reign of<b><a href="hadrian.html"> Hadrian</a></b>
if it had not moved late in that of <b><a href="trajan.html">Trajan</a></b>.
The colony of Thamugadi was founded in 100, far to the west of Theveste
but just 12 miles east of Lambaesis. That is to say, since the colony will
not have been ahead of protection from the army, at least several cohorts
must have been at Lambaesis, perhaps serving as the fortress construction
party, by 100. Simultaneously, one or more cohorts may have occupied an
intermediate fort along the road from Theveste for a few years, say at
Mascula also close enough at 35 to 37 miles to help protect the colony.
Perhaps we should envision a shift from the old fortress in stages, beginning
with the detachment which occupied the small fort near the later fortress
in 81 and concluding with the transfer of headquarters staff and administrative
records by, say, 120. The fortress could house the entire legion (although
one cohort was regularly detached for ceremonial and other duties with
the proconsul in Carthage) before <b><a href="hadrian.html">Hadrian</a></b>
visited Lambaesis in 128.
</p><p><b><a href="hadrian.html">Hadrian</a></b> in 128 was the first reigning
emperor to visit Africa, and this makes a fitting stopping place for our
survey of the development of the frontier. The next emperor who toured
Africa was <b><a href="sepsev.html">Septimius Severus</a></b> in 203, and
his family was from Lepcis Magna. <b><a href="hadrian.html">Hadrian's
</a></b>journey
through the province was momentous and long remembered. Tradition held
that his arrival broke a five-year drought. More relevant to our purposes,
he completed a series of modifications in the frontier zone that had been
underway since <b><a href="vespasia.html">Vespasian's</a></b> day.<b><a href="#N_69_">[[69]]</a></b>
</p><p>The emperor rewarded and encouraged urbanization: five towns were promoted
to titular colonies and at least ten were upgraded to <i>municipia</i>.
His attitude toward the army was similar. In late June and early July he
toured some of the forts in Numidia and made a celebrated stopover at Lambaesis.
In the company of the legionary legate Q. Fabius Catullinus (who became
consul in 130) and presumably seated under an awning on a temporary tribunal,
<b><a href="hadrian.html">Hadrian</a></b>
watched various units perform maneuvers on the exercise ground (<i>campus</i>)
a mile and a half from the fortress. When they had completed their <i>exercitationes</i>
he complimented them on their skills. The speeches fall into the tradition
of imperial addresses to the soldiers: the <i>adlocutio</i> of the emperor
to his fellow soldiers (<i>commilitones</i>), vital in building and maintaining
the loyalty of the army to the reigning Augustus.<b><a href="#N_70_">[[70]]</a></b>
Five speeches survive, albeit incomplete: to the senior centurions (<i>primipilares</i>),
legionary cavalry, and auxiliary units; unfortunately that to the legionaries
is lost. In commemoration of the imperial visit similar to that of an <i>adventus</i>
to towns, the temporary tribunal was monumentalized by paving over the
central part of the <i>campus</i>, erecting a column, and inscribing the
<i>adlocutiones</i>

the addresses validated them for all eternity; how many people ever read
them mattered little.<b><a href="#N_72_">[[72]]</a></b>
</p><p>The other aspect of <b><a href="hadrian.html">Hadrian's</a></b> tour
to be emphasized here is that, as a few years earlier in Germany and Britain,
he personally supervised the initial construction of what is conventionally
called the <i>fossatum</i> or, less frequently, <i>limes</i>. (What the
Romans called it is not known.) See <a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;wardoc6map6.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=900&quot;)">Map
6</a>. So far as is known, this was four stretches of patrol road, ditch,
wall, towers, and gates designed to monitor and regulate the migrations
of the semi-nomadic peoples between their summer and winter pastures. As
the map reveals, the sections of the <i>fossatum</i> were separate; varying
in length from 28 to 90 miles, they were never linked to form a continuous
barrier. In other words, the <i>fossatum</i> was intended neither to protect
settled farmers inside the empire from raids by outsiders nor to provide
unbroken surveillance over the countryside. It was clearly not heavily
garrisoned in the fashion of <b><a href="hadrian.html">Hadrian's</a></b>
famous wall in Britain or the less impressive palisade with frontal ditch
and watchtowers along the Main and Neckar rivers and Taunus mountains in
Germany.<b><a href="#N_73_">[[73]]</a></b>
</p><p><b><a href="hadrian.html">Hadrian's</a></b> achievement, then, was to
carry through into a coherent system what <b><a href="trajan.html">Trajan</a></b>
may have projected. As <b><a href="trajan.html">Trajan</a></b> completed
the implications of Flavian policies by advancing the legionary fortress
to Lambaesis (though perhaps the process was not complete until the first
years of <b><a href="hadrian.html">Hadrian</a></b>) and guaranteeing control
along the north side of the Aurès, and then went beyond that of
the Flavians by staking out a few isolated posts to the south, so now <b><a href="hadrian.html">Hadrian
</a></b>completed
the encirclement of the Aurès and the eastern Hodna. <b><a href="trajan.html">Trajan</a></b>
had put a fort at Ad Maiores in 105. Hadrian answered with Gemellae (Mlila)
in 126<b><a href="#N_74_">[[74]]</a></b> and in all probability several
other forts plus numerous towers and small forts (analogous to the "milecastles"
on the wall in Britain). By the 130s the disposition of auxiliaries was
likely something like this: along the north slope of the Aurès at
Zoui, <i>ala I Flaviana Numidica</i>,at Mascula two cohorts, <i>VII Lusitanorum
equitata</i> and <i>II Thracum</i>, and another cohort at Zaraia, <i>I
Flaviana</i>; along the southern slope of the Aurès at Lambiridi
a few miles west of Lambaesis, <i>cohors VI Commagenorum</i> and <i>ala
I Pannoniorum</i>, and at Calceus Herculis (El Kantara) perhaps the <i>numerus
Palmyrenorum</i>. Vescera (Biskra) and Calceus Herculis controlled the
southern ends of the long passes through the Aurès: the Oued el-Abiod
and the El Kantara gap between the Metlili and Belezma mountains to the
west and the Mahmel to the east, (the route of Algerian highway 3.) Though
garrisons are unattested as early as the 130s, Thabudeos (Tobarta), Thubunae
(Tobna),and Cellae (Ain Azel) may have been occupied on occasion. Each
segment of the <i>fossatum</i> screened patches of fertile ground around
oases along routes of migration.

<p><b><u>6. Summary.</u></b></p></center>

<p>Africa was never of major concern in Roman military thought, never one
of the senior commands that is to say, not a consular multi-legion post
like Syria, Upper Moesia or Britain. Until well beyond the reign of <b><a href="hadrian.html">Hadrian</a></b>,
and thus all through the period covered by this article, it was unique.
As we have seen, in the Empire Africa began as a senatorial province in
which the governor was of consular rank but yet had command of a legion
plus whatever auxiliary troops were at hand. While all senatorial governors
by courtesy were styled "proconsuls", none of them had command of a legion;
the only other senatorial province whose governor was of consular standing
was Asia, and its governor seems to have had no troops at all beyond perhaps
a honor guard for basic escort duties. For good reason, then, only Africa
was designated Proconsularis. In one sense, however, the uniqueness was
lost early. When <b><a href="gaius.html">Caligula</a></b> removed the proconsul
from command of <i>legio III Augusta</i> and entrusted the legion to an
imperial appointee of praetorian standing, he made the legionary legate
a provincial governor in all but name. Numidia remained technically a part
of Proconsularis and the legate theoretically subordinate to the proconsul
in civil but not military matters. In practice, the legate probably regularly
rendered judicial decisions and the proconsul did not intervene. This anomaly
remained in effect through <b><a href="hadrian.html">Hadrian's
</a></b>reign
and until<b><a href="sepsev.html"> Septimius Severus</a></b> abolished it
in the first years of the third century.
</p><p>As Cherry has aptly characterized it, the conquest of Africa "proceeded
intermittently, in fits and starts" from 146 B.C. and "was in fact largely
complete (at least from the Roman point of view) before the death of<b><a href="hadrian.html">
Hadrian</a></b>" in 138 A.D.<b><a href="#N_75_">([[75]]</a></b> We traced
this process in the preceding pages and divided it into four stages for
convenience.
<b>(1)</b> A century of relative indifference and neglect,
ending when Julius Caesar annexed Numidia, formed a second African province
(Nova) to the west of the original one (Vetus), and refounded Carthage,
in 46-44 B.C. <b>(2)</b> Slightly more than a century, the reigns of <b><a href="auggie.html">Augustus</a></b>
and his Julio-Claudian successors, to A.D. 68. In these years Africa received
a permanent legion (<i>III Augusta</i>) and an uncertain number of auxiliary
units, and the legion, at first apparently spread out in two (perhaps three)
vexillations, came to be entirely housed at Ammaedara. Roads joined Ammaedara
to both Carthage and Tacapae. In the early 40s the Mauretanian client kingdom
was annexed and became the two equestrian procuratorial provinces of Caesariensis
(capital, Iol Caesarea) and Tingitana (capital, Tingi).
</p><p><b>(3)</b> The time of the Flavians and <b><a href="trajan.html">Trajan</a></b>,
A.D. 69-117. In these years, Rome pushed the frontier southwestward to
and then along the northern flank of the Aurès mountains. The fortress
of <i>III Augusta</i> shifted a few miles to Theveste and auxiliary units
(or legionary <i>vexillationes</i>) established forts as construction crews
extended the road on to the west. <b><a href="trajan.html">Trajan
</a></b>initiated
control along the southern flank of the Aurès with a road from Turris
Tamellini to ad Medias and a fort at ad Maiores. When the military had
pulled out of its camps <b><a href="trajan.html">Trajan
</a></b>founded
colonies on the decommissioned sites and elsewhere to consolidate Roman
possession and encourage development, notably at Thamugadi in 100 but also
at Theveste and Thelepte. By late in <b><a href="trajan.html">Trajan's</a></b>
reign a new fortress was being built at Lambaesis. And <b>(4)</b>, the
reign of <b><a href="hadrian.html">Hadrian</a></b>, which ended in 138.
By the time <b><a href="hadrian.html">Hadrian</a></b> visited Africa in
128 the fortress was finished. He seems to have continued
<b><a href="trajan.html">Trajan's</a></b>
policy of road plus forts along the southern slopes of the Aurès
and himself to have devised the so-called <i>fossatum</i>, designed to
regulate the seasonal migrations of the semi-nomadic peoples of the semi-desert
Sahara. The post-Hadrianic period saw relatively minor adjustments to the
frontier and a complex rearrangement of the garrison's various units, but
these alterations fall outside the period of this study.
</p><p>Only in the East, where the Roman Empire butted up against that of the
Parthians, can one speak of a sharp, distinct border. Elsewhere the frontiers
were zones, susceptible to expansion and even contraction and where Roman
control and lifestyle gradually faded out in contact with shifting tribal
kingdoms and confederations. Even where the Romans established a formal,
symbolic barrier proclaiming 'This marks the end of our empire: civilization
stops here!,' most famously Hadrian's Wall in Britain, Roman power and
influence extended beyond that marker. Patrols ranged well past the barriers,
and there were certainly traders and spies gathering and transmitting information.<b><a href="#N_76_">[[76]]</a></b>
</p><p>Africa illustrates this very well. All along the southern reaches of
Cyrenaica, Tripolitania, Proconsularis, Numidia, and the two Mauretanias,
there was no sharp delineation of the Roman world. A very small military
force maintained relative peace through this immense region. To the south
of the lands claimed by Rome lay the lightly populated pre-desert and then
the wastes of the Sahara. In overview, here is the situation at the end
of <b><a href="hadrian.html">Hadrian's</a></b> reign: The eastern sector,
Tripolitania, was practically undefended: two auxiliary cohorts for upwards
of 700 miles from Cyrenaica westward to Tacape.<b><a href="#N_77_">[[77]]</a></b>
The western sector, the two Mauretanias, was more troublesome and hence
more strongly defended, but Rome never tried to push far inland beyond
the coastal plains and never truly ruled the Atlas ranges.<b><a href="#N_78_">[[78]]</a></b>
</p><p>Most of the African army was stationed in the central sector, Numidia.
With the exception of the few soldiers under the proconsul at Carthage
(one legionary cohort on rotation, and the 13<sup>th</sup> Urban Cohort),
all units were under the command of the <i>legatus Augusti pro praetore
legionis III Augustae</i>.<b><a href="#N_79_">[[79]]</a></b> The Roman
military establishment in Africa was remarkably small, "designed more for
police than for war."<b><a href="#N_80_">[[80]]</a></b> The one legion
in all Africa west of Egypt was at Lambaesis, and if at full strength it
had about 5500 men. Individual legionary cohorts or smaller detachments
may have been outposted from time to time, but auxiliary units were mostly
responsible for the security of this large area. There is much uncertainty
as to how many of them were in Africa at any one time and whether any were
double-strength (<i>milliaria</i>). As best as can be calculated, there
were 3 cavalry <i>alae</i>, 4 or 5 part-mounted <i>cohortes equitatae</i>,
and one or two infantry cohorts, and perhaps the <i>numerus Palmyrenorum.</i><b><a href="#N_81_">[[81]]</a></b>
In effect, the road from Tacapae through Turris Tamellini, Capsa, ad Maiores,
ad Medias, Thabudeos, Vescera and Gemellae south of the Aurès massif
was the southernmost fringe of the Roman Empire. In Tripolitania the lightly
settled inhospitable uplands behind the three great cities held no attraction
for the Romans and in <b><a href="hadrian.html">Hadrian's</a></b> day there
was evidently no real garrison here. And in the Mauretanias a rather large
auxiliary garrison held the coastal plains and Rome mostly avoided the
Atlas mountains.

<p><b>WEBLIOGRAPHY</b></p></center>

<p>There are web sites for several of the places mentioned in the text,
and of course the web is constantly expanding so what follows is obviously
intended only as a few suggestions which the author found useful at one
time. Some are only in French, others provide English translations. I did
not bother to list promotionals put out by tour companies and tourists'
travelogues unless I found them (notably the photos) particularly good.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p><u>Legio III Augusta</u>: Countless websites are devoted to various
aspects of the Roman army and several provide basic historical data about
all of the legions. Their content is often unreliable and cursory, and
they often repeat one another. Two sites are listed below with illustrations
of the types of error one encounters. The monographs by Y. LeBohec listed
above are irreplaceable for serious work.
</p><p><a href="https://www.livius.org/le-lh/legio/iii_augusta.html">https://www.livius.org/le-lh/legio/iii_augusta.html</a>
Some serious errors are (1) that the legion was based at Theveste before
moving to Ammaedara during the revolt of Tacfarinas the transfer from Ammaedara
to Theveste is given correctly later in the narrative; (2) that III Augusta
was the only legion commanded by a senator, a situation which changed under
Caligula when the proconsular governor lost command of the legion the error
is the failure to realize that while the proconsuls no longer controlled
the legion, the legionary legates were senators of praetorian standing,
although appointed by the emperor; (3) the historian Velleius Paterculus
may have commanded III Augusta.
</p><p><a href="https://members.tripod.com/~HAuburn/LegIII.html">https://members.tripod.com/~HAuburn/LegIII.html</a>
Two notable errors are (1) that III Augusta was at Lambaesis from "+75"
(i.e., 75 A.D.) there was evidently a unit of troops in a small fort not
far from the fortress from 81, but the entire legion was not in its fortress
here until 115-120; (2) two commanders' names are consistently misspelled,
P. Cornelius Dolabella (not Donabella), who defeated Tacfarinas; and Pescennius
Niger (not Prescennius).

excavations and the holdings of the museums in Tunis, particularly the

of a military nature.
</p><p><u>Lambaesis</u>: Several sites provided under the adjacent town, Tazoult,
provided interesting information on the uprisings and revolts at the high
security prison (especially in 1994) that lies overtop the Roman legionary
fortress. <a href="https://lambaesis.ignaut.net/">https://lambaesis.ignaut.net</a>

<p><a name="N_1_"></a>[[1]]Two points about the citation used in this article.
First, ancient forms of place names are used throughout, both in the text
and on the maps. The first time a place appears, the modern form follows
in parentheses; thereafter, only the ancient form is given. If the modern
name is simply an adaptation of the ancient one (as Lambèse from
Lambaesis), I use only the Roman form. Second, the notes refer to the scholarly
literature in a short form; full information is in the Bibliography. <i>MRR</i>

1951/52; 2 vols.; vol. 3 with additions and corrections, 1986).
</p><p><a name="N_2_"></a>[[2]]See Février (1989-90) pp. 75-80 on the
epigraphic evidence. He estimates 250,000 inscriptions across the Maghreb
and
Tripolitania, but stresses that these quarter-million texts are very uneven
in place, time and subject.
</p><p><a name="N_3_"></a>[[3]] Experts disagree as to the strength of the
Roman military establishment in Africa. We do not know the precise figures
for the auxiliary units, and sometimes it is not clear whether an author
is incorporating the garrison of Tripolitania and Cyrenaica into the figures
for Proconsularis and the two Mauretanias.
</p><p><a name="N_4_"></a>[[4]]Modern writers increasingly stress this theme,
and we will return to it in Parts 4 and 5. For an example, see Daniels
(1987) pp. 233-35. "The relationship between the two ways of life was complex
and at the same time both hostile and symbiotic, for the pastoralists needed
the farmers with whom they could exchange animal produce in return for
grain, and the farmers needed the sources of extra harvest labour which
the nomads provided." Many nomads practiced some agriculture along with
seasonal transhumance.
</p><p><a name="N_5_"></a>[[5]] More correctly, perhaps, one should speak of
the
<u>known</u> fortresses of <i>III Augusta</i>. There was no permanent
provincial garrison in the Republic, and thus no permanent camp; and in
the early Empire legions may have been divided in half and stationed in
two camps for a few years, perhaps moving from time to time. As appears
below, the first certain camp of the Third is at Ammaedara, but as the
known area seems too small to have housed more than half of the legion,
the rest of it had an as-yet-undiscovered base or bases. From the A.D.
40s onward the commander of the legion was practically the governor of
Numidia, a situation which received official recognition when Numidia was
made a province distinct from Proconsularis about 208. See Part 3, below.
</p><p><a name="N_6_"></a>[[6]]Technically, Tripolitania was part of <i>provincia
Africa</i> from 46 B.C., though the governors at Carthage seem not to have
paid much attention to it; it eventually became a separate province. The
two Mauretanias, Caesariensis and Tingitana, were annexed in A.D. 43/44:
covered briefly in Part 3, below.

Carthage had to cede to Masinissa all lands he or his ancestors had claimed

Roller (2003) pp. 12-17; Raven (1993) pp. 31f., 41-45. The account of Livy
is far more exciting reading than the dry analysis of Polybius: Livy 28.12-16,
35; 29.29-33; 30.3-15 (including presentation of the <i>scipio</i>), 32-35,

</p><p><a name="N_13_"></a>[[13]] Appian's <i>Punica</i> (or <i>Libyca</i>)
is the only surviving narrative of the fighting and the settlement. The
widespread tale that Romans sowed salt over the site of the destroyed city
is to be rejected: Ridley (1986). Ridley is wrong in saying "Appian is
careful, however, to specify that the ground was not cursed." <i>Pun</i>.
136 ends by stating that Caesar and Octavian refounded Carthage but used
land adjacent to the former site "being careful to avoid [or guarding against]
the curse of long ago." (<i>phylaxamenos tes palai to eparaton</i>). The
last word is related to <i>eparomai</i>, to curse; and <i>epara</i>, a
solemn curse.
</p><p><a name="N_14_"></a>[[14]]Appian, <i>Pun.</i> 94, 105-106, 132-136;
he mentions the senatorial commission which assisted Scipio in creating
the province. See Daniels (1987) pp. 236-238, little changed from Broughton

</p><p><a name="N_24_"></a>[[24]] The literature on Carthage is vast; all histories
of Roman Africa discuss Caesar's work. Poinssot (1962) and Broughton (1969/70)
are particularly relevant here. Carthage's <i>tribus</i>, the Arnensis,
is found widely in Vetus and the vast colonial <i>pertica</i> enjoyed immunity
from taxation. As appears in Part 3 of this article, Caesar's new province
was amalgamated with the old one in a few years and his colony was reinforced
or refounded about 29 B.C. See Fishwick (1993) and esp. (1994).
</p><p><a name="N_25_"></a>[[25]]A good narrative is that by Romanelli (1959)
pp. 140-150. Raven (1993) is more compressed. See App., <i>BC</i> 4.36
and 53; Dio 48.1.3, 17, 21; <i>ILS</i> 1945 is the career of one M. Caelius
Phileros, who described himself as <i>accensus T. Sextii imperatoris</i>.
Unless Phileros used the term <i>imperator</i> very loosely ("commander,
governor"), the meaning should be that Sextius won it in the campaign against
Cornificius or possibly against Fango, on which see below. Phileros' career
is very important for an understanding of the colony of Carthage, but has
little to do with the frontier.
</p><p><a name="N_26_"></a>[[26]]App.,<i> BC</i> 5.26; Dio 48.22.
</p><p><a name="N_27_"></a>[[27]]App., <i>BC</i> 5.53, 65, 75; Dio 48.20.4,
23.45, and 28.4. See Fishwick (1994), at pp. 58-64. The <i>violenta ludibria</i>
ascribed to Lepidus by Tertullian (<i>de Pallio</i> 1.2) were the demolition
of buildings which had encroached on the cursed old city around the Byrsa
and Megara. Caesar in 44 (as well as Octavian at his refoundation in 29)
carefully located the colony off the cursed land, but "developers" had
evidently spilled over.
</p><p><a name="N_28_"></a>[[28]]I accept the arguments of Fishwick's three
studies: (1993, 1994 and 1996).
</p><p><a name="N_29_"></a>[[29]]Daniels (1987) pp. 237f. accepts 27. Romanelli
(1959) pp. 153-160 hedges by arguing that the two provinces were in effect
one from 36 but were not formally united until 27.
</p><p><a name="N_30_"></a>[[30]]The <i>acta triumphalia</i> are conveniently
printed in E-J; <i>MRR</i> 2. 413 and 419 for Taurus and Cornificius. Whether
the two Cornificii were related is unknown: the earlier's filiation is
not on record but the later was son of a Lucius; possibly cousins, as the
<i>nomen</i>
is fairly unusual. L. Sempronius Atratinus triumphed in 21 and L. Cornelius
Balbus in 19, both also <i>ex Africa</i>. Balbus' campaign was famous as
he fought the Garamantes south of Tripolitania: Pliny, <i>NH</i> 5.36;
cf. Mattingly (1994), pp. 18, 30, 35, 41, 43, 51, 70 and 74. <i>Res Gestae</i>
25 for Africa and note the plurals <i>Hispaniae</i> and<i> Galliae</i>
for those provinces. Strabo 17.3.25 describes the distribution of provinces
in 27 with "Libya" (=Africa) going to the people; but this means only that
a single province was in existence by 27, not that two became one in that
year. Dio 53.12.48 describes a distinction between Africa and Numidia because
they were separate when he wrote, ca. 220 A.D. Severus divided them ca.
203. See Birley (1988) p. 114. In his 1994 article Fishwick shows that
the career of Phileros should be dated to the years when Lepidus governed
the consolidated province (pp. 64ff.).
</p><p><a name="N_31_"></a>[[31]] For the colonies, see Mackie (1983). She
revives an old argument based on Dio 49.43.7 that Octavian briefly annexed
Mauretania as a province, founded the colonies, and in 25 converted the
province into a client kingdom: Romanelli rejected the case (1959), pp.
156f.; and it is not very likely. On the other hand, Octavian may have
done roughly the same thing by annexing the kingdom of the Nabataeans in
31 B.C.: see G. Bowersock, <i>Roman Arabia</i> (Cambridge, MA., 1983),
pp. 50-58; the parallel is not exact, since Aretas IV was on the throne
from 9/8 and there were no colonies in Arabia. M. Sartre tentatively accepts
Bowersock's hypothesis:
<i>The Middle East under Rome</i> (Cambridge, MA,
2005; trans. C. Porter and E. Rawlings), pp. 72f., 82f. I rather doubt
that the 12 colonies were administratively attached to Baetica in southern
Spain, as Mackie has it (pp. 350-357). For Bocchus, Bogud and Juba, see
Roller (2003) pp. 49-58, 91-100; cf. Romanelli (1959) pp. 162, 168-173,
188; Dio 49.43.7. Bogud abandoned his kingdom in 38 but was killed while
serving with Antony in 31; Bocchus died in 33 and left his kingdom to Octavian.

L. Nonius Asprenas (cos. suff. A.D. 6) was proconsul in 12/13-15/16. "CI..."
is the mileage, the precise figure being unknown. Daniels (1987)&nbsp;
p. 238 doubts that the HQ of <i>III Augusta</i> were at Ammaedara until
early in the reign of Tiberius (14-37): he says that Tacitus notes that
the legion wintered in the old province until 22-23 and Ammaedara was outside
Vetus. "Perhaps the fortress had been planned, but at Augustus' death the
idea was dropped by Tiberius." I reject this for reasons that appear in
the text. Cagnat (1913) p. 429 (cf. 582) followed Mommsen (<i>CIL</i> 8
p. xxi) in believing that the legion's first fortress was Theveste. Discoveries
at Ammaedara soon disproved the hypothesis: cf. already in 1929 Broughton,
pp. 92, 97; and LeBohec, <i>Leg. III</i>, pp. 341ff.
</p><p><a name="N_34_"></a>[[34]] Mackensen (1995) has shown beyond doubt that
at least a part of the legion was at Ammaedara before the death of Augustus.
There was room for five or six cohorts plus some auxiliary cavalry. The
great road from Carthage became the camp's <i>via principalis</i> and the
<i>via
praetoria</i> exits the camp, crosses the Oued Haidra on an existing Roman
bridge, and makes its way to Tacapae; it is the road under construction
in 14. See his maps pp. 327, 331.
</p><p><a name="N_35_"></a>[[35]] Mattingly (1994) p. 79. LeBohec, <i>Leg.
III</i> pp. 340ff., 353ff: roads converge on Sicca; small forts are known
near Vaga (Beja) and near Simitthu (Chemtou), but it is not certain that
they are to be dated to this period.

the prosperity of the kingdom was too tempting for Rome to resist; Ptolemy
was "summoned to Rome and executed" in 40; the provinces were formed early
in 43. Barrett erroneously refers to the legion as II, and on pp 121-123
the title of Appendix 2 should be "Proconsuls" not "Procurators of Africa

reign is lost. Barrett says Ptolemy's involvement in the conspiracy is
unknowable now but Caligula used it as an excuse and executed the king
on returning to Rome in the summer of 40. Fishwick argues that Caligula
summoned him to Rome in 38 but then went to Lugdunum (Lyon) over the winter
of 39/40, had the king brought there and executed in the spring of 40.
Roller agrees that Ptolemy was insufficiently subordinate and prefers an
execution in Rome in late 40.

his sons Titus, 79-81 and Domitian, 81-96; Nerva, 96-98; and Nerva's adopted
son Trajan, 98-117. Nerva only lasted 16 months, from September 96 to January
98, too short a reign to implement his own policies. He claimed credit
for two colonies, but was probably carrying out plans projected by the
Flavians.

is sound (1959, pp. 279-285), but his account of events thereafter is now

Mattingly is thorough for Tripolitania (1994, pp. 70-72, 77, 80). Cherry

veterans retired from the legion annually and most of them did not become
farmers; nor were there extensive imperial estates (<i>saltus</i>) here.
Natives owned the multitude of small farms. Roman governors marked off
native lands in a process called <i>limitatio</i> (the establishing of
boundaries, <i>limites</i>), not to confine the natives to the poorer lands
but to supervise them and (we may suspect) demonstrate that the Romans
would not encroach further.

excluding the Mauretanias; Levick (1990) says 19 auxiliary units in the
Mauretanias, which would be roughly 9120, and if we add this to LeBohec's
11,260 we have a total of 20,380. Cherry (1998) p. 53: 20,000 auxiliaries

chaps. 15. His chart on p. 165 shows 2 <i>alae</i>, 4 or 5 <i>cohortes
equitatae</i>, and one purely infantry <i>cohors</i> at the end of the
first century, or roughly 3360 auxiliaries; the figures increased over
the second century to 3 <i>alae</i>, 6 <i>cohortes equitatae</i>, 2 <i>cohortes</i>
and the <i>numerus Palmyrenorum</i>, a total of roughly 5760.
