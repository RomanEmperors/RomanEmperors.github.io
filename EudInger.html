<p>Eudocia Ingerina ('daughter of Inger'), arguably the central player
in the establishment of the Macedonian dynasty, was the wife of <b><a href="basili.html">Basil
I</a></b> (867-886), the first of this line. She was thus the mother of
the two successive emperors, <b><a href="leovi.html">Leo VI</a></b> (886-912)
and <b><a href="alexanderi.html">Alexander</a></b> (912-913) and grandmother
of the renowned <b><a href="connieviip.html">Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus</a></b>(913-959).
The dynasty which she founded, perhaps the most glorious in Byzantine history,
was to rule the empire until the death of Eudocia's great-great-great granddaughter,
the 'purple-born' nun Theodora, in 1056.
</p><p>What is, of course, down-played in historical sources of the Macedonian
dynasty is that this 'well-branched vine bearing the grapes of the Empire',<b><a href="#N_1_">[[1]]</a></b>
in order to achieve the accession of her new husband <b><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></b>,
had been an active accomplice in the murder of her long-time lover, the
twenty-seven year old <b><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael III</a></b> (842-867),
whom <b><a href="basili.html">Basil </a></b>then supplanted.
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times">Eudocia and Michael III</span></b></p></center>

<p><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael
III 'the Amorian'</a></span></b><span face="Times">, a notable playboy
emperor, had been born on 19 January 840.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_2_">[[2]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
As the only surviving son of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="theophilus.html">Theophilus</a></span></b><span face="Times">
(829-842) and Theodora, following five older sisters -- Thecla, Anna, Anastasia,
Maria and Pulcheria (the three oldest of whom had been crowned empresses
by their father in the absence of a son)</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_3_">[[3]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
-- </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
at his father's unexpectedly early death came to the throne when only two
years of age.</span>
</p><p><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
mother, Theodora, daughter of Marinus, a drungarius or tourmarches (high-ranking
provincial military officer), and his wife Theoctiste Phlorina,</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_4_">[[4]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
originated from Paphlagonia. On 5 June 830 she had been married to </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="theophilus.html">Theophilus</a></span></b><span face="Times">,
supposedly after a brideshow, at which </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="theophilus.html">Theophilus</a></span></b><span face="Times">
rejected the poetess Kassia.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_5_">[[5]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
She brought her family to power with her: despite certain disagreements
within the marriage (particularly over icon-veneration, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="theophilus.html">Theophilus</a></span></b><span face="Times">
being a committed iconoclast), </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="theophilus.html">Theophilus</a></span></b><span face="Times">
clearly intended Theodora to act as regent in the event of his death, but
included with her in the regency council the eunuch Theoctistus, logothete
of the dromos, and Theodora's uncle Manuel the protomagistros; her brother
Bardas, and possibly another brother Petronas, may also have been included.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_6_">[[6]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">While Theodora and Theoctistus took the opportunity
as regents to restore icon-veneration in 843 (for which both were canonised),</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_7_">[[7]]</a><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
interests as he grew up were more liberal and less conventional. Certainly
he was precocious by modern (if not by medieval) standards, and in 855,
at the age of fifteen, was devoted to hunting and chariot racing and had
already openly taken a mistress. This lady, Eudocia Ingerina, must have
been born c. 840 or earlier and so was probably slightly older than </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
(for which there are many historical parallels at the Byzantine and other
medieval courts). She was obviously of good family, perhaps a lady-in-waiting
and one of Theodora's retinue, and her father Inger may have been related
to the iconoclast bishop Inger of Nicaea, who held the see of Nicaea c.
825.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_8_">[[8]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Cyril Mango has postulated that the family was of Rus descent and Eudocia
therefore of Scandinavian origin (Inger being an approximate rendering
of Igor or Ingvarr). In this case Eudocia may well have been a fair-haired
'Scandinavian beauty'.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_9_">[[9]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
We are told by various sources that her father Inger was of good family
and she was also connected, presumably through her mother, with the Martinakioi,
who, like bishop Inger, had iconoclast leanings.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_10_">[[10]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Theophano, first wife of Eudocia's son <a href="leovi.html"><b>Leo VI</b>,</a>
also belonged to this family, being the daughter of Constantine Martinakes
and so one of Eudocia's own relations. Eudocia herself chose Theophano
as her son's wife and as her successor as empress.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_11_">[[11]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">While mistresses at court were nothing new in this
period, they were almost invariably (as far as we can judge) of good family,
involving girls at court who were there in their role as attendants of
the women of the imperial family. Significantly many of these became imperial
mistresses and ended up marrying the emperor. This was the case for Theodote,
mistress and then second wife of
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="connievi.html">Constantine
VI</a></span></b><span face="Times">; as well as for Zoe Zaoutzaina and
Zoe Karbounopsina, mistresses of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="leovi.html">Leo
VI</a></span></b><span face="Times"> and his second and fourth wives respectively.
Eudocia would also have been one of this class: a well-born, educated,
attractive and socially competent teenager with a highly respected family
background, and so of appropriate material for an imperial bride at a period
when it was usual for empresses to be chosen from within the Byzantine
elite.</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">The association between </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael
</a></span></b><span face="Times">and
Eudocia Ingerina was not at all to the liking of the pious empress Theodora,
and it is recorded that Eudocia was hated by both Theodora and her chief
minister Theoctistus because of her 'impudence' or shamelessness:</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_12_">[[12]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
this teenage starlet, who had 'entrapped' the greatest catch in the empire,
was clearly not concerned to play down her relationship with the young
emperor and made her position as imperial concubine more than obvious.
So, to counteract this infatuation as quickly as possible, in that same
year as <b><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></b> liaison became notorious,
Theodora is said to have arranged a bride-show to choose a suitable imperial
bride. The fifteen-year old emperor was married to the more suitable Eudocia
Decapolitissa, a lady of whose background we know nothing and whom </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
was to ignore for the rest of his reign. The marriage was stage-managed
through the preliminaries of a bride-show, though Eudocia Decapolitissa
was certainly of noble birth and belonged to court circles.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_13_">[[13]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
As with previous bride-shows, the potential groom had little, if no, say
in the selection and the decision was orchestrated by Theodora and Theoctistus:
Eudocia Ingerina -- as a noble girl of good family, well-known at court,
and presumably intensely good-looking (as was expected of an imperial mistress)</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_14_">[[14]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
-- was actually permitted to take part, but Michael was not allowed to
choose her.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_15_">[[15]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
The fact that she was the emperor's mistress was obviously not considered
to be an appropriate qualification and Theodora intended to see this young
rival to herself and her daughters upstaged at court.</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">This unwished-for marriage may have been one of the
contributing factors behind </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
rebellion against his mother's regency. While still fifteen years of age,
he deposed Theodora and Theoctistus, with the help of his uncle Bardas,
Theodora's brother, who was to replace them as </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
chief minister. The most shocking aspect of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
deposition of his mother was the murder of Theoctistus on 20 November 855.
In a sense history was repeating itself, for Theoctistus had earlier helped
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
grandfather, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeii.html">Michael
II</a></span></b><span face="Times">, assassinate <i>his</i> predecessor
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="leov.html">Leo
V</a></span></b><span face="Times">. Bardas did not probably intend the
murder, but </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
egged on the imperial guard to kill Theoctistus though Theodora tried to
protect her logothete as he cowered behind a chair.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_16_">[[16]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Kalomaria, Theodora's sister, and Theophanes, chief of the wardrobe, are
also said to have joined the conspiracy.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_17_">[[17]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Bardas had encouraged this revolt, by convincing </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael
</a></span></b><span face="Times">that
Theodora planned to depose him and marry Theoctistus herself (unlikely
because he was a eunuch),</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_18_">[[18]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
or marry off one of her daughters to a suitable son-in-law and make him
emperor.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_19_">[[19]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
In any case it was easy to see that Theodora and Theoctistus would always
stand in the way of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
ruling in his own right.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_20_">[[20]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">Once</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">
Michael </a></span></b><span face="Times">was sixteen and of an age to
rule for himself, he was officially acclaimed sole ruler on 15 March 856.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_21_">[[21]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
However Theodora was distraught at the murder of her minister and not happy
at being sidelined, as she made clear to</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">
Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">. She was to continue to live
in the palace till 858, when she and her daughters were sent to the Gastria
and ta Karianou monasteries, though the Patriarch Ignatius would not tonsure
them because they went unwillingly.<sup> </sup></span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_22_">[[22]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
With Eudocia Ingerina prominent at court and the position of Eudocia Decapolitissa
only nominal, the situation of the senior empress and her daughters must
have been uncomfortable and perhaps their monastic seclusion came as a
relief. Over time, however, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael'</a></span></b><span face="Times">s
hostility towards Theodora gradually waned, and he appears to have released
his mother and sisters from the Gastria a few years later, perhaps in 863,
and allowed his mother to resume a ceremonial role at court.</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">After having Theoctistus assassinated, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
named his uncle Bardas (who was, indeed, an outstanding administrator)
<i>chartoularios
tou kanikleiou </i>(keeper of the inkstand), magistros and then domestic
of the Scholae; in 859 he was made curopalates, and on 26 April 862 Michael
crowned him Caesar, thus nominating him as his heir-apparent in the absence
of any children in the dynasty's younger generation, a situation
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
himself had done much to bring about.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_23_">[[23]]</a></span></b>
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times">Eudocia, the imperial mistress</span></b></p></center>

<p><span face="Times">What, in the meantime, of Eudocia Ingerina?&nbsp;
In the third year of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
(sole) reign, so c. 857/8, we are told that he promoted his cousin Antigonus,
one of Bardas's sons, to the post of domestic of the Scholae, while making
his other cousin domestic (commander-in-chief) of the West. This cousin
was married off to a girl called Eudocia 'who had an unsavoury reputation'.
These are not necessarily sufficient grounds on which to identify her with
our Eudocia Ingerina, as 'Eudocia daughter of Inger' is specifically named
in our sources on numerous occasions and the identification with her would
presumably have been made explicit.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_24_">[[24]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
On the other hand, Eudocia was not a particularly common name until the
later Byzantine period, and arguably there would have been few Eudocias
at court who were so notorious. It is, therefore, not unreasonable to speculate
that </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael
</a></span></b><span face="Times">may
have married his mistress to one of his cousins in order to legitimise
her social status and give her an important position in the hierarchy of
the women of the court. Once </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
mother and sisters were ensconced in convents, the wives of the remaining
members of Theodora's family (her brothers and nephews) would have held
the highest ranks alongside the nominal empress Eudocia Decapolitissa.
Additionally, Bardas's family, as </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
would have found convenient, were comfortably positioned within the palace
itself, for key figures in the regency lived within the palace precincts
and Bardas's other son, Antigonus, built a reception hall within the imperial
residence.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_25_">[[25]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">However, the young domestic of the West was to die
shortly after his marriage, and Bardas himself was then rumoured to have
taken up with his widowed daughter-in-law, Eudocia, almost immediately
after his son's death. He was pointedly criticised by the patriarch over
this liaison.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_26_">[[26]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
This would fit with the fact that, while Bardas had married Theodosia,
sister of St Irene of Chrysobalanton, as his second wife c. 855, he divorced
her c. 862, the incestuous relationship with Eudocia, or the report of
it, being perhaps the catalyst for this divorce.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_27_">[[27]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">The presumption that this loose-living Eudocia in
Bardas's household and </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
mistress were one and the same is very appealing. Certainly Bardas's marital
situation (and the moral character of his daughter-in-law) was a matter
of public knowledge and the subject of strict censure by the Patriarch
Ignatius: indeed, if there were a liaison between the emperor's uncle and
the emperor's mistress, it can hardly have been kept secret in the hot-house
world of the court. Nicetas David Paphlagon, in his <i>Life</i> of the
Patriarch Ignatius, confirms that Bardas deposed the patriarch for continually
condemning his relationship with his daughter-in-law Eudocia as incestuous
and for excommunicating him over this liaison: a further factor in Ignatius's
deposition may have been Ignatius's refusal to tonsure the empress and
her daughters, on the grounds that they became nuns unwillingly.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_28_">[[28]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Ignatius was patriarch for the first time from 4 July 847 to 23 October
858,</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_29_">[[29]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and Ignatius's deposition thus coincided both with the empress Theodora's
banishment from the palace and with the marriage and early death of Bardas's
son. But Eudocia's position in Bardas's household may purely have been
a matter of imperial convenience from </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
point of view. A marriage to <b><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></b>
short-lived cousin would have given Eudocia respectability and rank among
the imperial women without removing her from court. Whether she then became
intimate with her father-in-law after her husband's death can only be a
matter of conjecture. Perhaps Ignatius's attack on Bardas was really an
attempt to marginalise Eudocia without having to name the emperor as her
lover. Theodora, for example, might have been trying to preserve her son's
reputation and damage that of Eudocia by transferring the moral blame for
an unsavoury liaison with her onto her brother instead of implicating her
son.</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">If Eudocia had been married to Theodora's own nephew
(and was now his widow), her prominent position at court both as a close
family member and simultaneously as the imperial mistress can hardly have
been palatable to the senior empress and her daughters. Without doubt,
the palace -- and the women's quarters in particular -- must have polarised
into factions supporting the various imperial women. This embarrassing
situation might well have made retirement to a convent seem more attractive
for the empress-mother, especially if her son's mistress was simultaneously
said to be embroiled with Theodora's own brother.</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">However, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
career was to be soon indelibly altered (for the worse) when a new figure
entered his -- and Eudocia Ingerina's -- life. </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil
I</a></span></b><span face="Times">, founder of the Macedonian dynasty,
had been born in Thrace or Macedonia in the 830s.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_30_">[[30]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
For the final ten years of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
reign,</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">
Basil </a></span></b><span face="Times">was to be his constant companion,
terminating in his murder of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
on the night of 23/24 September 867. </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
career, up to his accession to the throne, seems bizarre, but whatever
the truth behind his rise to power the account we have must have seemed
credible to Byzantines, although the different versions of it surely begged
questions. It can be conjectured that at the age of about twenty-five </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></span></b><span face="Times">
had entered the service of his local strategus in Macedonia. He shortly
decided that career opportunities were better in Constantinople and, while
sleeping rough outside the church of St Diomedes near the Golden Gate,
was spotted and befriended by the sacristan of the church: the two became
adoptive brothers. The sacristan's brother was a doctor in the entourage
of Theophilitzes, a courtier and one of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
minor relatives, and this doctor recommended </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></span></b><span face="Times">
to Theophilitzes as a groom. Impressed by his physique Theophilitzes employed
him. When, on one occasion, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
was having trouble examining the teeth of a new and splendid horse which
he wished to use in his chariot team, Theophilitzes offered the services
of</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html"> Basil</a></span></b><span face="Times">,
who impressed the emperor with his skills as a horse-tamer. </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></span></b><span face="Times">
was immediately employed in the emperor's stables and from here, as might
have been expected, bearing in mind </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
passion for horses and chariot racing,</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_31_">[[31]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
became one of the emperor's most intimate companions.</span><b><a href="#N_32_">[[32]]</a></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">An alternative version has </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
skills as a wrestler bringing him to </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
notice when he defeated a visiting Bulgarian champion.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_33_">[[33]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Whatever the attraction, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
was entranced by this new companion, who is praised for his skills in hunting,
ball-playing, wrestling and jumping, discus-throwing, weight-lifting and
running.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_34_">[[34]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Accordingly </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil
</a></span></b><span face="Times">was
given increasing rank and dignities and, though Theodora is said to have
warned </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
of the danger inherent in this association (clearly she trusted </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></span></b><span face="Times">
no better than she did Eudocia Ingerina), her son took no notice.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_35_">[[35]].</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Thus it seems that </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
meeting with </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
must have taken place before Theodora's forced retirement in 858, when
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
was at the impressionable age of eighteen.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_36_">[[36]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil </a></span></b><span face="Times">was
made patrician and finally in 865 Lord Chamberlain (<i>parakoimomenos</i>),
a position which could support the suggestion that </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael
</a></span></b><span face="Times">also
engaged in a homosexual relationship (the post, which required close personal
attendance on the emperor, was generally reserved for a eunuch).</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_37_">[[37]]</a><a href="basili.html">Basil
</a></span></b><span face="Times">was
ambitious, and now it was time to give Bardas the push. </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
might also have wanted him out of the way, even if he was not the prime
mover in the plot. When on 21 April 866 the army was assembling at the
river Maeander in the Thrakesion theme for an expedition against the Arabs,
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
stood by while </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil
</a></span></b><span face="Times">assassinated
Bardas.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_38_">[[38]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">His
murder is graphically depicted in the Madrid Scylitzes manuscript.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_39_">[[39]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Indeed, the complicated and extended love-triangle (or rectangle) between
Eudocia Ingerina, Bardas, his son, and</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">
Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times"> might well have made the fact
that Bardas's genitals were paraded around the army on a pole particularly
appropriate in the circumstances -- perhaps Eudocia's relationship to his
uncle (or the public perception thereof) had become closer than </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael
</a></span></b><span face="Times">had
initially anticipated.</span>
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times">Eudocia and Basil the Macedonian</span></b></p></center>

<p><span face="Times">If there is any truth in the suggestion that Eudocia
had become the lover of Bardas, it is clear that this situation had already
been altered before the murder of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
uncle, for</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">
Basil</a></span></b><span face="Times"> the Macedonian had become Eudocia's
husband. The exact date of the marriage is not known, though it has traditionally
been located in the year 865.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_40_">[[40]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">After Bardas's murder, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
immediately abandoned his Arab expedition: the implication that the expedition
was merely a 'set up' in order to effect the easy elimination of Bardas
is inescapable. Once back in Constantinople </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
then had</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">
Basil</a></span></b><span face="Times"> crowned co-emperor by the patriarch
Photius; this took place only a month after the murder, on 26 May 866.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_41_">[[41]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Eudocia was now empress. At this point she was five months pregnant. Her
son Leo, later </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="leovi.html">Leo
VI</a></span></b><span face="Times">, was to be born on 1 September 866,
and so had been conceived late in 865.</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">The marriage to Eudocia had been effected on condition
that </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></span></b><span face="Times">
treated her with respect as his 'lady' (i.e., appropriately to her rank
as empress) and, according to the Logothete tradition, the marriage of
the imperial concubine to </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil
</a></span></b><span face="Times">was
not as straightforward as one might imagine, for </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></span></b><span face="Times">
was made to divorce an existing wife Mariawho was sent back to Macedonia
with a suitably generous pay-off. It is even possible that </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and Maria may have had children and Mango suggests not only the existence
of a daughter, Anastasia, but that </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
eldest son Constantine was Maria's and not Eudocia's.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_42_">[[42]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
The parentage not only of Constantine, but of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="leovi.html">Leo</a></span></b><span face="Times">
too has given rise to considerable conjecture: some anti-Macedonian sources,
which assume that Eudocia remained Michael's mistress during Michael's
lifetime, point out that the date of Leo's birth makes the assumption that
the child was </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
(not </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil's)</a></span></b><span face="Times">
a foregone conclusion.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_43_">[[43]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">It is possible that </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
had intended the Eudocia-Basil liaison to be only a nominal marriage, for
we are told that, by </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
desire, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil
</a></span></b><span face="Times">was
to take </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
eldest sister Thecla as his mistress.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_44_">[[44]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Thecla had been a nun and was now approximately thirty-five years of age,
but she also held the rank of an empress, having been crowned during her
father's reign.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_45_">[[45]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
She had probably returned to the palace after five or so years of monastic
seclusion with the other females of the family in 863. According to Mango,
the whole point of the charade of the marriage of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and Eudocia appears to have been to ensure that the baby with whom she
was pregnant in 866 (the future <b><a href="leovi.html">Leo VI</a></b>,
supposedly a son of<b><a href="mikeiii.html"> Michael </a></b>and not <a href="basili.html"><b>Basil</b>)</a>
would be 'born in the purple'.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_46_">[[46]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
At the same time Eudocia would have imperial status, and </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and Eudocia would be able to continue their relationship, while</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">
Basil</a></span></b><span face="Times"> would have an imperial mistress.</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">The liaison between </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and Eudocia -- and presumably that between </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and Thecla -- may have continued up till </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's
</a></span></b><span face="Times">death:
the Logothete implies that Eudocia's next son Stephen was also </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's
</a></span></b><span face="Times">and
that only <b><a href="alexanderi.html">Alexander</a></b>, the youngest of
Eudocia's three sons, was a legitimate son of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil's</a></span></b><span face="Times">.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_47_">[[47]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
While Macedonian sources insist that </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="leovi.html">Leo
</a></span></b><span face="Times">was
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
child, it can be argued that this was because it would have been too embarrassing
to reveal the existence of the <i>ménage a trois</i>, especially
Eudocia's position within it, since she was after all the future matriarch
of the Macedonian dynasty. Certainly, if she was still </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
mistress up to his death in September 867, Stephen, born two months later,
would have been <b><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></b> son as well
as </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="leovi.html">Leo.</a></span></b><span face="Times">
However the ingenious theory of Mango can be questioned.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_48_">[[48]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
One must not forget the hostility of the Logothete to the Macedonian dynasty.
The fact that Basil's eldest son, Constantine, is also said to be a son
of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and Eudocia, is overlooked.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_49_">[[49]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">This
undermines the argument that the birth of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="leovi.html">Leo</a></span></b><span face="Times">
was particularly significant. Further, it seems rather odd that </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="leovi.html">Leo</a></span></b><span face="Times">
would have been the first child of <b><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></b>
and Eudocia if they had been having an affair since <b><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></b>
was a teenager.</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">It is entirely possible (if not probable) that <b><a href="leovi.html">Leo</a></b>
was a son of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and Eudocia after all: or, of course, that even Eudocia herself was not
sure whether <b><a href="basili.html">Basil </a></b>or </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
was the father of her child. Indeed the burgeoning family of <b><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></b>
may explain the tension that developed in the relationship between <b><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></b>
and </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.hrm">Basil</a></span></b><span face="Times">;
their intense relationship began to turn sour. At a banquet following chariot
races at the palace of St Mamas which </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael
</a></span></b><span face="Times">celebrated
with </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and Eudocia, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil
</a></span></b><span face="Times">had
cause to fear for his new position when a patrician Basiliscianus (one
of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
more disreputable promotions), who had just flattered the emperor over
his chariot victory for the Blues, was invited to put on the imperial shoes:
the purple jewelled shoes were the very essence of imperial status. Both
<b><a href="basili.html">Basil
</a></b>and
Eudocia, the empress, were concerned at this suggestion that
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></span></b><span face="Times">
might be losing favour and that demotion might be on the cards. When Basiliscianus
hesitated in putting on <b><a href="basili.html">Basil's</a></b> shoes,
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
said bluntly to </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></span></b><span face="Times">,
'They suit him better than they do you. I made you emperor -- don't I have
the authority to make another?' Eudocia then burst into tears with the
words, 'The imperial dignity, O my lord, is a great thing and I too was
unworthy to have been honoured with it. But it is not right that it should
be treated with contempt.'</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_50_">[[50]]</a></span><span face="Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
told her not to distress herself: it was his firm intention to make Basiliscianus
emperor.</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">It is abundantly clear that the emperor could instantaneously
raise a courtier to the highest levels (and similarly demote one), and
after his meteoric career the co-emperor would have been only too well
aware of that fact.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_51_">[[51]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
From Eudocia's point of view her position as Augusta was under threat.
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></span></b><span face="Times">
is reported as having been both angered and distressed.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_52_">[[52]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
There is further evidence that </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
was turning against <b><a href="basili/htm">Basil</a></b>: there appears
to have been an assassination attempt on <b><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></b>
while he was out hunting, and he was deliberately omitted from the co-emperor's
usual place on Constantinople's gold and silver coinage.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_53_">[[53]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">Perhaps the most bizarre aspect of the whole matrimonial
tangle according to the Logothete's account is <b><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></b>
suggestion that </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil
</a></span></b><span face="Times">should
take <b><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's
</a></b>own sister as his mistress.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_54_">[[54]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Yet there is no evidence that Thecla objected. Her liaison with <b><a href="basili.html">Basil
</a></b>is
even confirmed by the fact that three years later, c. 870, when she sent
a man of business to </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></span></b><span face="Times">,
then securely emperor in his own right, he asked the retainer who Thecla's
(current) lover was. On being told that it was a certain Neatocomites </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil
</a></span></b><span face="Times">reacted
violently: Neatocomites was forced to become a monk and Thecla was beaten
and deprived of her property. Apart from the jealousy of an ex-lover, there
might also have been a sub-text here, as Neatocomites had unsuccessfully
tried to warn Bardas of the threat posed by <b><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></b>
the day before he was murdered: perhaps </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil
</a></span></b><span face="Times">saw
Thecla not just as unfaithful to his memory, but as disloyal to his regime.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_55_">[[55]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
This reported relationship betweern Thecla and Neatocomites, like the later
affair of Eudocia herself, gives us an interesting window into the lifestyle
possible for women of the imperial family.</span>

<p><span face="Times">The final act in this bloody Jacobean melodrama was
the removal of <b><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></b>. Now that </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></span></b><span face="Times">
had reason to believe he might be losing </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's
</a></span></b><span face="Times">favour,
time was running out for the emperor, and while he was hunting outside
the city in September 867 he was warned by a monk of a plot against him
masterminded by </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></span></b><span face="Times">.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_56_">[[56]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
The actual murder took place later that month, on the night of 23 September
867, after the 'co-imperial' couple, <b><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></b>
and Eudocia, had been invited to dinner in <b><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></b>
suburban palace of St Mamas. <b><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></b> can
hardly have taken the warning of the threat posed by <b><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></b>
very seriously: no doubt, too, he had perfect faith in Eudocia, who was
now seven months pregnant (by whom is hardly relevant in this context).
The bolt of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
bedroom door was tampered with by </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></span></b><span face="Times">
so the door could not be locked, and he was encouraged by Eudocia to get
very drunk as usual; Rentacius his<i> protovestiarios</i> (possibly <i>parakoimomenos</i>),
who would normally have slept near him, was off hunting.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_57_">[[57]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
While </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
was snoring in bed, sleeping off his wine, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and eight friends rushed into the bedroom and butchered him, after first
cutting off his hands.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_58_">[[58]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and his conspirators then rushed to the palace to secure their position.
The commander of the palace guards, Artavasdus, was informed by the conspirators
'in his own tongue' by one of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil's
</a></span></b><span face="Times">Persian
associates that </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
was dead and the new emperor wanted entry. With the palace opened up to
them, the conspiracy had succeeded.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_59_">[[59]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
The heavily pregnant Eudocia was then escorted from St Mamas to the imperial
palace 'with great honour':</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_60_">[[60]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
the implication that she had been involved in the conspiracy, not least
by lulling the tipsy </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
into a false sense of security, is unavoidable. </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></span></b><span face="Times">

on the eastern side of the Bosphorus, but significantly<b> </b></span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="leovi.html">Leo

The other Eudocia, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
widow, the 'ghost' empress, was immediately returned to her parents;</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_62_">[[62]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
her entire time as empress had been overshadowed by her unofficial rival.</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">Theodora by this point had been restored to liberty
in the palace for the last three or four years and would have played a
ceremonial role at court, if not any active part in government; perhaps
her son was pleased for her to contest the stage with his despised wife
Eudocia Decapolitissa prior to the elevation of Eudocia Ingerina as third
empress in the hierarchy. Theodora was certainly now on speaking terms
with <b><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></b>, for on the day of his death
she sent him a dinner invitation for the following day, and <b><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></b>
told Rentacius to go out hunting with other members of his entourage for
something suitable to send her to serve at dinner (which explains Rentacius's
absence from </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
chamber on the night of the murder). When Theodora heard that <b><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></b>
had been acclaimed as emperor, she rushed to the palace of St Mamas where
her son lay dead. Our last glimpse of her is when she was found by Paul
the
<i>cubicularius</i>, who had been sent to arrange <b><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></b>
burial, weeping with her daughters over <b><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's
</a></b>body,
which was wrapped in the blanket belonging to the right-hand horse (the
lead horse of the chariot team) that he drove: a nice touch -- <b><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's
</a></b>deep
affection for his horses in life was replicated at his death. We have to
wonder if one of his entourage deliberately chose this blanket as an appropriate
shroud or if it was just close at hand as if in frequent use. Perhaps Eudocia
Ingerina in the palace of St Mamas, anxiously awaiting news of <b><a href="basili.html">Basil's
</a></b>take-over
of the Great Palace and the entourage to escort her there with the full
pomp and ceremony of an empress, was the one who found the covering for
the disembowelled body of her dead lover. Maybe she, too, shed a few tears.
One can only hope that she was able to get away with her escort before
the arrival of
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
desolate mother and sisters. Eudocia's ceremonial departure from St Mamas
threw into sharp relief the way in which <b><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></b>
body was hastily shipped across the Bosphorus to Chrysopolis and unceremoniously
buried there.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_63_">[[63]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">Theodora died some time after the accession of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil
</a></span></b><span face="Times">and
was buried in the Gastria monastery, to which she probably retired again
after <b><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></b> death. The knowledge that
her son's assassin was now emperor, with his accomplice Eudocia Ingerina
as empress alongside him, must have been particularly galling.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_64_">[[64]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
At times in her monastic seclusion, with her son dead and her daughters
aging and unmarried, she can hardly have helped wondering whether she had
been altogether wise, twelve years earlier, in her attempt to stabilise
the dynastic succession by forcibly separating the teen-age <b><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael
</a></b>and
his lovely Eudocia.</span>
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times">Eudocia Augusta</span></b></p></center>

<p><span face="Times">The imperial mistress of one emperor had now succeeded
in reaching the throne as the crowned wife of his successor and assassin.
Eudocia's own views on the situation are of course a matter of conjecture,
but, whether or not she preferred </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil
'the Macedonian</a></span></b><span face="Times">' to <b><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael
'the Amorian'</a></b>, she was at least officially the empress and possessed
of all imperial dignity -- a position which must have had its attractions.
After all, while Eudocia Decapolitissa lived, she could never have become
<b><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></b>
empress, but remained just a participant in a rather shady matrimonial
intrigue, which still left her in an equivocal position at court. Any children
she openly had by <b><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></b> could never
have been 'purple-born'. Whatever her motives, outwardly, at least, her
marriage to</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">
Basil </a></span></b><span face="Times">was successful: she was to have
four further children: <b><a href="alexanderi.html">Alexander</a></b> (born
c. 870) and three daughters, Anna, Helena and Maria, though these were
to be sent to a monastery by their father.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_65_">[[65]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">In the same way that <b><a href="dora.html">Theodora</a></b>,
wife of <b><a href="justinia.html">Justinian</a></b>, was able to shake
off her disreputable past once empress and become 'more royal than the
royals', Eudocia Ingerina too enjoyed all the perquisites of imperial rank.
She was seated beside <b><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></b>, drawn by white
horses, in the triumphal procession conducted for the baptism of her son
Stephen on Christmas Day 867.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_66_">[[66]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
She is also portrayed standing between two of her sons, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="leovi.html">Leo</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and <b><a href="alexanderi.html">Alexander</a></b>, in the Paris Gregory
MS (Paris B.N. gr. 510), an illustrated manuscript containing the
<i>Homilies</i>
of St Gregory of Nazianzus, plus some of his letters, and Gregory the presbyter's
life of the saint. The manuscript was produced in Constantinople around
880 (perhaps as a gift to the emperor from the patriarch Photius).</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_67_">[[67]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Eudocia's crown is more lavish than that of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil's</a></span></b><span face="Times">,
who is depicted in a separate miniature, and she carries a sceptre in her
right hand and an orb in her left. The inscription around the miniature
focuses on Eudocia: 'Basil, emperor of the Romans, elevated you, a well-branched
vine bearing as the grapes of sovereignty the serene despots [princes]
with whom you shine, O light-bringing Eudocia'.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_68_">[[68]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
In addition, like some other Augustas of the period such as <b><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></b>
mother Theodora (but <i>not</i> Eudocia Decapolitissa), Eudocia appeared
on her husband's coinage: she had definitely been granted full imperial
status.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_69_">[[69]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Furthermore, she clearly had her own imperial funds, for at </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
accession she made liberal donations to the people.<sup> </sup></span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_70_">[[70]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">In 879, <b><a href="basili.html">Basil's</a></b> eldest
son Constantine died unexpectedly, and <b><a href="leovi.html">Leo</a></b>
became the heir apparent. Some have seen significance in the fact that
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and <b><a href="leovi.html">Leo</a></b> had a dysfunctional relationship,
arguing that it gives credence to the possibility that <b><a href="leovi.html">Leo</a></b>
was not </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
son. However it is possible that both <b><a href="leovi.html">Leo</a></b>
and his elder brother Constantine were sons of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil
</a></span></b><span face="Times">and
Eudocia, and that there are other explanations for the difficult relationship
between <b><a href="basili.html">Basil
</a></b>and <b><a href="leovi.html">Leo</a></b>.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_71_">[[71]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
There are signs that Eudocia's relationship with <b><a href="basili.html">Basil,</a></b>
too, was less than perfect also, for at about this time, c. 878, she became
romantically involved with a Nicetas Xylinites. </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.html">Basil
</a></span></b><span face="Times">punished
him by having him tonsured as a monk, though <b><a href="leovi.html">Leo</a></b>
on his accession in 886 promoted Xylinites to the position of
<i>oikonomos</i>,
or administrator of the property, of St Sophia.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_72_">[[72]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">The last we hear of Eudocia is when in 882 she supposedly
arranged a brideshow for </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="leovi.html">Leo</a></span></b><span face="Times">
as heir to the throne, at which 'he' chose Theophano, one of Eudocia's
own relatives, and a member of the Martinakioi family like herself. <b><a href="leovi.html">Leo</a></b>
was very unhappy at the choice of his bride, and Eudocia may have been
siding with her husband against her son -- or was merely following the
normal practice of aggrandising her own family.</span><b><a href="#N_73_">[[73]]</a><span face="Times"><a href="leovi.html">Leo</a></span></b><span face="Times">
already had a mistress, Zoe, daughter of Stylianus Zaoutzes, the commander
of the imperial guard, and the <i>Life</i> of the patriarch St Euthymius,
quotes </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="leovi.html">Leo</a></span></b><span face="Times">
as saying that 'all the members of the senate know that I married her [Theophano]
against my will from fear of my father and in utter distress'. When Theophano
informed her father-in-law of the fact that Zoe was </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="leovi.html">Leo's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
mistress, <b><a href="basili.html">Basil </a></b>beat him up with his fists
(<b><a href="basili.html">Basil's</a></b> earlier career as a wrestler must
have made this memorable experience) and had Zoe forcibly married off.
This intrigue between <b><a href="leovi.html">Leo</a></b> and Zoe might
have seemed merely a slight peccadillo, but, in view of the long-term consequences
arising from <b><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael III</a></b>'s liaison with
Eudocia Ingerina, <b><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></b> may well have seen
the situation as a threat to his regime; in effect, it was to prove so,
if one accepts that Zoe's father Zaoutzes was involved in plots against
<b><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></b>
in the interests of his daughter's imperial lover.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_74_">[[74]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">Eudocia was not to see her son on the throne: she
died in late 882 or early 883. Perhaps her death had some effect in worsening
the relationship between her husband and eldest son, for in 883 </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="leovi.html">Leo</a></span></b><span face="Times">
was imprisoned for three years and his supporter, the general Andrew the
Scythian, was deposed as domestic of the Scholae. </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="leovi.html">Leo</a></span></b><span face="Times">
supposedly had been slandered and unjustly accused of conspiracy by the
cleric Santabarenus, but perhaps he had been involved in a very real plot
against <b><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></b>. Certainly he was only released
and reconciled to his father just before <b><a href="basili.html">Basil's</a></b>
death, after a second conspiracy in which he could have had no part.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_75_">[[75]]</a><a href="leovi.html">Leo's
</a></span></b><span face="Times">reconciliation
with his father was stage-managed on 20 July, the feast of Elijah -- though
<b><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></b>
apparently said to the crowd on this occasion, 'Are you praising God on
account of my son? You will suffer many misfortunes and painful days on
his account!' -- which hardly sounds like a vote of confidence.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_76_">[[76]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Later, as ruler, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="leovi.html">Leo
</a></span></b><span face="Times">reinstated
Andrew the Scythian as domestic of the Scholae and personally flogged Santabarenus
and had him exiled first to Athens and then blinded and sent to the East.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_77_">[[77]]</a></span></b>
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times">Eudocia's legacy</span></b></p></center>

<p><span face="Times">In August 886 </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="basili.htm,">Basil
I</a></span></b><span face="Times"> died, supposedly from wounds sustained
during a hunting accident. Some, however, have suggested that he finally
fell victim to a conspiracy, orchestrated by Stylianus Zaoutzes, the father
of<b><a href="leovi.html"> Leo's</a></b> mistress.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_78_">[[78]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
If there was a plot, however, it is not certain that <b><a href="leovi.html">Leo
</a></b>was
an active participant. Some have also seen significance in one of <b><a href="leovi.html">Leo's</a></b>
first acts as ruler, the collection of <b><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael
III's</a></b> remains and their burial with honour in the imperial burial
place, the Church of the Holy Apostles, insisting that the body be accompanied
by both his younger brothers (Stephen and </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexanderi.html">Alexander</a></span></b><span face="Times">).
This, it can be argued, shows little respect for his recently deceased
'father' <b><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></b> and supports the hypothesis
that he was </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
son.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_79_">[[79]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
However, it is possible that<b><a href="leovi.html"> Leo </a></b>was simply
trying to atone for the bloody crime which put the Macedonian dynasty in
power.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_80_">[[80]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
The funeral oration he later delivered for <b><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></b>
in 888 gives a conventionally eulogistic picture of the family and was
perhaps intended to further stabilise the position of the dynasty. In this
funeral oration for <b><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></b> in 888, <b><a href="leovi.html">Leo</a></b>
calls his mother the 'finest of women', and 'the most aristocratic and
virtuous woman who ever lived'; states that while <b><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></b>
could have married her, Providence reserved a 'greater' destiny for her;
and asserts that she and <b><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></b> attained
the throne unwillingly and without violence. However unconvincing this
attempt to whitewash his mother and however little this reflected his real
feelings towards his parents, Macedonian sources invariably present her
as the revered matriarch of the dynasty.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_81_">[[81]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">Historians of the Macedonian dynasty, Genesius and
the Continuator of Theophanes in particular, work hard at blackening the
character of <b><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael III</a></b> in order to justify
his murder and <b><a href="basli.html">Basil's</a></b> usurpation,</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_82_">[[82]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
but his later soubriquet Michael 'the Drunkard' is hardly justified.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_83_">[[83]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
He was not the only emperor to turn aside from the stuffy conventions of
court and enjoy horse-racing, associate with jesters and buffoons, and
keep an official mistress -- in his case, Eudocia Ingerina. But while emperors
were to continue to be murdered by their best friends or their wives, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
was perhaps the only emperor to be assassinated by a combination of his
(former) best friend and his own pregnant mistress.</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">The reports of<b><a href="mikeiii.html"> Michael's</a></b>
generosity (giving christening presents of gold to his charioteers' children),
love of his horses (stables furnished with marble and running water), and
practical jokes (dressing up his favourite jester, Gryllus, to impersonate
the patriarch),</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_84_">[[84]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
make him particularly attractive to modern eyes, as do other tales of his
idiosyncratic behaviour. Most notable is the anecdote of his dining without
notice with an ordinary woman in the city and laying the table himself
when she was overcome with social embarrassment.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_85_">[[85]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
And he was a popular and successful emperor, bearing his age in mind --
after all he was only in his late twenties when he died. He had some successful
campaigns to his credit. Nor was he without discernment -- his comment
on the Photian-Ignatian schism, if it is correctly attributed to him, shows
some wit, and a proper appreciation of Bardas's motives in deposing Ignatius
as patriarch: 'Theophilus [Gryllus's proper name] is my Patriarch, Photius
is the Patriarch of the Caesar [Bardas], Ignatius of the Christians.'</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_86_">[[86]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">But to what extent was Eudocia Ingerina openly responsible
both for the licentiousness at court and the events relating to <b><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></b>
death? Clearly, however much Theodora and Theoctistus disapproved of her,
it would have been far better for the dynasty -- and for <b><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></b>
himself -- had Eudocia and <b><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael</a></b> been
allowed to marry back in 855. The consequence of preventing this had been
the creation of a tortuous series of relationships suited to <b><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></b>
play-boy mentality. If a year is a long time in politics, ten years is
an eternity for an extra-marital affair at court. Indeed this 'Scandinavian
beauty' must have shared </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
sense of humour and love of inebriate fun generally over the decade they
spent together. Perhaps in her middle age she regretted the laissez-faire
atmosphere of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
court as opposed to the strictness of that of <b><a href="basili.html">Basil</a></b>.
But no doubt she would have been comforted to know that the dynasty she
helped to found was to be in power some two centuries later, and that,
even in its last generation, her great-great-great granddaughter <a href="zoe.html">Zoe</a>
would carry on the tradition of jollity, love affairs, and festivity at
court, which <i><a href="mikeiii.html">Michael III</a></i> and Eudocia herself
had so greatly enjoyed some two hundred years earlier.</span>

13 (1986), 229-39 at 231. The title, however, belonged to the chief attendant
of the empress, especially the empress's mother for whom the title was
created by Theophilus (for his wife Theodora's mother Theoctiste Phlorina),
and could not have been held by Eudocia as empress. Perhaps after Theodora's
banishment from the palace, and prior to her own coronation, Eudocia could
have held the position as Eudocia Decapolitissa's main attendant.</span>

Chariot-horses were highly prized and loved, from classical Greece onwards:
the mares of Cimon, father of Miltiades, which won three consecutive Olympic
victories in the four-horse chariot race (536, 532, and 528 BC), were buried
prominently on the other side of the road from Cimon's own tomb outside
of Athens: Herodotus 6.103.3.</span>
