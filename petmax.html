<h3>Petronius Maximus (17 March 455 - 22 May 455)</h3>

<h3>SOURCES</h3>



<p>As in the case of all the so-called "shadow" emperors of the western Roman Empire,

there is no surviving connected account of the reign of the short-lived emperor Petronius

Maximus. His career must be reconstructed primarily from what evidence survives in the

detritus of Byzantine works that themselves do not survive <i>in toto</i>.  Most of this evidence

deals with his accession, which was intimately associated with the murder of Valentinian

III (425-455), and his death, which occurred just as the Vandals were about to sack Rome

in 455.</p>

<h3>FAMILY BACKGROUND</h3>

<p>Before becoming emperor, Petronius Maximus had a long and

distinguished senatorial career.  He was born <i>ca.</i> 397, and because his family antecedents seem to have been relatively undistinguished (and are in fact unknown: a few stray claims that he

was a descendant of <a href="madmax.html"><b>Magnus Maximus</b></a> are the sheerest speculation),

he therefore will have secured advancement primarily by virtue of

his not inconsiderable abilities.</p>

<h3>EARLY LIFE</h3>

   <p>Maximus seems to have embarked on a senatorial career <i>ca.</i> 411

A.D. by holding the office of<i> praetor</i>, which was by this time

purely ceremonial and entailed the sponsorship of lavish and expensive circus games. 

<i> Ca.</i> 415, at the age of 18, he held the office of <i>tribunus et notarius</i>, an entry-level position as an

imperial <i>factotum</i>.  Subsequently, he held a series of high-level

imperial appointments. <i> Ca.</i> 416-419 he served as <i>Comes sacrarum

largitionum</i> (Count of the Sacred Largesses, or chief treasurer),

and between 419 and 439 he was <i>Praefectus urbi Romae</i> (Prefect

of the City of Rome) twice and <i>Praefectus praetorio italiae</i>

(Praetorian Prefect of Italy).  In 433 he became Consul, he

served as Praetorian Prefect of Italy again in 439 (the same year

that<a href="avitus.html"><b> Eparchius Avitus</b></a> was Praetorian Prefect of Gaul), and in 443

he held the consulate for the second time, an extremely 

distinguished honor.  In 445 he gained the title of <i>patricius</i> (patrician), and this, coupled with his two consulates, would have made

him the highest-ranking of all Roman senators.</p>

<p>In 454, Maximus was said to have been involved in a conspiracy to murder the

Patrician and Master of Soldiers Flavius Aëtius, with whom Maximus had been competing for status.  

John of Antioch provided a fanciful and convoluted account of the reasons

for Maximus' involvement:</p>



<p>	"Valentinian, having fallen in love with the wife of Maximus, a senator,

used to play at dice with him.  When Maximus lost and was unable to pay,

the emperor took his ring.  Rising, he gave it to one of Maximus' friends so

that the man showed it to Maximus' wife and, as though from her husband,

ordered her to come to the palace to dine with him there.  She came,

thinking this the truth, and when it was announced to the emperor, he arose

and without Maximus' knowledge seduced her.  After the lovemaking the

wife went to meet her husband as he came, wailing and reproaching him as

her betrayer.  When he learned the whole story, he nursed his anger at the

emperor.  Knowing that while Aëtius was alive he could not exact vengeance, 

he laid plans through the emperor's eunuchs to destroy Aëtius..."

(<i>fr</i>.200.1: Gordon trans., p.51).</p>

<p>Maximus then was said to have connived with 

<a href="valenIII.html"><b>Valentinian III</b></a>

 at the murder of Aëtius. 

John of Antioch went on,</p>



<p>  	"The affairs of the western Romans were in confusion, and Maximus, a

well-born man, powerful and twice consul, was hostile to Aëtius, the

general of the forces in Italy.  Because he knew that Heraclius, a eunuch

who had the greatest influence with the emperor, was also hostile to Aëtius,

he made an agreement with him with the same end in view (for both were

striving to substitute their power for his).  They persuaded the emperor that

unless he quickly slew Aëtius, he would be slain by him.  Because

Valentinian was fated to come to grief by losing the defense of his office,

he approved of the words of Maximus and Heraclius and contrived the

death of Aëtius when he was about to consult him in the palace on his

resolutions and was examining proposals to bring in money. While Aëtius

was laying the matter of the revenues before him ... Valentinian jumped up

with a cry from his seat and said he would no longer stand being abused by

such treacheries... He attacked with Heraclius, for this fellow was carrying

a cleaver under his cloak (for he was <em>primicerius sacri cubiculi</em>).  Both of

them together directed their blows against the head of Aëtius and killed

him...  After he had been put to death, the emperor asked a knowledgeable

person, "Was not the death of Aëtius well accomplished?"  He answered,

"Whether well or not I do not know, but I do know that you have cut off

your right hand with your left" "(<em>fr</em>.200-201: Gordon trans., pp.51-52)</p>



<p>Maximus then hoped for advancement of his own.  John continued,</p>



<p>"After Aëtius' removal, Maximus constantly resorted to Valentinian so that

he might be advanced to the consular office.  Failing that, he wished to

attain the rank of patrician, but Heraclius did not acquiesce in his

possession of this dignity.  Acting from the same ambition, Heraclius

thwarted the ambitions of Maximus and persuaded Valentinian that having

freed himself from the oppression of Aëtius he should not transfer that

man's power to others "(<em>ibid</em>.).</p>







<p>In fact, it is not known who, if anyone at all, succeeded to Aëtius' position, which may

have remained vacant until the accession of the emperor

 <a href="avitus.html"><b>Avitus</b></a> (455-456).</p>



<h3>ACCESSION</h3>





<p>Eventually Maximus, disappointed in every regard, took out his frustrations on the

emperor himself:</p>



<p>	"Maximus, failing in both his hopes, was bitterly angry.  He summoned

Optila and Thraustila, brave Scythians who had campaigned with Aëtius

and had been assigned to attend on Valentinian, and talked to them.  He

gave and received guarantees, put the blame for Aëtius' murder on the

emperor, and urged that the better course would be to take revenge on them. 

Those who avenged the fallen man, he said, would justly have the greatest

blessings.  Not many days later, Valentinian rode in the Field of Ares with a

few bodyguards and the followers of Optila and Thraustila.  When he had

dismounted from his horse and proceeded to archery, Optila and his friends

attacked him.  Optila struck Valentinian on his temple and when turned

around to see the striker he dealt him a second blow on the face and felled

him, and Thraustila slew Heraclius.  Taking the emperor's diadem and

horse, they hastened to Maximus... "(John of Antioch <em>fr</em>.201.4-5: Gordon

trans., pp.52-53).</p>

<p> <a href="valenIII.html"><b>Valentinian's</b></a> assassination took place on 16 March 455.  There was no obvious

successor to the throne, and several candidates surfaced.  John of Antioch continued:</p>



<p>"Rome was in a state of confusion and disturbance, and the military forces

were divided among themselves, some wishing Maximus to assume the

royal power and some eager to give the throne to Maximianus, the son of

Domninus, an Egyptian merchant who had made his fortune in Italy;

Maximianus had held the position of <em>domesticus</em> [bodyguard] of Aëtius.  In

addition, Eudoxia, the wife of Valentinian, strongly favored Majorian.  But

Maximus gained control of the palace by distributing money and forced

Eudoxia to marry him by threatening her with death, thinking that his

position would be more secure.  So Maximus came to the leadership of the

Roman Empire" <em>(fr</em>.201.6: Gordon trans., pp.113-114)</p>



<p> Other sources provide briefer accounts of Maximus' accession.  The chronicler

Marcellinus observed, "The emperor Valentinian, by a ruse of the patrician Maximus, by

whose trickery Aëtius himself had perished, was cut down in the Campus Martius by

Optila and Thraustila, comrades of Aëtius.  This same Maximus seized power..." 

According to the chronicler Prosper, who seems to have been in Rome at the time, "After

this parricide had been perpetrated, Maximus, a man with a double consulate and the

patrician dignity, obtained the rule...  He not only did not punish the murderers of Valentinian,

 but he even received them in friendship, and after a few days he compelled

Valentinian's wife [Eudoxia], who had been forbidden to grieve the loss of her husband,

to marry him."  The African chronicler Victor of Tonnena likewise recalled, "Maximus, a

patrician and ex-consul, assumed the imperial power for seventy-seven days.  Then the

evil that had lain hidden became clear.  Soon he took in marriage the widow of the

emperor Valentinian, not allowing her to grieve for her husband" (<em>s.a</em>.455).</p>

<p> Maximus would have been in his late fifties when, on 17 March 455, he became

emperor.  He would have had little choice in the pardoning of 

<a href="valenIII.html"><b>Valentinian's</b></a> murderers,

especially if soldiers were involved, for he would have had no army of his own, and he

would have had to cobble together whatever military support he could.  Indeed, the

support given him by Aëtius' soldiers is difficult to explain in light of the reports that

Maximus himself was involved in Aëtius' death: either he was not as involved as court

gossips might have claimed, or he was able to find some means, perhaps of the pecuniary

kind, of satisfying Aëtius' supporters.</p>

<h3>POLICIES</h3>



<p> Little is known of Maximus' imperial policies.  Needless to say, he was not recognized

by the east.  His marriage to Eudoxia attests to his desire to attach himself to the family

of Valentinian in an effort to strengthen his claims to legitimacy.  In a similar vein, he

made his son <a href="#Note 1">Palladius Caesar</a> and married him to one of 

<a href="valenIII.html"><b>Valentinian's</b></a> daughters,

possibly <a href="eudoc.html"><b>Eudocia</b></a>

.  In Gaul, he appointed <a href="avitus.html"><b>Eparchius Avitus</b></a>,

 his colleague as prefect in

439, as <em>Magister militum praesentalis</em> ("Master of Soldiers in Attendance") and sent him

to Toulouse to secure the loyalty of the Visigoths.  Maximus also was later described as

the "patronus" of another Gaul, Serranus, a further indication of his attempts to obtain

extra-Italian support.</p>

<p>  Maximus' attempts to secure the loyalty of the army also may be reflected in the

relatively large amount of gold coinage that he struck at Rome for such a short reign.  The

use of a pearl diadem rather than rosettes on the imperial effigy may indicate a desire to

establish his own identity.  A small issue of gold at Ravenna not only demonstrates that

his rule was recognized there, but also is unusual in that it was customary for gold only to

be issued at the city in which the emperor was residing.  Maximus issued no known silver

or bronze coinage.</p>



<h3>DEATH</h3>



<p> Regarding later developments, the Byzantine chronicler Malchus reported, </p>



<p>	"Around this time [455], the empress Eudoxia, the widow of the emperor

Valentinian and the daughter of the emperor Theodosius and Eudocia,

remained unhappily at Rome and, enraged at the tyrant Maximus because of

the murder of her spouse, she summoned the Vandal Gaiseric, king of

Africa, against Maximus, who was ruling Rome.  He came suddenly to

Rome with his forces and captured the city, and having destroyed Maximus

and all his forces, he took everything from the palace, even the bronze

statues.  He even led away as captives surviving senators, accompanied by

their wives; along with them he also carried off to Carthage in Africa the

empress Eudoxia, who had summoned him; her daughter Placidia, the wife

of the patrician Olybrius, who then was staying at Constantinople; and even

the maiden Eudocia.  After he had returned, Gaiseric gave the younger

Eudocia, a maiden, the daughter of the empress Eudoxia, to his son Huneric

in marriage, and he held them both, the mother and the daughter, in great

honor "(<em>Chron</em>. 366).</p>



<p>In summoning the Vandals, 

<a href="eudox.html"><b>Eudoxia</b></a> would have been 

emulating <a href="valenIII.html"><b>Valentinian's</b></a> sister

<a href="justa.html"><b>Honoria</b></a>, who was said to have summoned Attila and the Huns just a few years earlier.</p>



<p>   Prosper graphically described Maximus' end:</p>



<p>	"But he did not enjoy such incontinence for long.  For in his second month

of rule, the approach of king Gaiseric from Africa was announced, and

when many panicked crowds fled from the city, when he himself also

fearfully desired to depart, having given everyone the liberty to flee, he was

butchered by the imperial slaves on his seventy-seventh day of rule [22

May 455].  His dismembered body was cast into the Tiber, and he did not

have a tomb."</p>



<p>  Victor of Tonnena likewise continued,</p>



<p>	"But worse things followed upon this wickedness [the forced marriage to

Eudoxia] when Maximus feared the arrival of Gaiseric, king of the Vandals,

and he gave freedom to all those wishing to flee the city.  But before he

could accomplish the flight that he himself was contemplating he was killed

and thrown into the Tiber River torn limb from limb.  On the third day after

Maximus was killed, Gaiseric, king of the Vandals, entered Rome and

during fourteen whole days denuded the city of all its riches and took with

him the daughters and wife of Valentinian and many thousands of captives. 

The intercession of Pope Leo restrained him from arson, torture, and

murder "(<em>s.a</em>.455).</p>



<p>Even Victor indicates that the Vandals did not commit "Vandalism" during their genteel

sack of Rome.  And one presumes that Maximus' son <a href="#Note 1"><b>Palladius</b></a> died at the same time as

his father.</p>



<p>   According to Hydatius, moreover, Maximus not only feared the popular tumult, but also

was implicated both in the murders committed by Valentinian and in Valentinian's own

murder.  He then desired to abdicate ("<i>cum imperium deserere vellet</i>"), and was killed in

a military sedition as he tried to flee.  The <em>Gallic Chronicle of 511</em> says more succinctly,

"Maximus held power for seventy days, for he was killed in a crowded tumult during the

Vandal terror, and soon Gaiseric looted Rome, having entered without fire and sword." 

Jordanes added, "Indeed, Maximus, while he was fleeing, was killed by a certain Ursus, a

Roman soldier" (<em>"Maximus vero fugiens a quodam Urso, milite Romano, interemptus

est</em>": <em>Getica</em> 235).  And Sidonius makes the cryptic comment, regarding Maximus'
murder, "the Burgundian, with his traitorous leadership, extorted the panic-fury that led to

an emperor's slaughter" ("... <em>infidoque tibi Burdundio ductu / extorquet trepidas mactandi

principis iras</em>": <em>Carm</em>. 7.742-743).</p>



<p>  The identity of this "faithless Burgundian" whom Sidonius declines to name and whose

actions created the panic that led to Maximus' death is unknown.  But it would seem quite

likely, given that none of Maximus' Italian generals except for the Count of the Domestics

Majorian are known, that this Burgundian was one of Maximus' generals, perhaps even a

Master of Soldiers of Gaul, who somehow failed to do his duty.  Two Burgundian leaders

at this time were Chilperic and Gundioc, who accompanied the Visigothic king Theodoric

in his invasion of Spain in late 455 (Jordanes, <em>Getica</em> 231).  One or the other of these

might be the Burgundian about whom Sidonius had special knowledge and who earlier in

455 played a role, even if only by failing to perform his duty, in Maximus' fall.  Gundioc,

it might be noted, was serving in the office of Master of Soldiers of Gaul by 463.</p>



<p>  Meanwhile, two days after Maximus' death, on 24 May, the Vandals entered Rome, and

the city then experienced a leisurely fourteen-day sack that removed much of value that

the Visigoths had missed in 410.  The imperial palace was stripped, churches were

despoiled, even half of the roof of the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus was taken.  Also

seized were the spoils taken from Jerusalem by Titus in the year 73.  At least one of the

spoil-laden vessels sank on the return to Carthage, and awaits modern discovery.</p>



<p> Soon thereafter, in Gaul, Maximus' appointee <a href="avitus.html"><b>Avitus</b></a> was himself proclaimed emperor. 

Ironically, it was Avitus' son-in-law, the Gallo-Roman poet Sidonius Apollinaris who,

writing to the aforementioned Serranus (<em>Epist</em>. 2.13), pronounced an epitaph on Maximus, 

</p>



<p>	"I received your letter dedicated to the praises of your patron, the emperor

Maximus...  You call him "most happy" because he passed through the

highest offices of state and died an emperor.  I can never agree with the

opinion that those men should be called happy who cling to the steep and

slippery summits of the state...  He, although he had climbed up into the

high offices of prefect, patrician, consul, and had, with unsatisfied ambition, claimed a second turn in some of these offices, nevertheless when he

arrived still vigorous at the top of the imperial precipice, felt his head swim

with dizziness under the diadem, and could no more endure to be the master

of all than he had before endured to be under a master.  Think of the

popularity, the authority, the permanence of his former manner of life, and

compare them with the origin, the tempestuous course, the close of his two-months' sovereignty, and you will find that the least happy portion of his life

was that in which you style him "most happy."  So it came to pass that ...

when he had been hailed as Augustus, and with that vain show of majesty

had been shut up, a virtual prisoner, within the palace walls, he lamented

before twilight came the fulfillment of his ambitious hopes.  Now a host of

cares forbade him to indulge in his former measure of repose, he had

suddenly to break off all his old rules of life, and perceived when it was too

late that the business of an emperor and the ease of a senator could not go

together.  Moreover, the worry of the present did not blind him to the

calamities that were to come, for he who had trodden the round of all his

other courtly dignities with tranquil step, now found himself the powerless

ruler of a turbulent court, surrounded by tumults of the legionaries, tumults

of the populace, tumults of the barbarian allies, and the forebodings thus

engendered were but too surely justified when the end came, an end quick,

bitter, and unexpected, the last perfidious stroke of fortune, which had long

fawned upon the man, and now suddenly turned and stung him to death

with a scorpion's tail.  A man of letters, who by his talents well deserved

the rank that he bore of quaestor (I mean Fulgentius), used to tell me that he

had often heard Maximus say, when cursing the burden of empire and

regretting his old freedom from cares, "Ah, happy Damocles!  It was only

for one banquet's space that you had to endure the necessity of reigning""

[Translation based upon Hodgkin, <em>Italy</em>, pp.223-225].</p>



<h3>EPILOGUE</h3>



<p>   The reign of Petronius Maximus brought to an end the dynasty of Valentinian and

Theodosius, which had provided stability ever since 364, even during the troubled years

of the fifth century under <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius</b></a>

 (395-423) and <a href="valenIII.html"><b>Valentinian III</b></a>

 (425-455).  Maximus

was the first of the so-called "shadow" emperors who would oversee the last years of the

western Roman Empire.  Already with the death of Aëtius in 454, the chronicler Count

Marcellinus opined, "And with him died the western empire, nor since then has it been

able to recover."  And as for Maximus' own legacy, the historian Priscus did not deign

even to mention his name, merely commenting, "There were, moreover, still other

emperors in the west, but although I know their names well, I shall make no mention of

them whatsoever.  For it so fell out that they lived only a short time after attaining the

office, and as a result of this accomplished nothing worthy of mention..." (<em>Bellum

Vandalicum</em> 7.15-17: Dewing trans., p.69)</p>

<h3><b>Palladius</b></h3>







 <p> According to Hydatius, Palladius was the son from an earlier

marriage of the short-lived emperor Petronius Maximus (455).  He

was named Caesar and married to an unnamed daughter of <a href="valenIII.html"><b>Valentinian III (425-455)</b></a>, perhaps <a href="eudoc.html"><b>Eudocia</b></a>.  Nothing further is heard of

him, and he presumably was killed at about the same time as his

father, in late May of 455, in the confusion accompanying the

Vandal sack of Rome.</p>
