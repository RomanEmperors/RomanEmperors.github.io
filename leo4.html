<h3>
Leo IV (775-780 A.D.)</h3></center>

<center><b>Lynda Garland</b>
<br>University of New England, New South Wales</center>

<p>Leo IV is often considered primarily as an appendage of his redoubtable
wife and successor<b><a href="irene.html"> Irene,</a></b> from whose point
of view all our historical sources are written -- this is due partly to
the brevity of his reign, as well as to the fact that it was very much
in the interests of his widow to rewrite history in her own favour.&nbsp;
Leo was the son and heir of the committed iconoclast emperor<b><a href="constanv.html">
Constantine V</a></b>, who married three times: by his first wife, <b><a href="irenev.html">Irene
the Khazar</a></b>,<b><a href="#N_1_">[[1]]&nbsp;</a></b> he had one son,
Leo, in January 750; his second marriage was childless; and his third marriage,
to <b><a href="eudociav.html">Eudocia</a></b>, produced five sons and a
daughter.<b><a href="#N_2_">[[2]]&nbsp;</a></b> Leo was crowned co-emperor
by his father in 751, and in December 769 married
<b><a href="irene.html">Irene</a></b>,
a member of the Sarandapechys family from Athens, in the chapel of St Stephen
in the Daphne palace adjoining the Great Palace. Their only son Constantine
(named after his grandfather) was born on 14 January 771.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
choice of<b><a href="irene.html"> Irene</a></b> as an imperial bride is
surprising, both because her family was not particularly prominent and
because of the reverence for icons which she later displayed. Nevertheless,
even in the family of <b><a href="constanv.html">Constantine V</a></b>,
discreet iconophilism and devotion to certain saints and monastic institutions,
seems to have been expected of imperial women: certainly
<b><a href="constanv.html">Constantine's
</a></b>third
wife <b><a href="eudociav.html">Eudocia</a></b> patronised the monastery
of St Anthusa of Mantineon. It is also possible, as suggested by Cedrenus
below, that <b><a href="irene.html">Irene</a></b> may have been expected
by her father-in-law prior to her marriage to swear an oath that she would
not publicly reverence icons.
</p><p>On Constantine V's death in August 775 Leo IV succeeded to the throne
at the age of twenty-five years.<b><a href="#N_3_">[[3]]</a> </b>He crowned
his five-year old son <b><a href="connievi.html">Constantine </a></b>not
long after his accession, on Easter Sunday, 14 April 776.&nbsp; On Good
Friday Leo had imposed an oath on the army, senate, tagmata (the elite
regiments stationed in Constantinople) and people 'by the holy and life-giving
Cross' that they would accept no other emperor but himself and his son
the young emperor <b><a href="connievi.html">Constantine</a></b> and their
descendants. Perhaps to reassure his five younger half-brothers that they
were not entirely to be side-lined, on the next day, Holy Saturday, he
appointed his youngest brother Eudocimus to the rank of
<i>nobilissimus</i>,
and his brothers were then associated with him in the crowning of the young
<b><a href="connievi.html">Constantine</a></b>
on Holy Sunday. Despite this, his actions sparked off a conspiracy in May
focused round the second eldest of his brothers, the Caesar <b><a href="nicephi.html">Nicephorus:
Nicephorus</a></b> was to be the centre of opposition to <b><a href="irene.html">Irene's</a></b>
regime on a number of occasions. Leo easily put down the conspiracy, which
included a number of persons in the imperial service, and showed leniency
to those involved by having them scourged and tonsured and banishing them
to the Cherson and the Klimata under guard.<b><a href="#N_4_">[[4]]</a></b>
</p><p>It was only to be expected that Leo would continue his father's iconoclast
and anti-monastic policies, which were so popular with sections of the
army and particularly the tagmata. Leo, however, appears to have taken
a far more moderate stance on religious issues than <b><a href="constanv.html">Constantine
V</a></b>, though still supporting iconoclasm, and Theophanes speaks of
him using his father's money to win favour with the people and the notables
and as initially appearing to be pious and 'a friend of the Holy Mother
of God and of the monks'. He began by appointing some monks as bishops
and removing the disabilities imposed on monasteries by his father: in
this he seems to have been following a policy of promoting iconoclast monasteries
which would be subordinate to the ecclesiastical hierarchy. In 780, when
the 'Slav eunuch' Patriarch Nicetas died, Leo appointed Paul of Cyprus
to the patriarchate. Paul is depicted by Theophanes as having iconophile
sympathies and only accepting the appointment under duress, though it is
hardly likely that Leo would have chosen a patriarch hostile to his policies:
Paul however, was more moderate than his predecessors. Nevertheless, shortly
afterwards, Leo seems to have renewed the persecution of iconophiles which<b><a href="constanv.html">
Constantine V</a></b> had instituted in the 760s. In August, a number of
prominent courtiers were arrested, scourged, tonsured and imprisoned; we
are told that Theophanes the <i>cubicularius</i> and <i>paracoimomenus</i>
died under the treatment.<b><a href="#N_5_">[[5]]</a></b> Cedrenus, a later
source, records that <b><a href="irene.html">Irene </a></b>was involved
and that Leo had found two icons in her possession:
</p><p>'In the mid-week of Lent he [Leo IV] found under [literally 'in'] the
pillow of his wife Irene two icons. Having beheld them and made an investigation,
he discovered that the <i>papias</i> of the palace and some others of the
<i>primicerii</i>
had brought them. He subjected them to many tortures and punishments. As
for his wife Irene, he rebuked her severely and set her at naught, saying,
"Was this what you swore to my father the Emperor upon the fearsome and
pure mysteries of our faith?" She affirmed that she had not seen them [the
icons]. He spurned her and had no more marital relations with her.'<b><a href="#N_6_">[[6]]</a></b>
</p><p>It is possible that <b><a href="irene.html">Irene</a></b> may have been
a focus for iconophile sympathisers and she was perhaps deliberately trying
to fill the palace with iconophile supporters, hence this crack-down, which
shows Leo as a committed iconoclast trying to clean up his palace and court
by ridding them of unacceptable and 'unorthodox' religious practices. The
<i>papias</i>
-- in this case Jacob, who was also a <i>protospatharius</i><b><a href="#N_7_">[[7]]</a></b>
-- was a eunuch in charge of the palace buildings and keys, and thus all
access to the palace; the <i>primicerii</i> here referred to appear to
have been eunuch courtiers, who would of course have been able to associate
freely with the empress. Prior to this relationship between Leo and <b><a href="irene.html">Irene</a></b>
appear to have been good: at least, in 776/7 he married her cousin to Telerig,
the Bulgarian ruler, who had taken refuge in Constantinople and was made
a patrician and baptised in the Orthodox religion.<b><a href="#N_8_">[[8]]</a></b>
</p><p>Little is known about Leo's other activities as ruler, although he sent
an army 100,000 strong against the Arabs in northern Syria under the command
of the committed iconoclast general Michael Lachanodracon in 778. His strategy
in Asia Minor against the Arabs has been seen both as successful and as
primarily defensive -- securing Byzantine-held fortresses and hindering
Arab raiding parties, while avoiding direct conflict.<b><a href="#N_9_">[[9]]</a></b>
The multi-theme expedition of 778 besieged Germanicia -- though Theophanes
(a biased source) claims that the Arabs bribed Lachanodracon to withdraw
-- and achieved some success against an Arab army in an engagement in which
5 emirs and 2,000 Arabs were said to have fallen: the generals were awarded
a triumph for this victory. The expedition was also involved in capturing
heretical Syrian Jacobites who were then resettled in Thrace.<b><a href="#N_10_">[[10]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
As Lachanodracon was one of <b><a href="constanv.html">Constantine V's</a></b>
more trusted ministers, and a notorious persecutor of monks,<b><a href="#N_11_">[[11]]</a></b>
it is clear that Leo had no reservations about employing iconoclasts in
top army positions. This defensive policy continued to be successful in
779, when a large Arab army advanced to Dorylaeum (while a further success
was again achieved by Michael Lachanodracon against an Arab raiding party
in 780):
</p><p>'the emperor ordered the strategoi [generals] not to fight an open war,
but to make the forts secure by stationing garrisons of soldiers in them.
He appointed high-ranking officers at each fort and instructed them to
take each 3,000 chosen men and to follow the Arabs so as to prevent them
from spreading out on pillaging raids, while burning in advance the horses'
pasture and whatever other supplies were to be found. After the Arabs had
remained fifteen days at Dorylaion, they ran short of necessities and their
horses were hungry and many of them perished. Turning back, they besieged
Amorion for one day. But finding it fortified and well-armed, they withdrew
without achieving any success.'<b><a href="#N_12_">[[12]]</a></b>
</p><p>Leo also continued <b><a href="constanv.html">Constantine's</a></b> development
of the tagmata (the guard regiments in Constantinople) as an elite force
in the field. In 776, shortly after his accession, he transferred a number
of soldiers from theme armies into the tagmata, which caused army unrest
-- officers of the theme armies marched with their troops on Constantinople
and were only pacified with difficulty.<b><a href="#N_13_">[[13]] </a></b>Leo's
death of a fever on 8 September 780, while campaigning against the Bulgarians,
allowed <b><a href="irene.html">Irene</a></b> to reverse his policies at
the earliest possible opportunity. The rumour was current -- perhaps put
about by <b><a href="irene.html">Irene</a></b> or her supporters -- that
Leo had died of an illness contracted after taking and wearing the jewelled
crown from the Great Church of St Sophia, which had been dedicated there
by <b><a href="mauricius.html">Maurice</a></b> or <b><a href="heraclis.html">Heraclius</a></b>:
</p><p>'On 8 September of the 4<sup>th</sup> indiction Constantine's son Leo
died in the following manner. Being inordinately addicted to precious stones,
he became enamoured of the crown of the Great Church, which he took and
wore on his head. His head developed carbuncles and, seized by a violent
fever, he died after a reign of 5 years less 6 days.'<b><a href="#N_14_">[[14]]</a></b>
</p><p>Whether <b><a href="irene.html">Irene</a></b> deliberately had this story
circulated or not, it implies an attempt to smear her husband's memory,
which her triumphant return of the crown in full imperial procession on
Christmas Day 780 would have emphasised.<b><a href="#N_15_">[[15]]</a></b>
Leo was buried, with other members of the imperial family including his
father, in the church of the Holy Apostles.<b><a href="#N_16_">[[16]]</a></b>
