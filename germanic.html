<h3>Introduction</h3>



<p>Germanicus Julius Caesar <a href="#N_1_"><b>[[1]]</b></a> was born 

in 15 BC to Nero Claudius Drusus

(Drusus the Elder, the son of <a href="auggie.html"><b>Augustus'</b></a> 

wife Livia by her earlier marriage)

and Antonia Minor (Augustus' niece, the daughter of Mark Antony and his

sister Octavia). There is no record of his birth name, but it was probably

that of his father or possibly Tiberius Claudius Nero. His father's brother

(the future emperor <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>) named his 

son after Drusus, and Drusus may

have reciprocated. Drusus was awarded the honorific name of Germanicus

posthumously for his successful campaigns against German tribes, and it

passed to his sons when he died in 9 B.C. Germanicus was known by that name

in antiquity and has been even since. His heritage was auspicious and his

career promising, but an early death (AD 19) kept him from achieving the

prize of the principate.  He nonetheless influenced history for the next

fifty years and was the father of one emperor, the brother of another, and

the grandfather of a third. <a href="#N_2_"><b>[[2]]</b></a></p>



<h3>Early Advancement</h3>



<p>In A. D. 4, the aging <a href="auggie.html"><b>Augustus</b></a> found it necessary to make another in the

series of arrangements with which he expected to provide for the

continuation of the principate after his death. It would be the last. The

previous one, the adoption of his grandsons Gaius and Lucius, failed when

the young men died in AD 2 and 4. At this point he adopted his stepson

<a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>, now in his late forties, and 

Agrippa Postumus, his last surviving

grandson, and he had <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> adopt 

Germanicus despite the fact that

<a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> had a son of his own, Nero 

Claudius Drusus (Drusus the Younger),

who was a few years younger than Germanicus. Adoption changed the names of

all these candidates, and Germanicus became Germanicus Julius Caesar.

 <a href="#N_3_"><b>[[3]]</b></a>

Experience had taught <a href="auggie.html"><b>Augustus</b></a> that 

multiple heirs were in order. <a href="#N_4_"><b>[[4]]</b></a></p>



<p>The settlement of AD 4 included a plan for Germanicus to marry Agrippina

(Agrippina the Elder), a daughter of <a href="auggie.html"><b>Augustus'</b></a> daughter Julia by Marcus

Agrippa. It was a productive union in more ways than one. Not only did

Agrippina offer the prestige of her Julian blood to the Claudian branch of

the family but she proved exceptionally fertile, bearing Germanicus nine

children in the next fourteen years. Six survived their father. They were

security for the dynasty, contributed to Germanicus' popularity, and became

players in the political intrigues of the mid-first century. <a href="#N_5_"><b>[[5]]</b></a></p>



<p>Germanicus was advanced quickly as was usual, with the young men of the

imperial family destined for important careers. He embarked on the <i>cursus

honorum</i>, the series of magistracies that culminated in the consulship by

being allowed to stand for the quaestorship in AD 7 at the age of 20,

five years before the prescribed minimum. He skipped the next stage, the

praetorship, and proceeded directly to the consulship in 12. In the

intervening years, he held subordinate commands on the Danube frontier

under his uncle <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius </b></a>(AD 7-9), and 

was rewarded with the <i>ornmenta

triumphalia</i> (AD 9), the trappings of the triumph without the parade, and

with the perquisites of a praetor when he was in the senate. That same year

<a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> was transferred to the Rhine 

frontier in response to the disaster

that befell P. Quinctilius Varus when he and three legions were trapped,

massacred and their standards captured at the <a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;teutob1.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=471&quot;)"> <b>Battle of the 

Teutoburg Forest</b></a>. Germanicus joined <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> in

Germany in 11.  He spent the year 12 in Rome as consul. <a href="#N_6_"><b>[[6]]</b></a> His position as

second in line for the principate had strengthened. Although <a href="auggie.html"><b>Augustus</b></a> was

still alive, he was feeble, and <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>, positioned to succeed him, was in

his fifties, a more advanced age in ancient Rome than it is today. One

contender from Germanicus' own generation, Agrippa Postumus, evidently

impatient of his subordinate position, had fallen from favor and was

dispatched to increasingly remote places of exile after AD 6. <a href="#N_7_"><b>[[7]]</b></a> The

other, Drusus the Younger was advancing in parallel but a few years behind.</p>



<h3>Command in the West</h3>



<p>So far, Germanicus had been fighting as a deputy of <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>, but in 13

<a href="auggie.html"><b>Augustus </b></a>made him governor of Upper and Lower Germany, west of the Rhine,

administratively part of Gallia and Belgica.  With the appointment came the

command of eight legions, four attached to each province. <a href="auggie.html"><b>Augustus</b></a> died in August of

AD 14, and the stability of the Empire was tested by the first transfer of

power. Mutinies stemming from grievances about pay and discharge broke out

simultaneously on the Danube and German frontiers, and the legionaries in

the West used the uncertainty of events in Rome to offer their allegiance

to Germanicus, who was the man on the spot. They offered to swear to him as

their new <i>imperator</i> rather than to <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>. Germanicus extricated himself

by means that were less than admirable, although in his defense it can be

said that the situation was tense and very difficult. To his credit he

refused to accept their oath of allegiance, but when he tried to quiet them

by threatening suicide, some (to his embarrassment) moved to accept his

offer. His solution was essentially to pay them off; he effected it by

forging a letter from <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> that gave them all that they wanted. But

unrest continued, for when <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius'</b></a> envoys came from Rome, they were

almost killed because the soldiers understood that the letter was a forgery

and thought that the envoys intended to nullify the promises that

Germanicus had made. Threats were made against his wife and son <a href="gaius.html"><b>Gaius</b></a>

(Caligula) who were with him at his headquarters. Germanicus had to bargain

with them to allow his pregnant wife to depart for safer quarters. When it

was over, he chose a coward's method of discipline when he turned them

loose on one another to settle scores for themselves. Finally, he diverted

them with a brief military excursion. <a href="#N_8_"><b>[[8]]</b></a></p>



<p>Germanicus was nonetheless a popular leader. Loyalty to a field commander

was usually a given, his connections with <a href="auggie.html"><b>Augustus</b></a> were helpful, and the

display of his small son dressed like a little soldier (<a href="gaius.html"><b>Caligula</b></a> = "Little

Boots") was an effective public relations gambit. During the next two years

Germanicus made major incursions into German territory east of the Rhine

following the example of his father's campaigns of 12-9 BC. In AD 15 he

marched against the Chatti and then against the Cherusci led by the

charismatic chieftain Arminius. In the course of the campaign, one of the

standards lost with Varus' legions was recovered, important symbolically

because it reversed the shame of the legion's annihilation. When they found

themselves in the region of the Teutoburg Forest, the site of the massacre,

they buried the Roman bones that has been left there. The Germans harassed

the Romans as they returned to the safety of the Rhine and their winter

camps beyond. Roman invasions of Germany were always indecisive, because

Rome was never able to hold territory against an enemy that faded away

after defeat only to return. The terrain was wooded and often water-logged,

and the Germans had the tactical advantage of maneuverability. <a href="#N_9_"><b>[[9]]</b></a>

</p>

<p>In the spring of the next year (AD 16) Germanicus went east again, this

time embarking his force on ships that sailed down the Rhine and then

through the canal that had been engineered by his father Drusus a

generation earlier in order to enter on the North Sea. From there they

sailed East to the mouth of the river Ems and proceeded upstream to

penetrate German territory. They then marched eastward to the river Weser,

crossed it and engaged Arminius in battle at a site named Idistaviso.  The

Roman victory there marked the nominal submission of all the tribes west of

the river Elbe, an important boundary because it was the furthest

penetration of his father's incursion in 9 BC. The Romans were successful

(as always) against the Germans in pitched battle, but (as always) this was

not a permanent territorial conquest. Germanicus sent most of his force

back by way of the same water route as they had come, and they were caught in a

costly storm on the North Sea. By the end of the campaigning season the

legions were in their winter quarters west of the Rhine, but not before a

second of the three standards lost with Varus had been recovered. <a href="#N_10_"><b>[[10]]</b></a></p>



<p>In the meantime, Germanicus had been granted a full triumph by <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>. It

was the last that any general who was not a reigning emperor would be given

and even then was reserved for someone close to the throne. The award was

made in AD 15, but Germanicus delayed coming home to celebrate it and

continued to operate in the field through 16; allegedly he wanted to keep

on later still. The triumph took place on May 26, AD 17, and his five living children

rode with him in the parade as an advertisement for a long an stable

future. <a href="#N_11_"><b>[[11]]</b></a> Tacitus intimates that <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> had brought him back to Rome

because he did not trust him at the head of a large military force and that

he had substituted the honor of the triumph for the field command. Popular

perception assumed that Germanicus was a threat to his adoptive father. In

reality, <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> may have understood that indecisive stabs east of the

Rhine were a futile waste of resources and that it was time to stop. As for

Germanicus' anticipating the principate, he could be patient; <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> was

now almost sixty. And he had already resisted temptation once. <a href="#N_12_"><b>[[12]]</b></a></p>



<h3>Command in the East</h3>



<p>In 18, Germanicus was consul again, and this time he shared the honor with

the emperor, a distinction reserved for an intended heir. When he entered

office, he was already on his way to a new command in the East. <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>

had given him <i>maius imperium</i> over the territory east of the Adriatic, a

command that was not limited geographically but superseded the authority of

all the governors in the area. The need for the extraordinary power was

dictated by the unsettling effect of power struggles within Rome's client

territories of Asia Minor and also by the necessity of giving Germanicus a

responsibility commensurate with his status. Germanicus approached his new

base (Antioch in the imperial province of Syria) by way of a grand tour of

the eastern Mediterranean, touching on Actium, the site of the final

showdown between his great-uncle <a href="auggie.html"><b>Augustus</b></a> and his grandfather Mark Antony,

on Athens, and on the site of ancient Troy. Along the way, Agrippina gave

birth on the island of Lesbos to their last child, Julia Livilla. <a href="#N_13_"><b>[[13]]</b></a></p>



<p>Once in Syria Germanicus quickly came into conflict with Cn. Calpurnius

Piso, whom <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> had appointed as governor of that province at the time

when Germanicus received <i>maius imperium</i>. Piso was "a man of intractable

temper with  family history of hostility to the Caesars," <a href="#N_14_"><b>[[14]] </b></a>and in

Germanicus he recognized the beginnings of hereditary monarchy. Each

probably thought that the other was exceeding his jurisdiction, and their

wives acted out their rivalry. Piso's wife (Munatia) Plancina reviewed

military maneuvers in answer to what can be assumed to be Agrippina's

display of her son <a href="gaius.html"><b>Gaius</b></a>, who had evidently been brought along in order to

replay the success that he had had as 'little boots' with the troops on the

German frontier. The rumor arose that <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> had appointed Piso for the

specific purpose of monitoring Germanicus. <a href="#N_15_"><b>[[15]]</b></a></p>



<p>Germanicus fulfilled his mandate to display a Roman presence in the area

and to settle internal affairs. In the client kingdom of Armenia, he

crowned Artaxias, who was a friendly ally, and installed the first Roman

governor of the new province of  Cappadoccia. <a href="#N_16_"><b>[[16]]</b></a> In AD 19, he left Asia

Minor and visited Egypt. He went, it was said, in response to famine but

the trip included a sightseeing tour, rather in the spirit of his initial

journey to the East. He was warmly received when he moved unpretentiously

among the populace and especially when he opened the doors of the grain

storehouses. He was displaying <i>civilitas</i> (citizen-like behavior) and

<i>liberalitas</i> (generosity), virtues associated with imperial largesse. He was

upstaging <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>. He was either oblivious to the effect of his behavior

or he was intentionally testing the waters. His action was aggravated by

the fact that all men of senatorial rank were strictly forbidden to set

foot in Egypt, which was under the emperor's personal control.<a href="#N_17_"><b> [[17]]</b></a> His

visit and his grandstanding there, if arguably appropriate for the

'almost-emperor' that he was, understandably irked the actual emperor. <a href="#N_18_"><b>[[18]]</b></a></p>



<h3>Germanicus' Death and the Trial of Piso</h3>



<p>When Germanicus returned to Syria at the end of summer, he found that Piso

had undone arrangements that he had made and was harassing his party of

aides and advisors. Hostility became open, and Germanicus renounced

<i>amicitia</i> (friendship) with Piso, banished him from his company, and may

have ordered him from his post and from the province as well. Piso claimed

that he had. If he did he was arguably within the authority of his <i>maius

imperium</i> although Piso was <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius'</b></a> appointee. In any case, Piso did

abandon his command. He went to an island off the coast so that he could

return if the opportunity should arise. It seemed possible since Germanicus

had fallen ill shortly after his return from Egypt. He suspected that Piso

had cursed him by placing devotional objects (human remains, lead tablets

and the like) in his house and was in the process of poisoning him. <a href="#N_19_"><b>[[19]]</b></a></p>



<p>Germanicus died in Antioch on October 10, AD 19.  Rumor had it that his

corpse bore marks of poison: black and blue marks, foaming at the mouth, a

heart that would not burn on the funeral pyre. Eulogies compared him with

Alexander, who had died at the same age. <a href="#N_20_"><b>[[20]]</b></a> His aides in Syria appointed

Cn. Sentius to fill the post abandoned by Piso. Piso reasserted himself

and tried to regain the governorship, claiming that Germanicus had forced

him from the province illegally in order to be free to attempt a coup

against <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>. His reentry to Syria with a military force was easily

countered and he was sent back to Rome to stand trial for treason. <a href="#N_21_"><b>[[21]]</b></a></p>



<p>Agrippina returned to Rome with her husband's ashes early the next year (AD

20), coming home accompanied by the two children who were with her, <a href="gaius.html"><b>Gaius</b></a>

(Caligula) and the baby Julia Livilla. There are reports of overwhelming

grief in Rome; the people had looked forward to a new <i>princeps</i> to whom they

could attach their emotions. At the present, they had only <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>, who

seems to have been genuinely oblivious to the need to act the role of

nurturing monarch, a role already expected in the young Empire. Germanicus'

ashes were placed in the mausoleum of <a href="auggie.html"><b>Augustus</b></a> and there was a lengthy

period of mourning. But what gave closure to Germanicus' story was the

trial of Piso. <a href="#N_22_"><b>[[22]]</b></a></p>



<p>Germanicus' circle lost the focus of their hopes when he died, for he took

with him their expectation of being close to the center of power in the

near future. Those who had been with him in the East returned to Rome and

were waiting to challenge Piso and Plancina, who came back bluffing their

innocence of any kind of wrongdoing. Piso was tried in the senatorial court

as was appropriate since the wronged party was the emperor's son. The

primary charge was treason -- insubordination and the inciting of sedition

-- with an additional charge of poisoning. The prosecution's case in regard

to poison was weak, but Piso was manifestly guilty of treason. When he saw

that his case was lost, he killed himself before the trial ended. His wife

was cleared through the influence of her close friend Livia, <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius'</b></a>

mother. <a href="#N_23_"><b>[[23]]</b></a></p>



<p>Tacitus gives the fullest report of the trial, and his account has been

proved essentially accurate by a recently discovered bronze tablet which

gives the official version of the trial and its result. <a href="#N_24_"><b>[[24]]</b></a> The issue was

indeed treason, not poison, and <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> was concerned to appear impartial.

Tacitus departs from the official version with the addition of a rumor that

Piso had in his possession a letter from <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> instructing him in regard

to Germanicus and that he intended to show it to the senate and implicate

<a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> in what had taken place in Syria. He further implies that Piso's

death might not have been a suicide but an execution to prevent the

disclosure. In a sense the bronze tablet corroborates Tacitus' innuendo,

for the careful and detailed report that was set up in every legionary camp

in the Empire shows the unpopular <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> on the defensive and confirms

that the trial was a crisis for him. <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> now faced a truly difficult

rival. Dead, perhaps martyred, Germanicus remained a formidable force in

Roman politics. <a href="#N_25_"><b>[[25]]</b></a></p>



<h3>Legacy</h3>



<p>The successor's mantle now fell on Drusus, <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius'</b></a> natural son. But where

were those to look who had pinned their future careers to Germanicus? His

oldest sons, Nero and Drusus Caesar, were about 15 and 13, and Agrippina

held determinedly to her husband's memory for their sakes. When Drusus died

a few years later (AD 23), these two were heirs prospective although still

young and vulnerable to the ambitions of older men. But  a new force had

arisen in the court. L. Aelius Sejanus, the praetorian prefect (chief

officer of the palace guard) was becoming more and more indispensable to

the emperor. As the result of intrigue whose details cannot be recovered,

Agrippina and her oldest son were exiled by 29. By 30, her second son had

been arrested. By 33 all, (including Sejanus) were dead. It was Germanicus'

early death that generated the nasty politics of these years. <a href="#N_26_"><b>[[26]]</b></a></p>



<p>The next two emperors, <a href="gaius.html"><b>Caligula</b></a> (37-41) and <a href="claudius.html"><b>Claudius</b></a> (41-54), Germanicus'

son and brother respectively, used him as a surrogate with the legions

where personal loyalty to a commander was paramount, evoking his name

relentlessly in order to trade on his still glowing reputation. They had

become emperor only because they belonged to the imperial family; <a href="auggie.html"><b>Augustus</b></a>

and <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>, on the other hand, had military accomplishments that earned

them the title <i>imperator</i> legitimately. Germanicus was the 'dynastic

lynch-pin' between the Julian and Claudian branches of the family, <a href="#N_27_"><b>[[27]]</b></a> and

<a href="claudius.html"><b>Claudius</b></a> especially needed him for a closer connection with <a href="auggie.html"><b>Augustus</b></a>. And

even thirty years after his death,<a href="nero.html"><b> Nero's</b></a> direct descent (his mother

Agrippina the Younger was Germanicus' daughter) was still an asset.</p>



<p>What would a  principate of Germanicus have been like? There is no way to know,

although there was not much promise in his ineffectual responses during the

mutiny on the Rhine or his strangely conceived trip to Egypt. Some, perhaps

most, of the adulation accorded him when he was alive was reaction to the

unresponsive <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>. Much more came from the fact that he had the good

fortune to die young and permit legend to take over. If he had succeeded

<a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>, he would have been the first of the Julio-Claudian princes reared

to the purple to put on the mantle of the principate. As it turned out, the

opportunity was given <a href="gaius.html"><b>Caligula</b></a>.

<h3>Footnotes</h3>



<p><a name="N_1_"></a>[[1]] The sources for the life and career of Germanicus are primarily

Tacitus, <i>Annals </i> 1-3: Suetonius, <i>Life of Gaius Caligula</i> 1-6; Cassius Dio,

<i>Roman History</i> 56-57. Bronze tablets that record decrees the followed his

death are the <i>Tabula Hebana</i> (Oliver and Palmer (1954), the <i>Tabula

Siarensis</i> (Gonz lez (1984) and the <i>Senatus Consultum de Cn. Pisone Patre</i>

(Eck, Caballos and Fern ndez (1996).</p>



<p><a name="N_2_"></a>[[2]] His date of birth is calculated from the time of his advancement

(Sumner [1967] 421-3). For his birth name, Simpson (1981) 368. For the

cognomen Germanicus in the family, Suet, <i>Cl</i>. 1.3; Dio 55.2.3.</p>



<p><a name="N_3_"></a>[[3]] Tiberius Claudius Nero (the future emperor) became Tiberius Julius

Caesar. Agrippa Postumus became Agrippa Julius Caear. Tiberius' son became

Drusus Julius Caesar.</p>



<p><a name="N_4_"></a>[[4]] The adoptions: Tac. <i>Ann</i>. 1.3; Suet. <i>Aug</i>. 64.1, 65.1; <i>Tib</i>. 15.2, <i>Calig.</i>

<p><a name="N_6_"></a>[[6]] Germanicus' early career: Suet. <i>Calig</i>, 1.1; 8.3; Dio 55.26.1, 31-33.3;

56.11-17, 23.3, 25.2-3; 56.26.1. Sumner (1967) 422-3.</p>



<p><a name="N_7_"></a>[[7]] Agrippa Postumus was killed shortly after Augustus died: Tac. <i>Ann</i>. 1.6;

Suet. <i>Tib</i>. 22; Dio 57.3.5-6. For more detail about his fall and Augustus'

difficulties in establishing a succession, see  Garrett Fagan, <a href="auggie.html"><b><i>Augustus</i></b></a>, <i>De Imperatoribus Romanis</i> (1999).</p>

<p><a name="N_17_"></a>[[17]] It was governed by a prefect of equestrian rank who was responsible

directly to the emperor. Egypt was an important supplier of grain. An

ambitious usurper might seize it and its resources with relative ease and

threaten famine at Rome (Tac. Ann. 2.59).</p>



<p><a name="N_18_"></a>[[18]] Tac. <i>Ann</i>. 2.59-61. Documents and epigraphic evidence corroborate Germanicus'
