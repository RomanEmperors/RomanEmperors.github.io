<div  class="page"><p><span face="Times">As use of the World Wide Web becomes
more prominent within the
archaeological arena, aspects of its

design and implementation come to the
forefront of any discussion 
regarding its
utility. One issue of increasing concern
has been the 
speed at which web pages
and their ancillary files are downloaded -
particularly via analog modem. Because
graphic images take 
considerable time to
download via modem, many web sites
tend to 
include truncated or shrunken
images in an effort to decrease 
page-loading times. This practice results in
web pages that tend to 
compromise their
visual impact as a trade-off for faster
downloading 
times. As a result, the
visual content suffers, and the
archaeological 
concepts become more
difficult to understand.</span></p><p><span face="Times">While extremely useful, such powerful
online 
database solutions typically
require project direction or assistance by
a network administrator. For the more
common archaeology web sites 
(those
typically developed and maintained by
archaeologists with 
limited time and
resources) a more practical approach
with limited 
reliance on external
assistance is needed. Most of these sites
are 
considerably more simplistic, usually
consisting only of HTML files 
and
related images with the occasional video
file. For the production 
of this kind of
material, an understanding of effective
web 
development techniques can assist in
the creation of web resources 
that are
effective and also load quickly.</span></p><div face="Times">
<p>There are a number of tools and
techniques that can be used to 
generate
visually rich web resources that are also
relatively quick 
to load. For instance,
limiting the use of certain HTML tags
and 
implementing specific descriptors for
particular tag attributes can 
markedly
increase the loading time of HTML files.
In addition, 
software has been created to
remove the blank characters in HTML
documents; this can speed up the loading
of such files by 10-15%. But 
by far, the
most significant improvement in
download speed can be 
achieved by
limiting the size of graphical materials
that appear on a 
web page. Fortunately,
specific software applications can
compress the 
graphic file or reduce the
number of colors contained therein and
thus 
reduce the size of the file. Such
software tools and web-design 
techniques
can readily improve the download speed
of web sites to such 
a degree that a
greater abundance of graphic and visual
materials can 
effectively be employed.
For the reasons mentioned above, this
becomes 
a particularly valuable
enterprise when developing
archaeological 
content for delivery via
the World Wide Web.</p>
<h4><span face="Times">Graphic Format Basics</span></h4>
<p>To understand better the underpinnings
of web graphic optimization, 
a basic
understanding of computer graphics in
general is useful. 
Graphics for the web
come in two formats: raster or vector.
GIF, JPEG, 
and Flash files are currently
the most commonly used examples of
these 
two types of computer graphic
formats. </p>
<p>Raster graphics (also 
referred to as
bitmap graphics) are made up of a series
of pixels. 
Each pixel requires a set
amount of memory. Thus larger images
require 
more memory and possess larger
file sizes. This also means that these

types of images do not scale very well.
As the pixels of the image get 
stretched
and enlarged, jagged edges and distortion
result. The raster 
format is most suitable
for images with drop shadows, soft
edges, 
detailed color shifts, and
continuous tone images. 
(<a href="#W">Weinman,
1999</a>)</p>
<p>Vector graphics, on the other hand, are
not pixel-based. Rather, 
they are formed
by mathematical instruction sets. These
mathematical 
formulae remain the same
regardless of the size of the image. As a

result, vector images scale quite well,
and memory requirements remain 
the
same whether the image is large or small.
The vector format is 
most suitable for
illustrations, line art, type or type-formed
images, 
and 'flat-style' artwork.
(<a href="#W">Weinman, 1999</a>)</p>
<p>Stated more 
simplistically and in terms of
potential archaeological content, 
raster
images are most appropriate for
photographic images on the web.
Illustrations, plans, type, and flat-style
artwork however, are better 
served by the
vector format, or by rasterizing a vector
image into a 
GIF file.</p>
<p>Well-known image editors that generate
raster 
graphics include Photoshop,
DeBabelizer, and Paint Shop Pro.
Common 
applications that generate
vector graphics include Illustrator,
Freehand, and CorelDraw. Fireworks, a
graphic application produced by
Macromedia, is specifically designed to
generate web content and 
contains both
raster and vector image editing tools.
More recently, 
Adobe's newest version
of Photoshop has also added support for
vector 
images.</p>
<h4><span face="Times">Graphic File Types for the Web</span></h4>
<p>There are three dominant files types for
web graphics: GIF, JPEG, 
and Flash
files. These types of files make up the
majority of images 
displayed by WWW
browsers such as Internet Explorer or
Netscape. 
Certainly these are the file
types that any developer of

archaeological content would employ for
the display of any graphic 
material.</p>
<p>  <em>GIF Files:</em> The GIF (Graphical
Interchange 
Format) file type is the most
common. (<a href="#T">"Tips" 2000</a>) 
The GIF is a
very 
flexible file type, providing
opportunities for transparency,

interlacing, and limited animations.
Transparency in a GIF image 
allows the
background to remain visible within a
selected area of the 
image. Interlacing
loads a low-resolution version of the
image that 
improves as the rest of file
downloads. Animated GIFs tie a small
series of individual images together to
create a short animation of 
the sort
frequently found on web pages.</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>
For all its flexibility, the GIF format
does have some drawbacks. 
For instance,
a GIF can only contain 256 colors or
less. This makes it 
better suited for
handling graphics with solid colors, but
less 
flexible for continuous tone images.
Thus for archaeological content, 
a GIF
image (or a vector image that has been
rasterized into a GIF) 
would be the file-type employed for site plans, topographic
maps, 
ceramic illustrations, and the like.
(Figure 3)</td>
<td>
<p><span size="-1"><span face="Times"><strong>Figure 3: 
Plan of the Roman Bath at
Isthmia </strong></span></span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>When trying to make GIF files as small
as possible for web 
publication, there are
areas for adjustment: dithering and
lowering 
the bit depth. Dithering
attempts to simulate a missing color from
the 
256-color palette by placing other
pixels that do exist in the 
palette in close
proximity to one another. There are
varying 
techniques for this, which enjoy
varying levels of success. But while
dithering can produce a smoother image
while using fewer colors, it 
will
sometimes result in larger file sizes.</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>One of the most effective ways to reduce
the file size of a GIF 
image is to reduce
the number of colors contained in the file
(also 
referred to as reducing the bit
depth). By reducing the number of 
colors
in the file, for example from 256 (8-bit)
to 64 (6-bit), less 
data needs to be stored
for each pixel, so naturally the file is

smaller. 

<p>Fortunately, there are several commercial

applications that make the task of
experimentation with dithering and 
bit-depth less of a chore. Adobe Photoshop
is one of these. (Figure 
4)</p></td>
<td>
<p><span size="-1"><span face="Times"><strong>Figure 4: 
Save for Web Feature in Adobe
Photoshop 
6.0</strong></span></span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><span face="Times">By selecting 
'Save for Web' from the
File menu in Photoshop, a user can select

varying settings for color depth and
dither, and see the resulting 
visible
changes before saving the file. Such a
tool makes it quite 
easy to consider the
trade-offs between image quality and file
size.</span></p><span face="Times">
<p><em>JPEG Files:</em> Another image file type
prevalent on the web 
is the JPEG or Joint
Photographic Experts Group format. The
JPEG 
format was designed specifically
for digital photographic content, and 
is
best suited for continuous tone graphics.
JPEGs also work well for 
detailed
illustrations, as well as images with
gradients, and the JPEG 
file type is also
designed to effectively represent subtle
shade 
changes. (<a href="#T">"Tips" 2000</a>)
Progressive JPEGs also support
interlacing, as 
with the GIF format.</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>For archaeological images, the JPEG
format is ideally suited for photographic
content. (Figure 5)</td>
<td>
<p><span size="-1"><span face="Times"><strong>Figure 5: 
Photographic Content for the
Web - the Roman Bath at Isthmia</strong></span></span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><span face="Times">For photographic images such as the one
above, 
the JPEG format is a better choice
than GIF. While the image could be

saved as a GIF, it would be difficult to
match all these colors with a 
palette of
256 (the limit of the GIF color palette);
therefore, the 
number of colors present
would require dithering that would most

likely increase the size of the file. Since
the above example also 
contains subtle
shade changes, the JPEG format is the
appropriate 
choice. And the quality of the
image as a GIF would probably not
match 
that of a JPEG, depending upon
the level of JPEG compression.</span></p><span face="Times">
<table><tbody><tr><td>A JPEG image can be compressed at
various levels. This 
is the best 
way of
limiting file sizes for this format. Simply
adjusting the 
quality level while saving
the file in any graphic program will 
result
in greater savings when greater
compression is applied. In 
other words,
the lower the quality of the image, the
lower the file 
size. (Figure 6)</td>
<td>
<p><span size="-1"><span face="Times"><strong>Figure 6: 
Saving JPEG Files</strong></span></span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><span face="Times">As seen in the example above, the image
with a 
quality setting of 12 (the highest),
has a file size of 72.46k and 
will take an
estimated 12.8 seconds to download via
56k modem. 
However the image with a
quality setting of 6 (medium) has a file

size of 19.5k and should download in an
estimated 3.44 seconds via 
56k modem -
a considerable improvement. Of course,
this information 
doesn't take into
account the visible quality of the image.
A small 
file size is of little value if the
picture quality is too poor. 
Usually this
can only be judged by looking at the
images produced. 
(Figure 7)</span></p><span face="Times">



<p><span size="-1"><span face="Times"><strong>Figure 7: 
JPEGS of Highest, Medium,
and Lowest Quality</strong></span></span></p>


</span>
<p><span face="Times">In the 
examples above the difference in
quality is visible. As the quality 
level
decreases, the clouds become less
distinct, considerable detail 
is lost in the
shadows of the building, and the flowers
begin to blend 
together. Usually a quality
level between 6 - 8 provides the best

compromise between image detail and
clarity and limited memory 
requirements.</span></p><span face="Times">

<p>Fortunately, the Save for Web feature in

Photoshop works for the JPEG format as
well as GIF. This provides an 
easy way
to review the visual quality of each
setting before saving 
the JPEG file. Of
course this then results in the best
compromise 
between image quality and
file size.</p>


<p><em>Compression:</em> Although the GIF and
JPEG formats are quite 
different and
have different uses, one item that all file
formats for 
the web have in common is
compression. This compression allows
for the 
small file sizes of GIF and JPEG
(as compared to other graphic file 
types)
that allow for faster transmission via the
web</p>


<p>There are essentially two types of
compression: lossless and lossy. 
Lossless
compression does not remove any data,
and thus the image 
contains the same
data whether compressed or
decompressed. The GIF 
file format
employs a compression scheme called
LZW, which is 
lossless. JPEG on the
other hand employs a lossy compression
scheme. 
With lossy compression, data is
removed from the image; thus it is the
exact opposite of lossless compression.
Therefore, when saving and 
compressing
a JPEG image, data is essentially being
thrown away. For 
this reason, JPEG files
should never be compressed more than
once, 
since each time JPEG compression
is employed, data will be lost.</p>
<p><em>Flash Files:</em> Flash is a software
application developed by 
Macromedia
that generates vector graphics and
animation for the web. 
It is the only well-supported file type for delivering vector
format 
graphic content over the web.</p>
<p>Vector images are usually 
smaller than a
raster version of the image, and provide a
valuable 
tool for web developers. Flash
was created for the delivery of 
online
content, and it is quite a flexible tool. In
addition to the 
development of typical
static images, Flash can be used to create

complex animations and develop
significant interactivity. The 
software
also supports the incorporation of sound
into Flash 
productions. Additionally,
since it is a vector format, Flash is

resolution-independent - it will scale to
the size of any browser, 
with no loss of
quality or functionality.</p>
<p>However, even with all this potential,
there remain several 
drawbacks to thee
Flash platform. The biggest concern is
Flash's 
reliance on browser plug-in
architecture. Although the newest
versions 
of web browsers include native
support for Flash, older browsers 
require
plug-ins. This can be problematic for
some potential users. 
Also, Flash
possesses a significant learning curve
when compared to 
typical graphic
applications. In part, this is the trade-off
for 
increased functionality; however, it
remains a formidable barrier for 
some
developers. This makes it a difficult tool
for archaeologists who
would probably
rather be in the field, lab, or classroom,
than sitting 
in front of the computer.</p>
<h4><span face="Times">Conclusions</span></h4>
<p>Archaeological content delivered via the
Web requires effective 
graphic images.
These images tend to be large and take a
long time to 
download. Rather than
sacrifice the utility of effective graphic

content, images can be modified to
facilitate faster download speeds. 
This
enables the continued use of valuable
visual content in a manner 
that is
effective and timely - a particularly
valuable enterprise for 
archaeological
web sites.</p>
<p>Graphics for the web come in two

formats: raster and vector. Raster images
are pixel-based and thus do 
not scale
very well. Vector images, made of
mathematical instructions 
rather than
pixel data, are resolution-independent,
and scale quite 
well.</p>
<p>GIF and JPEG images are examples of
raster images. 
Through compression,
both of these file-types can generate
smaller 
images suitable for the web. GIF
uses a lossless compression process,

while JPEG employs a lossy compression
scheme. For GIF images, 
lossless
compression means that all the data
remains; however for the 
JPEG image
with lossy compression, data is thrown
out forever when 
compression takes
place.</p>
<p>Considering other factors while 
creating
images can also effectively reduce the
size of GIF and JPEG 
files. Limiting the
number of colors in a GIF image to less
than 256 
reduces the amount of data
stored in the file. Dithering can also help

improve the quality of some images with
reduced color palettes. JPEG 
images can
be sized considerably smaller by reducing
the quality of 
the image. This effectively
throws out more data, and reduces the
size 
of the file. This data cannot be
recovered later however, and JPEG

should not be compressed repeatedly or
the image will degrade beyond 
repair.</p>
<p>Flash files are of a vector format
designed 
specifically for online content.
As such the files are typically 
smaller
than raster images, and also provide
great flexibility, 
particularly for
animations and interactive projects.
There are 
several drawbacks to this
format though, including the reliance
upon 
browser plug-in architecture in
some cases, and its considerable 
learning
curve.</p>
<p>Clearly, there are several paths to more

effective archaeological web site
development through more effective
image production. By reducing the size
of important visual materials, 
the
materials remain useful and effective.
Such activity will improve 
the quality and
functionality of web sites delivering
archaeological 
content, which is an
valuable endeavor overall and furthers
the work 
of the discipline.</p>
