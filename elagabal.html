Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, the "last of the Antonines," is better known to



history as Elagabalus, the name of the sun-god of the Syrian city of



Emesa. Elagabalus the emperor was a high-priest of this deity, and his



active promotion of the god was among several actions that made him an



object of scorn and ridicule among the Roman aristocracy.<p>



The emperor was born with the names Varius Avitus Bassianus sometime



between the autumn of 203 and the spring of 204. His mother, Julia



Soaemias, was a niece of the emperor <a href="sepsev.html"><b>Septimius Severus'</b></a> wife Julia Domna.



As a child this future emperor seems to have been raised in the company of



his great-aunt the empress, spending his earliest years in Rome and



traveling (around the age of 5) with the imperial court to Britain during



<a href="sepsev.html"><b>Severus'</b></a> campaigns on the island. Elagabalus' family became even more



prominent after <a href="sepsev.html"><b>Severus'</b></a> death and <a href="geta.html"><b>Geta's</b></a> murder, with the boy's father



and maternal grandfather each holding important offices during the reign



of <a href="caracala.html"><b>Caracalla</b></a>.</p><p>



Both the father and the grandfather were dead by the spring of 217, when



<a href="caracala.html"><b>Caracalla</b></a> was murdered in Syria between campaigns against the Parthians,



and <a href="macrinus.html"><b>Macrinus</b></a> became emperor. Contemporary historians first mention



Elagabalus at this time. He was living in Emesa with his mother in the



household of his grandmother, Julia Maesa, and he was beginning to perform



in the hereditary family role of high-priest at the temple. Leading Syrian



families used the teenager's public displays as high-priest to channel



soldiers' discontent with  <a href="macrinus.html"><b>Macrinus</b></a> into sedition.  A legion camped nearby



went into open revolt on the evening of 15 May 218. The troops proclaimed



the teenager the bastard son and legitimate heir of <a href="caracala.html"><b>Caracalla</b></a>, and they



named him emperor using  <a href="caracala.html"><b>Caracalla's</b></a> official nomenclature, Marcus Aurelius



Antoninus.</p><p>



Within a month all the Roman armies in the East went over to Elagabalus,



and the teenager and his court spent the summer and autumn purging the



supporters of  <a href="macrinus.html"><b>Macrinus</b></a> and preparing to arrive in Rome. Winter was spent



in Nicomedia, and propaganda was sent out promoting the young emperor as a



religious figure who would bring peace and prosperity to the Roman world.



Paintings were displayed showing the emperor dressed as the Emesene



high-priest, and a marriage to Cornelia Paula took place almost



immediately upon the emperor's arrival in Rome in late summer 219. Plans



were also underway for the young, married emperor to preside over a



"marriage of the gods," a marriage involving Elagabalus the sun-god and



the Carthaginian goddess Tanit. Each deity, as was common in Semitic



religions, had a large stone that was the focus of worship. The Elagabalus



stone accompanied the emperor from Syria, while the Tanit stone was being



transported from Africa.</p><p>



This propaganda campaign was doomed to failure. The marriage to Cornelia



Paula proved fruitless and a divorce was arranged. The emperor also became



involved in a series of homosexual crushes, most notably with the



charioteer Hierocles. These favorites were given authority in the



government, offending aristocrats, bureaucrats and troops alike.



Elagabalus' personal style seemed effeminate and inappropriate to his



office. Tales circulated that he spent his evenings pretending to be a



female prostitute and that he wanted to have a vagina surgically implanted



into his body.</p><p>



The most offensive behavior involved his second marriage, arranged in



haste shortly before the "marriage of the gods" ceremony in 220. The



bride, Aquilia Severa, was a Vestal virgin. Perhaps the symbolism of a



priest marrying a priestess seemed irresistable, but the marriage struck



many Romans as sacrilege. Nor was Severa able to produce an heir, and



divorce came the following year.</p><p>



By 221, however, the emperor was finding his actions restricted. An army



revolt forced Elagabalus to remove many of his favorites from office. A



third marriage was arranged to Annia Faustina, a great-granddaughter twice



over of the emperor <a href="marcaur.html"><b>Marcus Aurelius</b></a>.  Elagabalus was also being undermined by his



grandmother, Julia Maesa, who was now promoting the emperor's cousin



<a href="alexsev.html"><b>Alexianus</b></a> as an alternative ruler. Elagabalus unwillingly adopted his



cousin, renamed <a href="alexsev.html"><b>Alexander</b></a>, and proclaimed him Caesar, but the emperor



still hoped for a heir of his blood. The marriage to Annia Faustina



quickly collapsed, and Elagabalus remarried Aquilia Severa, but no



children arrived.</p><p>



The beginning of 222 found the emperor ever more closed in. Elagabalus



could still count on the unqualified support of his mother, Julia



Soaemias, but he increasingly refused to have contact with his



grandmother, with <a href="alexsev.html"><b>Alexander</b></a> or with their advisors. Government was



approaching gridlock as officials were unable to figure out who had



authority. A failed attempt by Elagabalus to get soldiers to kill



Alexander proved the last straw. Elagabalus and his mother were murdered



the evening of 11 March 222. Their bodies were dumped into the Tiber and



their memories condemned. <a href="alexsev.html"><b>Alexander</b></a> was proclaimed emperor but did not



take the name Antoninus, connected as it was with the failed reign of



predecessor.</p><p>



Scholars have often viewed the failure of Elagabalus' reign as a clash of



cultures between "Eastern" (Syrian) and "Western" (Roman), but this



dichotomy is not very useful. The criticisms of the emperor's effeminacy



and sexual behavior mirror those made of earlier emperors (such as <a href="nero.html"><b>Nero</b></a>)



and do not need to be explained through ethnic stereotypes. With regard to



religion, the emperor's promotion of the cult of the Emesene sun-god was



certainly ridiculed by contemporary observers, but this cult was popular



among soldiers and would remain so. Moreover, the cult continued to be



promoted by later emperors of non-Syrian ethnicity, calling the god The



Unconquered Sun (<i>Sol Invictus</i>).</p><p>



Elagabalus is best understood as a teenager who was raised near the luxury



of the imperial court and who then suffered a drastic change of fortune brought about  by the sudden deaths -- probably within one year -- of his



father, his grandfather and his cousin, the emperor  <a href="caracala.html"><b>Caracalla</b></a>. Thrust upon



the throne, Elagabalus lacked the required discipline. For a while, Romans



may well have been amused by his "Merrie Monarch" behavior, but he ended



up offending those he needed to inspire. His reign tragically demonstrated



the difficulties of having a teenage emperor.</p><h3>PRIMARY SOURCES</h3>:<p>
