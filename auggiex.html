  <h3>Introduction and Summary</h3>                                                                             

 <p>Augustus   was  born   Gaius  Octavius   on  23   September  63   B.C.  His

 mother, Atia, was the niece of Julius Caesar; Atia's mother was  Caesar's sister.

 Augustus,  therefore,  as  the   great-nephew  of   Julius  Caesar,   had  family

 connections  to  political  power at  Rome. Unlike  his great-uncle  and adoptive

 father who was  murdered by  a senatorial  conspiracy in  44 B.C.,  Augustus lived a long life,

 having  replaced the  oligarchic rule  of the  Roman Republic  with a

 constitutional  monarchy,  controlled  first  by  the Julio-Claudian  Dynasty (31

 B.C.  --  68  A.D.),  in  which  Augustus  was  followed  by  <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>,  Claudius,

 <a href="gaius.html"><b>Caligula</b></a>,  and  <a href="nero.html"><b>Nero</b></a>,  all  of  whom were  descended from  Augustus or  his wife,

 Livia. </p>                                                                         

    <p> Through  his  gradual  efforts,  and  through the  circumstances of  his era,

 Augustus ruled Rome alone  for nearly  a half-century  (31 B.C.  -- 14  A.D.), and

 he set for all his successors  the institutional  and ideological  foundations of

 the  Roman  Empire.  The  broad  bases  of  his  power   were  the   army,  whose

 loyalty  was  maintained  by  money  and  land-grants  at  retirement,   and <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>pparently   genuine   support   of    many   people,    who   wanted    at   any

 constitutional cost  an end  to the  factional bloodshed  of the  late Republican

 civil wars; the  nobles retained  niches in  the regular  operation of  the still

 prestigious  political  administration  or  in   military  roles,   property  was

 ultimately  secured,  administrative  roles  were  more  easily  filled  by  some

 increased  social  mobility among  the ranks  and classes,  and the  populace (once  fed)

 was  ostensibly   defended  by   the  <i>tribunicia potestas</i>  with   which  Augustus

 legitimized his rule, and which finally  became the  official rubric  under which

 the  state  was  run  for centuries.  The innovative  outcome of  Augustus' rule

 was  the  acquisition  of  sole  power  at Rome  and abroad  by the  assumption of

 traditionally  distributed  powers  found  in  long-standing  Roman magistracies,

 military  commands,  state religious   honors,  patronage,   family  connections,

 and personal influence.                   </p>                                      

 <h3><b>Rise and Acquisition of Powers</b></h3><h3><i>Youth and career to 28 B.C. </i></h3><p>In 51 B.C., at the age of twelve,  Octavian first  appeared publicly  to give

 the funeral oration for his  grandmother, Julia.  In 48  Caesar had  his fifteen-year-old

 great-nephew elected to the priestly college of  the pontifices,  and he

 also  enrolled  him  in  the  hereditary  patrician aristocracy  of Rome:  on his

 mother's  side  Octavian  had  the  patrician  blood  of  the Caesars,  while his

 father's  family,  the Octavii,  were wealthy  townsmen from  Velitrae, southeast

  of Rome,  to which  his father  came only  as an  equestrian banker,  though his

  grandfather  was  a  senator.  After  recovering  from  illness in  46, Octavian

  joined Caesar in  Spain against  the two  sons of  Pompey the  Great, and  in 45

  Octavian was sent to Apollonia  in Epirus  to study  with the  Greek rhetorician

  Apollodorus of  Pergamum, and  to train  with legions  stationed nearby.  In 44,

  only several months after his arrival  in Greece,  Octavian learned  that Julius

  Caesar  had  been  murdered  at  Rome.  Octavian then  arrived back  in southern

  Italy to discover that he had been adopted in Caesar's will as  his  son and

  heir.  From  this  time  Octavian  called  himself   C. Julius Caesar Octavianus,  though   to  avoid

  confusion,  modern scholars customarily refer to him as Octavian before 27 B.C.    </p>          

       <p> A   feud   soon   developed   between   Octavian   and   Antony,  Caesar's

  colleague as  consul, who  intended to  gain hold  of Caesar's  Gallic provinces

  and was luring Caesar's veterans to his side. Octavian raised an army on his own. 

Under the terms of  Caesar's will,

  Octavian was required to pay a  legacy to  the urban  plebs, but  Antony refused

  to  hand  over the  necessary cash  which Caesar's  widow had  given to  him. In

  43  at Mutina  Antony was  defeated by  Octavian with armies  given to

  him by the senate. Octavian was elected consul that year for  the first  time at

  the unusually young age of nineteen; he  had refused  to fight  unless he  got the

  consulship because  he was  convinced that  the senate  would discard  him after

  they had used  him to  get rid  of Antony.  Finally in  43 at  Bononia, Octavian

  made  terms  with  Antony  and  Lepidus, who  had alternately  supported Caesar,

  Antony,  and  the  senate.  Together  the  three  men  formed  the  triumvirate,

  which had been initially granted absolute  powers for  five years.  They ruthlessly  proscribed 120  senators and  many equestrian  

  whose property  and  money  were confiscated to  pay  troops.  In  42 Antony  and Octavian

  defeated  Brutus  and  Cassius,  the  murderers  of  Caesar,  in two  battles at

  Philippi  in  Macedonia; the credit went  to Antony  because Octavian

  was ill during the fighting.  On  the   ostensibly  Republican   side,  only   Sextus  Pompey

  survived  with  a  fleet, and  Domitius Ahenobarbus

  with the fleet of Brutus and Cassius.  </p>                                         

       <p> In the division of  provinces and  duties after  Philippi, Antony  got the

  potential wealth and glory of the East, and Octavian got  the difficult  task of

  settling veterans in Italy by confiscating  property, since  there was  no money

  yet to buy it. He faced protest at  home and  the starvation  of Rome  by Sextus

  Pompey, who was  blockading grain  ships in  Sicily. In  40 Antony married Octavian's sister Octavia.

  In that year at  Perusia Octavian

  fought and defeated  Antony's brother,  Lucius, who  had objected  to Octavian's

   receiving credit  for  settling  troops  in Italy  before Antony  returned from  the East.

  Though  Lucius  was  pardoned,  others  of  Octavian's   enemies  and   the  town

  council of Perusia were executed.   Octavian tried  to win  the support  of Sextus

  Pompey  and his  fleet by  marrying Pompey's  aunt, Scribonia,  in what  was now

  Octavian's  third  and penultimate  match, producing  his only  daughter, Julia.

  Pompey,  however,  sided  with  Antony  who  was vexed  at the  Perusine episode

  and since 42 was  spending winters  in Egypt  with Cleopatra.  In the  autumn of

  40  at  Brundisium,  Octavian  confronted  Antony  and  the  combined  fleets of

  Pompey  and   Ahenobarbus,  but   instead  of   hostilities  they   agreed to a pact; they  declared Antony's  the Greek-speaking

  provinces  east  of  Macedonia,  and  Octavian's  the  Latin-speaking provinces

  west of Illyricum, while Lepidus remained  in Africa,  and Pompey  initially got

  nothing and continued to blockade Italy.   </p>                                     

       <p> Despite concessions  to Pompey,  in 38  war broke  out in  indecisive sea battles  off  Cumae  and  Rhegium  on  the  coast  of  southern  Italy. Octavian

  divorced  Scribonia  and  married  his  last  wife  Livia,  who  brought  to the

  marriage  her  own  sons,  <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>  and  Drusus.  In  38 Octavian  replaced his

  <i>praenomen</i>  Gaius  with <i> Imperator</i>,  the  title  by  which  troops  hailed  their

  leader after  military success  (ultimately <i>Imperator  </i>developed into  the title

  Emperor).  From  this  time  Octavian's  full  title  was  <i>Imperator  Caesar Divi

  Filius</i>, including the reference to him as the son of his  deified father.  In 37

  Octavian built a  new fleet  under the  direction of  his friend  and lieutenant

  Agrippa,  and  he  met  Antony  at Tarentum  to renew  the triumvirate  for five

  more years. In  36 Octavian,  Agrippa, and  Lepidus launched  a triple  attack on

  Sextus  Pompey  in  Sicily,  and  they won  a naval  battle at  Naulochus, after

  which  Pompey  was  killed   in  Egypt,   and  Lepidus   was  ousted   from  the

  triumvirate for trying to take over Sicily. </p>                                    

       <p> In  36  Octavian  received  tribunician  sacrosanctity  for  his  personal

  security  and  as  an  invocation  of  his  father's support  of the  people; he

  circumspectly declined  the title  of <i>pontifex  maximus</i> because  it was  held by

  Lepidus.  Antony  launched  a failed  campaign against  the Parthians,  and when

  his  wife,  Octavia,  attempted  to  bring  supplies  and additional  troops, he

  snubbed  her  and  her  brother  by  sending  her  home.  In 34 Antony   gave  eastern

  provinces to  his children  by Cleopatra,  and Egypt  and Cyprus  to Cleopatra's

  children  by  Caesar; these were the so-called <i>Donations of Alexandria</i>. 

   In  the resulting  propaganda war,  Octavian did  the most

  damage  to  Antony  by  presenting  Cleopatra  and  her  territorial gains  as a

  foreign  menace  to  the  security of  Rome. From  35 to  33 Octavian  fought in

  Illyricum  and Dalmatia,  the eastern  borders of  Italy.  In 33  Agrippa as

  <i>aedile</i> dealt with the precious water supply in Rome and restored aquaducts.    </p>   

        <p alin="left">In 32 the  inhabitants of  Italy and  of many  provinces swore  a personal

  oath of allegiance to Octavian to support  him against  his private  enemies.   By

  this  oath  Octavian  claimed that  the people  were demanding  him as  leader in

  the   now  inevitable   war,  declared   nominally  against   Cleopatra.  Antony

  divorced Octavia.  In 31  Octavian defeated  the combined  forces of  Antony and

  Cleopatra in a naval battle at <a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;actium1.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=473&quot;)"> <b>Actium</b></a> off the coast of Greece. After the suicides

  of  Antony and  Cleopatra in  Egypt, Octavian  annexed Egypt  as a  province. In

  31  Octavian  assumed  the   consulship  at   Rome  for   the  third   time  and

  monopolized it successively through 23.     </p>                                    

       <p> In 29 Octavian celebrated a  triple triumph  at Rome  for his  conquest of

  Illyricum,  for  the  battle  of  Actium,  and  for  the  annexation  of  Egypt.

  Octavian's  now  huge  army of  sixty legions  began to  be demobilized  and was

  shortly  reduced to  twenty-eight. Soldiers  and veterans  were paid  with funds

  now  drawn  from  the  vast wealth  of Egypt.  Despite the  fact that  wars were

  going  on  in Gaul  and Spain,  the temple  of Janus  at Rome  was ceremoniously

  closed, an event that happened  only twice  before in  history, to  signify that

 Rome  was  at  peace  with  the  world.  The  senate  and  people  voted Octavian

  countless   other   honors,   crowns,   games,   commemorative   structures,  and

  additional powers, including his ability  to create  patricians, both  to enlarge

  and to  preserve the  social hierarchy  into which  Julius Caesar  had previously

  introduced Octavian himself. In 28  with Agrippa  as his  colleague in  his sixth

  consulship,  Octavian  held a  census of  the people  and moderately  reduced the

  swollen  ranks  of  the  senate  from  1000  to 800  members,

  of which he was appointed the leading man.    </p>                                   

   <h3><b> 'The Republic Restored':    </b></h3><h3><i>The First Constitutional Settlement of the Principate, 27-24 B.C.</i></h3><p>In  27  Octavian  declared that he had restored  the republic,  a claim  echoed but  also dismissed

  even  among  the  ancients.  Octavian  gave  amnesty to  his former  opponents in

  the  civil  wars.  While  the  senate  and   assemblies  resumed   their  regular

  functions,  Octavian maintained  his hold  on the  consulship, but  elections for

  his  colleague  took  place.  The swollen  ranks of  <i>praetors </i>and  <i>quaestors</i> were

  reduced by half  to the  Sullan numbers  of eight  and twenty,  respectively, and

  all these offices retained  their traditional functions,  including the  consulship and

  praetorship as springboards for provincial commands.        </p>                     

        <p>The  real,  monarchical  hold,  however,  that  Octavian  had on  the state

  was  military.  When   Octavian  announced   his  plans   to  lay   down  supreme

  power,  there  had  been protest  in the  senate, partly  from his  partisans and

  partly perhaps from concern that the state would erupt again  into civil  war. In

  the so-called 'first settlement' of 27, Octavian agreed to accept for ten years a

  provincial   command  which   contained  the   largest  standing   Roman  armies,

  then  stationed in  Spain, Gaul,  and Syria,  the so-called  'imperial provinces.' 

   By the  removal of  senatorial proconsuls

  from  Octavian's  three  major  provinces,  and  with  the  placement   there  of

  subordinate  legates,  Octavian  was  no  longer  threatened  by men  of consular

  rank  with  significant  armies.   The  three   major  senatorial   provinces  of

  Illyricum,  Macedonia and  Africa appeared  to balance  Octavian's grant,  but in

  reality these provinces held  only a few legions. Thus  without appearing

  to force  the senate,  Octavian obtained  sole proconsular  power over  the major

  provincial   armies;   though   this   power   normally   lapsed   at   Rome,  he

  maintained  both  civil  and  military  authority  there through  his consulship.

  Technically  Octavian  used  powers  given  to  him  for  a  fixed period  by the

  senate  and  people  of  Rome,  and  there  were  Republican precedents, albeit abnormal ones, for such

  powers and continuous rule. </p>                               

        <p>Octavian later claimed that in  27 he  had no  more power  than any  of his

  colleagues in any magistracy (<i>Res Gestae</i> 34.3), and he  referred to  himself simply  as <i>princeps</i>,

  the first man among equals  at Rome.  This strictly  unofficial and  broad title,

  not to be  confused with  the narrow  parameters of  the '<i>princeps  senatus</i>', had

  already been applied to individuals in the late Republic,  and for  centuries the

  leading   men   of  Rome   had  been   known  as   '<i>principes  viri'</i>.   Thus  the

  'principate',  as  the  era  is now  designated, suggests  a mere  pre-eminence in

  civil affairs which belies absolute power based ultimately on the army. </p>          

       <p> The official title decreed to Octavian by the senate  in 27  was <i>Augustus</i>,

  the  name  by  which  he is  most widely  known, making  his full  title <i>Imperator

  Caesar  Divi  Filius  Augustus.</i>   He  considered   adopting  the   name  'Romulus'

  and the  association it  would have  for him  as the  refounder of  Rome.

  Because  Romulus,  however,  also  had  the  contemporary  discredit of  both overt

  monarchy  and  fratricide,  Augustus preferred  the association  of his  new title

  with religious awe: holy things, for  instance, were  called <i>augusta</i>.  The title

  was  traditionally  linked  by  etymology  with   <i>augere</i>,  'to   increase';  the

  adjective  was  juxtaposed  with  the  religious  practice  of augury  in Ennius's

  well-known  description  of  Romulus's  founding   of  Rome   <i>augusto  augurio</i>.

  The  title <i> Augustus</i> was  subsequently  held  by  all  Roman   emperors  except

  Vitellius, and <i>Augusta</i> was used to address the wife of the reigning emperor, or his mother.</p>

      <p>  After 27 Augustus maintained that  he excelled  all his  equals only  in his

 <i> auctoritas.</i>  This  term,  also  etymologically  connected  with  <i>augustus</i>, had

  no   constitutional   meaning   and   implied  no   legal  powers;   it  signified

  Augustus's   moral  authority   and  increased   prestige  which   guaranteed  the

  good  of  the  order  in  Rome. <i>Auctoritas</i>  was personal  power which  rested on

  the  loyalty  of  people  who,  as  clients of  Augustus, recognized  his military

  conquest  and  his  achievement  of  political  stability  for  the  commonwealth.

  This type  of power  was seen  previously in  the personal  oath of  allegiance of

  32, and it did not depend on the immediate constitutional settlement. </p>            

       <p> In  27  Augustus  ultimately  and  perhaps  wisely   freed  Rome   from  his

  presence  to  visit  the western  provinces of  Gaul and  Spain. When  he returned

  to  Rome  in  24,  he  became  <i>consul </i> for  the  tenth  time  with   one  Norbanus

  Flaccus,  who  had  supported  both  Sextus  Pompey  and   Antony  in   the  civil

  wars.  Despite  an  indecisive  outcome  in  the  Spanish  war, honors  were voted

  by  the  senate  to Augustus's  relatives who  participated. Augustus  himself was

  ill and facing a conspiracy against his life.  </p>                                   

    <h3><i>The Second Settlement and the Evolution of the Principate,  23 -- 16 B.C. </i></h3><p>In  Augustus's  absence  from  Rome,  dissatisfaction  with  the  new regime

  had apparently resulted  in  a  conspiracy  by  his  colleague in  the consulship,  Varro Murena,

  and  a  Republican,  Fannius  Caepio,  both  of  whom  were  brought to  trial and

  executed.  Though  Augustus  veiled  monarchic  power  more  than   Julius  Caesar

  did, Augustus's unending series  of consulships  was a  thorn in  the side  of the

  senatorial  class,  which  was  prevented  yearly  from  competing  for one  of the

  two seats  of the  supreme magistracy.  In 23  Augustus abdicated  the consulship,

  and  in  so doing,  he made  room for  more nobles,  relieved himself  of consular

  duties,   and   increased   the   number   of   former   consuls   available   for

  administrative  work.  He  held  the  consulship  again on  only two  occasions, 5

  and 2 B.C., to introduce his grandsons to public life; he held this office a total  of thirteen times, nine of them consecutively from 31-23.</p>                         

 <p>Without  the  consulship  Augustus  lacked  legitimate  civil  and  military

  authority  at  Rome.  Accordingly  in  23,  he was  awarded the <i>tribunicia potestas</i> for

  life. With this grant, Augustus regained the initiative  to bring  legislation and

  motions before the senate; he got the  right of  putting the  first motion  in any

  meeting of the senate, despite the fact that the seniority of the actual tribunate

  was  very  low;  he  technically had  the right  to the  tribunician veto,  but he

  probably  never  had  to  use  it,  because  he  would  already  have  approved of

  motions  before  they  reached  the  senate;  he got  magisterial power  to compel

  citizens  to  obey his  orders; he  got the  power to  help citizens  oppressed by

  other  magistrates  (and  he  had already  been granted  tribunician sacrosanctity

  for  his  personal  protection  in 36).  Augustus did  not need  any of  these new

  powers  themselves,  but  rather  the  legitimacy  they  provided.  It   was  also

  convenient  that  tribunician  power  was traditionally  invoked in  protection of

  the  common  people.   To advertise  this association  with the  people, Augustus

  set the official beginning of  his reign  at the  assumption of  tribunician power

  in  23;  traditionally  years  had  been  numbered by  the annual  consulship, but

  now  they  were  counted  by  the  successive  tenure  of  tribunician   power,  a

  practice which continued throughout the Imperial period.  </p>                        

       <p> Without  the  consulship,  Augustus  technically  did  not  any  longer have

  military  power  in  Rome, but  only in  his own  provinces. The  senate therefore

  enlarged  his  proconsular <i> imperium </i> so  that it  did not  lapse when  he entered

  the  boundaries  of  the city;  more importantly,  since the  consuls at  Rome had

  more  power  than  any  one  abroad  and  could   command  any   army,  Augustus's

  military  power  was  officially  declared greater  than any  proconsul's, reducing

  them  all  to his  legates, with  what was  called '<i>maius  imperium proconsulare</i>'.

  Greater  military  power  and  tribunician  power  were  thus  for   Augustus  the

  legitimate   bases  of   rule,  and   they  remained   so  throughout   the  duration of the  Empire.</p>                                                                           

       <p> Perhaps  Augustus's  illness in  23 forced  him to  provide for  the control

  of  the  armies  abroad  by  having  the  senate  grant Agrippa  proconsular <i>imperium</i>

  for five years;  Agrippa then  got an  eastern command.  In 22  riots broke  out at

  Rome,  when  flood,  disease  and  famine  were  attributed   to  the   fact  that

  Augustus  had  withdrawn   from  the   consulship  and   apparently  was   not  in

  charge.  Augustus  refused  to  take  the  office  of <i> dictator</i>,  which   was  too

  politically  charged  with  envy and  hatred, and  he also  refused to  accept the

  censorship  for  life and  its traditionally  despised power  to expel  members of

  the senate arbitrarily.  He did,  however, assume  the care  of the  grain supply,

  which he quickly repaired, and then he left for Sicily, Greece, and Asia.   </p>      

       <p> After  Augustus  left  Rome, there  was disorder  at the  consular elections

  of  22,  with  only  one consul  elected when  Augustus refused  to stand  for the

  office; the next year there was a similar  crisis. Augustus  refused to  return to

  Rome during all the trouble. To help  elect the  consuls and  to restore  order he

  sent  Agrippa,  who  in  21 married  Augustus's daughter,  Julia, then  widowed by

  the death  of Marcellus  two years  earlier. In  19 Augustus  was again  begged to

  take  the  consulship,  which  he  refused,  and  was  summoned  to  Rome  because

  of  more  unrest;  the  day he  finally arrived  was declared  a holiday  by the

  senate,  and  an  altar  was  dedicated  to  Fortune the  Homebringer. In  19 he

  accepted  consular power  for life,  the right  to sit  between the  two elected

  consuls, to bear the fasces as symbols of power,  and to  be attended  by twelve

  lictors.  Though  Augustus did  not need  consular power,  the visibility  of it

  appeared to quell  the agitation  of the  people. He  also accepted  a five-year

  appointment  as  supervisor  of  morals  with  censorial powers.  By 19  he held

  not the invidious offices but the  actual powers  of the  consulship, tribunate,

  censorship; effectively, he also held  the military dictatorship.   </p>                       

       <p> In  18  the  powers of  the principate  were renewed  for five  more years

  through  the  extension  of the  proconsular power  which was  initially granted

  to  Augustus for  ten years  at the  first consitutional  settlement of  27. Now

  Augustus  made  Agrippa  virtually  co-regent  through  the renewal  award   of   proconsular  power, and the award of tribunician power.

  In 18  Augustus used  his censorial

  power  to  reduce  the  ranks  of the  senate again  from eight-hundred  to six-

  hundred members (the three such  senatorial reforms  took place  in 29,  18, and

  11). By the authority of his tribunician power, he passed the Julian Laws  of 18

  for  moral  reform  and  the  criminal  code.  The  new  laws  were  intended to

  mitigate  the  social  and  civil  disorder  caused  by  the  cynicism  of  late

  Republican anarchy, and to encourage  long-term stability  for the  state. There

  were  laws  against  adultery  and  promoting  marriage  and  childbirth  by the

  grant  of special  privileges or  penalties, laws  against luxury  and electoral

  corruption, and appellate  laws superceding  public jury-verdicts  ultimately to

  the jurisdiction of Augustus himself.</p>                                           

  <h3><i> Remaining years of the Principate and Succession, 17  B.C. -- 14 A.D. </i></h3><p>To mark  the new  age of  Augustus in  17, he  and Agrippa  celebrated the

  solemn  sacrifices  at  the time-honored  Secular Games.  In succession plans that  year, Augustus

  adopted  his grandsons,  Gaius and  Lucius, sons  of Agrippa  and Julia.   From  16  to  13  Augustus

  was  abroad organizing  Gaul, and  Agrippa was

  in  Asia.  In  15  Augustus  established  the  Imperial  mint  at  Lugdunum; the

  senate,  which  traditionally  controlled  coinage,  continued to  produce money

  in  bronze,  while  Augustus  obtained  direct  control  over  gold  and  silver

  coinage with the mint at Lugdunum in the  west and  at Antioch  in the  east. In

  13  Augustus  and   Agrippa  returned   to  Rome,   and  their   provinces  were

  renewed for five more years, as was Agrippa's tribunician  power; later  in that

  year  Agrippa  died,  leaving  Augustus  without  his  long-trusted  friend, who

  was  buried  with  lavish  honors  in Augustus's  mausoleum on  the bank  of the

  Tiber  river.  After  Agrippa's  death,  Julia  bore  their  third  son, Agrippa

  Postumus.  <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>  had to  divorce his  wife, Vipsania,  to marry  the widowed

  Julia. In 13 the former triumvir, Lepidus, also died, leaving open the life-long

  office  of  the  high  priest  of  Roman state-religion;  in 12  Augustus became

  <i>pontifex  maximus</i>.  Augustus's  power  as  supervisor  of  morals   was  renewed

  for five more years. He reformed the senate for the third time, and he set up a

  permanent  commission  for  the  care  of  the  water  supply,  which  had been

  Agrippa's   domain.   <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>   and   Drusus   campaigned   in   Germany   and

  Dalmatia,  and  in  9  Drusus  died.  In  8  Augustus's  proconsular  power was

  renewed for a third time for ten years; a census was  held, the  month Sextilis

  was renamed August, and Rome was divided into fourteen regions.</p>.                    

       <p> In 6 <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> was given tribunician power for  life and  was sent  to the

  east to settle the throne in Armenia.  In 5  and 2  Augustus again  assumed the

  consulship only to introduce his grandsons, Gaius and  Lucius, to  public life,

  with their ceremonial assumption of the  <i>toga virilis</i>.  At the  designation of

  Gaius in 5 as<i> princeps iuventutis</i> and  so as  apparent sucessor  of Augustus,

  <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> settled at Rhodes for eight years in so-called <i>retirement</i>, which may

  have  been  used  to  gain  support in  the east  for his  own succession.  In 2  B. C.

  Augustus  received  the  purely  honorific  title  <i>pater  patriae</i>,  with  the

  associations of the power and prestigious influence of a father over  the state

  family.  His titles included<i>Imperator Caesar Divi Filius Augustus Pontifex Maximus, Pater Patriae.</i> All of his titles

 were republican, including <i>Imperator.</i>

His  military  proconsular power  was never

  given prominence in his official appellation; Trajan was  the first  emperor to

  use the title <i>proconsul,</i> and only when he was not in Italy.            </p>          

       <p> In  2  Gaius was  dispatched from  Rome to  negotiate with  the Parthians

  in  the  east. In  this year  Augustus was  compelled to  banish from  Rome his

  own daughter, Julia, for her scandalous  personal behavior,  which was  a great

  embarrassment to her father's legislative efforts at moral reform. With Julia's

  departure  and  divorce  from  <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>,  Augustus  had  to  make  his dynastic

  plans without the  hope of  any more  male grandchildren,  the supply  of which

  dwindled to  only Agrippa  Postumus, when  Lucius and  Gaius died,  in 2  and 4

  A.D.,  respectively.  In  2  A.D. <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>  was recalled  from Rhodes  to Rome,

  perhaps  because  eastern  support  for his  succession had  surpassed Gaius';

  <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>'  consular  <i>imperium </i> and  tribunician power  had run  out in  1 B.C.

  and  had  not  been  renewed. In  4 A.D.,  after the  death of  Gaius, Augustus

  adopted  <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>  and  Agrippa  Postumus. Though  Augustus preferred  a Julian

  heir to the Claudian <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>, Augustus disliked the  wild behavior  of Agrippa

  Postumus  and  exiled  him  three  years  after  his  adoption.  <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>,  now

  adopted  into  the  Julian  line,  was forced  to enlarge  the line  further by

  adopting,  in  dynastic  preference  to  his  own son  by Vipsania,  his nephew

  Germanicus;  his  mother  was  the  daughter  of  Augustus's  sister,   and Germanicus 

married Augustus's granddaughter, Agrippina.           </p>                    

      <p>  From  4  to 11  Augustus employed  <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> in  campaigns in  the Balkans

  and Germany.  In 6  Augustus established  the <i>aerarium  militare</i> as  a public

  treasury  to  pay  soldiers;  though  he made  the initial  grant from  his own

  money,  thereafter the  treasury was  maintained by  new sales  and inheritance

  taxes, with the result that  donations to  retired soldiers  did not  appear to

  depend  on  the  emperor. A  new fire  brigade and  nocturnal police  force was

  also  established, in  seven cohorts  of one-thousand  freedmen each,  with two

  cohorts for each of the fourteen regions of the city. In 12 <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> celebrated a

  triumph for Dalmatia and Pannonia, and Germanicus held the consulship.   </p>        

       <p> In  13  <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>  was  again  granted  proconsular  imperium   and  tribunician

  power.  In  14  he conducted  a census  with Augustus  and then  left Rome  for a

  command  in  Illyricum.  Augustus  died  on  19  August  A.D.  14  at  Nola.  The

  armies were loyal to <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>, and he had the tribunician right of  initiative at

  Rome.  This  hereditary  system  of  succession was  established by  Augustus for

  centuries. </p>                                                                      

      <h3><b> The Empire </b></h3><h3><i>Territorial Acquisitions</i></h3><p>Political  power  at  Rome  had   always  been   won  through   the  force,

  prestige,  and  wealth  of conquest;  Augustus' armies  conquered more

  lands than any of his  Roman predecessors  or successors.  After the  death of

  Cleopatra in 30, Egypt  was the  first major  gain by  Augustus, with  the wealth

  and  flourishing   cities  of   the  Ptolemies,   and  Egyptian   grain.  Exposed

  geographically  only  in  the  south,  the  province  was  advanced to  the First

  Cataract by  the prefect  Cornelius Gallus;  in 25  there was  another successful

  expedition  against  raids  by  the  Ethiopians.  Although Augustus,  through his

  legate, failed to conquer Arabia  Felix, the  Red Sea  was secured  and sea-trade

  with India was ultimately established.  In 27  Augustus visited  Gaul and  held a

  census there for the purpose of fairer taxation, and in 26-25 he fought a  war in

  Spain,  which  Agrippa  finally  concluded in  19, with  the pacification  of the

  province.  While  Augustus  was  in  Spain,  Varro  Murena defeated  the Salassi,

  who  were  raiding  Cisalpine  Gaul  from  Aosta  in  the  western  Alps.  In  25

  Augustus  settled  Juba as  the king  of Mauretania  in Africa,  another province

  valuable for the grain supply to Rome. </p>                                          

        <p>In  25  in  Asia  Minor,  Galatia  was  annexed,  and Augustus  founded the

  colony  of  Caesarea  at  Antioch.  The  main  problem  in  the east  was Parthia,

  which  could  unsettle  Roman  control  in   neighboring  Armenia,   and  further

  west into Galatia. In 30  Augustus refrained  from a  draining war  with Phraates

  of Parthia, by refusing to abet a pretender to the Parthian throne, by setting up

  a  client-king  in  Armenia  minor,  and  by  holding  the  brothers  of  Armenian

  king Artaxes as hostages  to Armenia's  good behavior  as a  buffer state  in the

  area.  Ten  years  later,  after  the  watchful  regency  of Agrippa  from 23-21,

  Augustus  reached  a diplomatic  settlement with  Parthia for  the return  of the

  Roman  standards  captured  from Crassus  in 53  B.C., for  the stability  of the

  Parthian  kingdom  in   the  region,   and  for   Parthian  agreement   to  Roman

  control  in  Armenia;  Parthia  acquiesced  under  only  the  threat  of combined

  military  force  from  Augustus  in  Syria  and <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>  in Armenia.  From 16-13

  Agrippa  was  back  in  the  east  settling  the  Bosporan  kingdom,   which  was

  economically  important  as  the  main source  of food  from southern  Russia for

  cities of northern Asia Minor  and the  Aegean, as  well as  for Roman  troops on

  the eastern frontier; despite a later  shift in  local control,  Roman hegemony

  was established.     </p>                                                           

       <p> In  15  <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a>  and Drusus  completed the  pacification of  the northern

  Alpine  frontier,  begun  in  25  when  T. Varro  wiped out  the Salassi  on the

  western side. Now on the eastern side of the  Alps, the  frontier was  pushed up

  to  the  Danube  river,  including  Raetia  and  Noricum.  With   Alpine  passes

  open,  Cisalpine  and  Transalpine  Gaul  became  more  united  and  prosperous;

  the  raids  of the  Alpine tribes  of Italy  were over,  and Roman  armies could

  more  easily  get  to  central  Gaul  and  the  Rhine.  From  13-9  the northern

  frontier was further strengthened near  Illyricum by  the conquest  of Pannonia.

  Roman  control  thus  stretched  from  the  Adriatic  to  the Danube,  making an

  overland  route  from  Rome  to  Illyricum through  the eastermost  Julian Alps,

  and connecting Macedonia  to Italy  and Gaul.  After an  uprising in  Thrace was

  quelled from 11-9, the  Romans were  in control  of the  territory south  of the

  entire length of  the Danube  to the  Black Sea.  At the  northernmost frontier,

  Drusus  campaigned  in  Germany  from  12-9  and   tried  to   advance  Caesar's

  German  frontier  of the  Rhine as  far as  the Elbe,  but he  accomplished only

  raids between the two rivers. </p>                                                  

        <p>On  the  eastern  frontier, the  Parthians and  Armenians were  in dispute

  again,  and  in  2  B.C. Augustus  sent his  grandson Gaius  there, in  what was

  already a successfully negotiated end to the  trouble. Since  37 Judea  had been

  controlled by Herod the Great as a friend  of Augustus;  Judea was  finally made

  into a Roman province in 6 A.D.,  when at  the request  of the  Jews, Archelaus,

  the son of Herod, was driven out.     </p>                                          

        <p>In 5 A.D. on the  northern frontier  <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> reached  the Elbe,  and then

  tried to subdue the  Marcomanni, so  that by  linking the  Elbe with  the Danube

  a new frontier could be established all the way  to the  Black Sea.  His efforts

  were interrupted  and never  resumed.  In 6  there was  a great  and bloody

  revolt  in  Pannonia  and  Dalmatia, which  <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> finally  crushed in  7-8 in

  Pannonia,  and  in  9 in  Dalmatia. Though  <a href="tiberius.html"><b>Tiberius</b></a> did  return to  Germany, he

  and  Germanicus  were  occupied  in  defending   the  Rhine   after  Quinctilius

  Varus  suffered  a disastrous  defeat there at the <a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;teutob1.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=471&quot;)"> <b>Battle of the Teutoburg Forest</b></a>,  losing three  legions and  all the

  territory east of the river. Despite the recovery of the river and forays beyond

  it, Augustus gave up the thought of a frontier beyond the Rhine.</p>   

  <h3><i> Imperial Policy and Ideology</i></h3><p>In  his  relationship with  the armies  as well  as with  the provincials,

  Augustus operated as a patron to clients. He was  the only  patron of  the client

  army,  which  he  controlled  with land  or money,  often out  of his  own great

  wealth;  he  gave  to  his successors  an army  accustomed to  dynastic loyalty.

  Similarly in the  provinces, local  client-kings and  magistrates who  were loyal

  to  Augustus  created  relative  stability  for  an  empire whose  allegiance no

  longer shifted  to the  latest victor  in Roman  civil wars,  but rested  on the

  dynasty of the principate.      </p>                                                

  <p>While  an  overseas  empire   demanded  a   standing  army   instead  of

  simply  an  emergency  force,  Augustus  still  did  not  have  an  integrated

  imperial  policy  of  either  defense  or  expansion. Military  campaigns were

  conducted pragmatically for the protection of frontiers, the assurance  of the

  food supply, or the reaction  to rebellion.  Augustus, however,  exploited the

  appearance of aggressive conquest, taking military credit even  for diplomatic

  gains like  Parthia, and  granting decisive  honors for  family who  were only

  minimally successful, or who had to return subsequently to quell rebellion.</p>

        <p>The ideology of the  <i>Pax Augusta</i>  referred to  the condition  of those

  who had been subdued; peace  was born  of broad  imperial conquest,  which did

  not imply any limits or a  governing policy  of pacifism.  Similarly, conquest

  or  colonization  by  Augustus  did  not  have  an ideological and

  policy goal of Romanization. The primary purpose  of colonization  of pacified

  regions was military control through the grant of land to soldiers  who formed

  garrison-colonies, and these colonies had the effect  of encouraging  trade in

  the  provinces.  In  the  west,  the  adoption of  Roman customs  and language

  took place spontaneously  in the  relative cultural  void, which  absorbed the

  Roman pattern of urbanization; in the east  the sophisticated  native cultures

  were not Romanized, nor did Augustus intend them to be.  </p>                     

    <h3><i> State Religion, and Imperial Image and Building </i></h3><p>Roman religion consisted of cult ritual,  whose regular  and traditional

  performance had a cohesive role in the state. The prestige of religious things

  had been dampened  by neglect  during the  civil war  years, but  now religion

  was restored and promoted by Augustus for stability and  for his  own position

  in the state. Julius Caesar had traced the  divine ancestry  of his  family to

  Venus and Mars, and when he was deified in  42, Augustus  early in  his career

  became the son of a god; in 29 he dedicated the Temple of the Divine Julius in

  the  Roman Forum.  Augustus's defeat  of Antony  and Cleopatra  was portrayed as a

  victory of Roman  over Egyptian  gods; in  28 Augustus  dedicated a  temple to

  'Actian  Apollo'  on  Rome's  Palatine  Hill,  where  Augustus  himself lived.

  Apollo was represented in a  cult statue  and in  reliefs as  both the  god of

  vengeance against sacrilege like  Antony's, and  also as  a bringer  of peace.

  Augustus undertook the restoration  of existing  temples in  the city,  and he

  claims to have rebuilt eighty-two. (<i>Res Gestae</i>, 20.4)       </p>                                      

      <p>  After  Actium  Augustus was  venerated as  a divine  king in  Egypt, and

  the provinces in the east were allowed to erect temples to him  in association

  with  the  goddess  Roma. At  Rome the  senate made  the traditional  vows and

  prayers for his safety, and included him in annual prayers at the  beginning of

  the year; even  at Rome,  however, the  process of  divination was  begun. His

  name was included in the ancient Salian hymn to  Mars or  Quirinus. In  27 the

  cult of the Genius of Augustus was established, in which it was decreed that a

  libation  should  be  poured  to  his  guardian spirit  at public  and private

  banquets. The senate authorized a tribute to his  moral leadership  by setting

  up  in  the  senate-house  a  golden shield  celebrating his  military virtue,

  clemency,  justice,  and  social  and religious  responsibility; this  shield was

  associated  with  the  goddess  Victoria  and  therefore implied  god-given rule.

  Laurel trees sacred to Apollo were  set up  on either  side of  Augustus's house,

  and  for  rescuing  citizens  he  was  awarded  the  <i>corona  civica</i>, made  of oak

  leaves from the tree sacred to Jupiter. On coins of the period Jupiter's eagle, a

  symbol of apotheosis, was depicted with the civic crown and laurel branches. </p>    

        <p>In  27  in  the  Campus  Martius  Agrippa  built the  Pantheon, but  he was

  not  allowed  to  fashion  it  as an  overt 'Augusteum';  instead the  temple was

  dedicated  to  the  divine  ancestry  of  Augustus through  Venus, Mars,  and the

  deified  Julius.  In  25-24  work  began  on  the  Temple  of  Mars  Ultor, which

  Augustus had  vowed  at  the  battle  of  Philippi  in  vengeance  for  his  father's

  murder,  and  which  later  housed the  standards returned  by the  Parthians. In

  22  the  temple  of  Juppiter  Tonans  was  dedicated on  the Capitoline  Hill by

  Augustus  who  had  escaped  being  struck  by  lightning  during   the  Spanish

  campaign.  After  20  the  Prima  Porta  Augustus was  commissioned, a  statue of

  the  emperor  on  whose  cuirass  is  depicted  the  return  of the  standards by

  Parthia, in the presence of Mars, Apollo, and Venus. </p>                            

        <p>In  17  Augustus  celebrated  the  Secular  Games  which  marked  the close

  of a <i>saeculum </i>or epoch  of a  human life-span,  defined in  the Republic  at one-

  hundred  years,  but  celebrated  elastically in  Augustus's day  at one-hundred-

  and-ten.  In  the new  spirit of  prosperity, the  traditional deities  of dread,

  including  warlike  Mars,  and  underworld  Pluto  and  Persephone,  were absent;

  sacrifices were made  in honor  of the  Fates, the  goddess of  childbirth, Earth

  Mother,  Jupiter  and  Juno,  and  Apollo  and  Diana.  The  poet   Horace was

  commissioned  to  write  a  hymn  which  was  sung   by  twenty-seven   boys  and

  twenty-seven girls. </p>                                                             

       <p> In  13  at  the  return  of  Augustus  from  Spain  and  Gaul,  the  senate

  decreed the <i>Ara Pacis</i> to  be built  near the  Campus Martius.  This altar

  was to be used by magistrates and priests for annual  sacrifices. Reliefs  on the

  altar depict the symbols and  fruits of  peace in  juxtaposition with  figures of

  war   by   which   peace   was   gained,  and   there  are   processions  perhaps

  representing   the   major   priesthoods   in   Rome,   with   Augustus   himself

  portrayed in  religious attire.  Near this  altar was  a sundial  associated with

  Augustus's  patron,  the  sun-god  Apollo.  In  12  in  the  western  province of

  Gaul, Drusus set up an altar at Lugdunum dedicated to Roma and Augustus. </p>        

       <p> After  Actium,  when  Augustus  was  given  the   power  of   creating  new

  patricians,  the  supply  of   men  for   priesthoods  was   increased.  Augustus

  himself  became  a  member  of  the  <i>Fratres Arvales</i>,  an elite  fraternity which

  performed  time-honored,  public  sacrifices  for  the  prosperity of  the state-

  family. In  12 Augustus  became <i>pontifex  maximus</i>; in  11, a  new high  priest of

  Jupiter,  the  <i>flamen  dialis</i>,  was appointed.  When Augustus  in 8  divided Rome

  into  fourteen  regions,  the  humble  worship  by the  poor of  the gods  of the

  crossroads, the<i> Lares Compitales</i>, was elevated to official stature;  this worship

  was  promoted  throughout  the  regions  of  Rome and  Italy in  association with

  the  worship  of the  genius of  Augustus. At  this time  the genius  of Augustus

  was probably included in official oaths.</p>                                          

<p>Less than one month after his death in 14 A.D., divine honors were           

 decreed to Augustus at Rome,  and the  precedent was  set there  for the           

 posthumous deification of successive emperors.</p>.                                     

    <h3> Assessment    </h3><p>There  was  not  a  dyarchic  division  of  power  between  the   senate  and

 Augustus.  Augustus  ultimately  had the  power of  all the  legions abroad  and of

 the  standing  army  of  9,000  soldiers  in the  Praetorian Guard  at Rome

 and  in  the   Italian  towns.   The  senate,   however,  had   important  judicial,

 financial,  and  probouleutic  functions  at  home,  and  it  was  the   source  of

 provincial  governorships.  The  basic  social  hierarchy  of  Rome  was maintained

 with the senatorial nobility at the top;  the equites,  who were  of the  same economic class

 but lacked the prestige of  the senate,  still staffed  the jury-courts  and junior

 army  and  procuratorial  posts,  but  now  they  also  got   provincial  commands.

 Around  Augustus  there  was  not so  much a  'party' of  political alliance,  as a

 group  of  friends  or  clients  who  were  confidants  by  the personal  choice of

 Augustus.   Most   important   for    advisory,   administrative,    and   military

 positions was the dynastic network of the imperial family. </p>                        

       <p>In  both  the  ancient  and  modern  assessments  of  Augustus,  there  is  a

 tension  between  the  favorable  view  that  the  statesman  Augustus  atoned  for

 the  ruthlessness  of  Octavian,  and  the  negative  view  that  Augustus  pursued

 power  under  all  circumstances,  doomed  the  nobility,  slaughtered <i>libertas</i>,

 and was the  political forerunner  of World  War Two  continental dictators.  It is

 apparent, at least, that the most historically significant result of the principate

 was  the  restoration  of  a ratified  rule of  law, with  Augustus as  the supreme

 judge,  initiator,  and  executive  officer.  This   rule  evolved   gradually  and

 pragmatically;  its  basic  ideology  and  administration  were transmitted  by the

 dynastic system for centuries of relative stability at Rome.  </p>                     

<p><b>Ancient Sources</b></p>                                  

  <p>On  Augustus  as  Octavian,  Cicero's  letters  and  <i>Philippics</i>  describe the

 year  after Julius  Caesar's murder  (March 44  - summer  43 BC);  Plutarch's Lives

 of Brutus and Antony are sources for the triumviral period.                        

                                                                                   

 </p><p>      The   <i>Monumentum   Ancyranum</i>    is   an    inscription   known    since   the

 sixteenth  century  from  the  temple  of   'Rome  and   Augustus'  at   Ancyra  in

 Galatia.  The  inscription  is  Augustus's  own  account  of  his  achievements and

 honors  at  Rome.  This  account  is  commonly  known  by  its prefatory  title <i>Res

 Gestae  Divi  Augusti</i>,  or  "achievements  of  the  divine  Augustus."  The purpose

 of  the  inscription  was to  show and  justify Augustus's  influence and  power at

 Rome  and  in  the  Roman  world.  The  text,  which  is  addressed  to  the  Roman

 people,  describes  the  beginning  of  his  public  life, his  military successes,

  honors given to him, official expenditures  for the  public good,  foreign policy,

  and  ultimately the  highest honor  any Roman  could receive,  the title  of <i>pater

  patriae</i>, 'father of the country.' Since Augustus received this title in 2 B.C. the

  text of the  Ancyra inscription  appears to  date from  that time,  though earlier

  drafts  are  likely,   as  his   honors  and   achievements  grew.   According  to

  Suetonius  (Aug.  101,  4),  the  inscription was  originally designed  for bronze

  tablets  set  up  in  front of  Augustus's mausoleum  built substantially,  if not

  completely, in 28 BC at Rome.
