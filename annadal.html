<span face="Times">Anna Dalassena, Mother of Alexius I Comnenus (1081-1118)</span></h3></center>

&nbsp;
<p>Anna Dalassena (Anna Dalassene), 'Mother of the Comneni', was to play
an important role in orchestrating the rise to power of her family in the
second half of the eleventh century. Indeed, as regent, she openly administered
the empire in the early years of her son <b><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius
I's </a></b>reign. She had been born c. 1025-1030, daughter of Alexius
Charon and a Dalassena (the daughter of Adrian Dalassenus). Her father
had gained his name of 'Charon' because of the efficiency with which he
killed every enemy he encountered, and the fact that he adopted this new
surname implies that he had not been a member of a prominent family.<b><a href="#N_1_">[[1]]</a></b>
The more aristocratic Dalassenus family on Anna's mother's side originally
came from Dalasa-Tarash on the river Euphrates, though Adontz speculated
that the family may have had Armenian origins. Dalasseni served as governors
of Antioch in the late tenth and eleventh centuries, and were prominent
in the military in the Balkans in the 1060s and 1070s, being stationed
as commanders at Thessalonica, Serres and Skopje. Such was the family's
standing that Constantine Dalassenus (governor of Antioch in 1025) on two
separate occasions in 1028 and in 1041 nearly acquired the throne after
twice being short-listed as a candidate for marrying the much-married empress
<b><a href="zoe.html">Zoe</a></b>.<b><a href="#N_2_">[[2]]</a></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">Anna Dalassena, who throughout her life retained
the surname of her mother's family as more illustrious than that of her
father (or indeed that of her husband),</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_3_">[[3]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">&nbsp;
was married to </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johnycomn.html">John
Comnenus</a></span></b><span face="Times">, brother of the future emperor
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="isaaciicom.html">Isaac
I Comnenus,</a></span></b><span face="Times"> probably in 1044: their eldest
child Manuel was born in 1045.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_4_">[[4]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Anna was to become an exemplum of the new powerful matriarch, like her
predecessor the empress Eudocia Macrembolitissa, who ruled as regent for
her son </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikevii.html">Michael
VII Ducas</a></span></b><span face="Times"> (1071-1078), long after he
was of age. Not content with family concerns, including the bearing some
eight children -- Manuel, Maria, Isaac, Eudocia, Theodora, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">,
Adrian and Nicephorus -- Anna was to dominate her family after the death
of her husband in 1067 and actively encouraged and indeed organised her
sons' revolt against </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nikkieii.html">Nicephorus
III Botaniates</a></span></b><span face="Times"> in 1081. From 1067 she
was to cast a long shadow over Byzantine politics until her retirement
and death on 1 November 1100 or 1102.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_5_">[[5]]</a></span></b>
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times">Anna and her family prior to 1067</span></b></p></center>

<p><span face="Times">In 1057 Anna's brother-in-law Isaac was chosen by
a faction of rebel generals to succeed the elderly and inept </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikevi.html">Michael
VI Stratioticus</a></span></b><span face="Times">. As a result her husband
came to political prominence, being granted by his brother, now Isaac I
Comnenus, the titles <i>curopalates</i> and domestic of the <i>Scholae</i>,
or commander of the western armies.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_6_">[[6]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Anna's equivalent of these titles appears on seals describing her as
<i>curopalatissa</i>
and <i>domesticissa</i> and she would have been one of the most high-ranking
imperial women, with important roles to play in the ceremonies of the empress'
court, second only to the empress Aikaterina and her daughter Maria; the
<i>curopalatissa</i>
even ranked above the <i>zoste patricia</i> (a position created by the
emperor Theophilus for the empress' mother).</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_7_">[[7]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Unfortunately for Anna, after spirited opposition by the patriarchs Michael
I Cerularius and Constantine III Lichudes, and in the face of ill health,
Isaac allowed himself in late 1059 to be persuaded by Psellus, the historian
and one of Isaac's closest advisers, to abdicate. Isaac's wife and his
daughter (his only surviving child) became nuns. To make matters worse
from Anna's point of view, Isaac wanted to pass the throne to his brother
but John would not accept it, and it eventually went to </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="conniex.html">Constantine
X Ducas</a></span></b><span face="Times"> (1059-1067). Anna tried hard
to persuade her husband to become emperor, and, according to </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nickbry.html">Bryennius</a></span></b><span face="Times">
the family historian, she did everything she could, even to 'tears and
groans' to make John change his mind. He was unconvinced by the advantages
which would accrue to their children and by her fears for the family's
future, and Anna was forced unwillingly to give way.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_8_">[[8]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Interestingly her granddaughter Anna Comnena was to have a similar lack
of success in persuading her husband, this same historian </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nickbry.html">Nicephorus
Bryennius</a></span></b><span face="Times">, to make an attempt on the
throne at the accession of her brother John II in 1118.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_9_">[[9]]</a></span></b>

<p><b><span face="Times">Anna's intrigues under the Ducas regime</span></b></p></center>

<p><span face="Times">Following this failure to achieve imperial power,
Anna Dalassena maintained constant hostility to the Ducas family,</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_10_">[[10]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and 'lived for intrigue until she had succeeded in placing her son on the
throne.'</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_11_">[[11]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
For the fourteen years after her husband's death on 12 July 1067,</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_12_">[[12]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
she protected the family fortunes as uncontested matriarch and manoeuvred
her sons into a position from which they might seize power, until </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius'</a></span></b><span face="Times">
successful <i>coup d'état</i> in 1081 when only in his mid-twenties.
After seeing </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="conniex.html">Constantine
X Ducas</a></span></b><span face="Times"> on the throne between 1059 and
1067 in place of the husband she would have loved to see there, as part
of her master plan she then supported Constantine's widow, Eudocia Macrembolitissa,
and Eudocia's second husband </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romaniv.html">Romanus
IV Diogenes</a></span></b><span face="Times"> (1068-1071) against the rest
of the Ducas family who disapproved of this marriage. Anna Dalassena was
to be one of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romanusiv.html">Romanus'</a></span></b><span face="Times">
strongest supporters and saw her sons serving in his campaigns. Anna's
eldest son Manuel, despite his youth, was soon appointed <i>curopalates</i>
and <i>strategos autocrator</i> (commander-in-chief) in the East, and,
though captured by the Turks, successfully managed to convince the Turkish
sultan's rival, Chrysokoulos, to ally himself with the Byzantines against
his old master. However, Manuel died there following an ear infection in
the spring of 1071. Anna rushed from the capital to Bithynia to her son's
death-bed in a monastery, and performed his funeral rites; she then sent
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius
</a></span></b><span face="Times">her
third son (who was only fourteen years of age) to </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romanusiv.html">Romanus</a></span></b><span face="Times">
to serve in Manuel's stead, but because Anna's second son Isaac was already
with the army, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romanusiv.html">Romanus</a></span></b><span face="Times">
decided not to send </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius
</a></span></b><span face="Times">on
campaign out of consideration for his mother.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_13_">[[13]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">The Ducas family returned to power after </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romanusiv.html">Romanus
IV's</a></span></b><span face="Times"> defeat by the Seljuk Turks at the
battle of Mantzikert in 1071. Anna, however, retained her loyalties to</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romanusiv.html">
Romanus IV Diogenes</a></span></b><span face="Times"> and was targeted
by the new government (essentially now under the management of her old
enemy the Caesar John Ducas, uncle of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mkevii.html">Michael
VII</a></span></b><span face="Times">) for her loyalties to the overthrown
regime. She was put on trial, after letters which she had sent to </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romanusiv.html">Romanus</a></span></b><span face="Times">
were intercepted. The Comneni maintained that the correspondence had been
forged to incriminate her. </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nickbry.html">Bryennius</a></span></b><span face="Times">
relates that, during her trial at the palace on charges of treason, she
produced an icon of Christ from under her robe, proclaiming her innocence
and that Christ, 'the Supreme Judge who knows the secrets of the heart',
was the judge between them and herself.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_14_">[[14]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Her judges were overawed by her dignity and severity, but were forced to
convict her as a rebel, and she was banished to a monastery on the island
of Principo, a favourite retreat for exiled imperial women, along with
her sons, at the beginning of 1072. Whatever her protestations of innocence,
if we bear in mind that she had recently married her daughter Theodora
to </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romanusiv.html">Romanus
IV's</a></span></b><span face="Times"> son Constantine, it is highly likely
that she <i>was</i> in fact still intriguing to restore </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romanusiv.html">Romanus
</a></span></b><span face="Times">to
the throne, and her exile might not have been undeserved. Some of her seals
prior to 1081 bear the titles <i>monache</i> (nun) as well as <i>curopalatissa</i>,
so Anna either took the veil on the death of her husband or during this
period of exile in her Principo monastery.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_15_">[[15]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
She was however shortly afterwards recalled to the capital when the Caesar
John Ducas lost his influence over the new and indecisive emperor <b><a href="mikevii.html">Michael
VII</a></b>. </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_16_">[[16]]</a></span></b>
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times">Family networking</span></b></p></center>

<p><span face="Times">An important part of Anna's strategy had been the
forming of an intricate network of marriage connections with a number of
prominent families, which was to facilitate her family's rise to power.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_17_">[[17]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Of her two eldest girls, Maria, at the time of her father's death in 1067,
was already married to Michael Taronites, and Eudocia to Nicephorus Melissenus,
both members of prominent military families. Anna's eldest son Manuel and
her youngest daughter Theodora formed alliances with the Diogenes family:
Anna herself organised the marriage of Theodora to </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romanusiv.html">Romanus
IV's</a></span></b><span face="Times"> son Constantine after her husband's
death, clearly to consolidate her support of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romanusiv.html">Romanus'</a></span></b><span face="Times">
regime, but this marriage was not to be successful despite Anna Comnena's
portrayal of Theodora's grief after his death.</span><b><a href="#N_18_">[[18]]</a></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">Following Anna Dalassena's banishment and return
to court under </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikevii.html">Michael
VII Ducas</a></span></b><span face="Times">, she continued to pursue her
strategy of ambitious matchmaking. By no stretch of the imagination could
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikevii.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
have been called an efficient ruler (his mother had kept him out of power
for several years, though he was legally of age), and there might well
have been an expectation that his regime would not be long lasting. Anna's
first move, however, was an alliance with the emperor's own family. </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikevii.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
seems to have been anxious to keep her 'on side' and allowed her eldest
surviving son Isaac to marry the Georgian princess Irene, the cousin of
his own wife </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="maryal.html">Maria
of Alania</a></span></b><span face="Times">.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_19_">[[19]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
The first of their children, John, was born in late 1073.</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">It is possible that this cousin Irene was the 'Alan
princess', a hostage at court who had been mistress of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="zoe.html">Zoe's</a></span></b><span face="Times">third
husband
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="connieix.html">Constantine
IX Monomachus.</a><a href="#N_20_">[[20]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
In this case she would have been in Constantinople since c. 1054. However,
Isaac Comnenus' wife was still producing children in 1096 and it is therefore
unlikely that she had been Constantine's mistress more than 40 years earlier.
It would also seem unlikely that Anna Dalassena would have sanctioned her
son's marriage to an ex-imperial mistress, though in the interest of the
family she might have been prepared to overlook an earlier palace liaison.</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">This was a shrewd move: an alliance with </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikevii.html">Michael</a></span></b><span face="Times">
himself might not have been worth more than prestige, but marriage to the
empress's cousin was to be a catalyst for revolution. Though the marriage
did not extend Comnenian connections among Byzantine aristocratic families,
it was </span><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="maryal.html"><b>Maria
of Alania</b> </a></span><span face="Times">in 1081 who was to play a critical
part in ousting her second husband, <b><a href="nickiii.html">Nicephorus
III Botaniates</a></b>, from power and ensuring the accession of the Comneni.
Anna even at this point may well have been aware of the potential influence
of the empress consort -- especially this particular empress -- at times
of transition. It is difficult to assess how closely Anna and </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="maryal.html">Maria
</a></span></b><span face="Times">might
have known each other at this point, but </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="maryal.html">Maria</a></span></b><span face="Times">
had been empress since 1071 and Anna had been an emperor's sister-in-law
and presumably retained her high rank at court as <i>curopalatissa</i>,
one of the highest female dignitaries in the empress' court.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_21_">[[21]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Her status there and association with the empress in the 'court of the
women' must have given Anna a close knowledge of the character and priorities
of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="maryal.html">Maria
of Alania</a></span></b><span face="Times">.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_22_">[[22]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">Anna had also to make arrangements for an alliance
for her second surviving son. Alexius had been briefly married or engaged
to an Argyropoulaena (the Argyri were a very wealthy military family and
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romanusiii.html">Romanus
III Argyrus</a></span></b><span face="Times"> had been </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="zoep.html">Zoe'</a></span><span face="Times">s</span></b><span face="Times">
first husband).</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_23_">[[23]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Following the girl's death, the Caesar John Ducas (uncle of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikevii.html">Michael
VII</a></span></b><span face="Times">), in the September of 1077, persuaded
Anna to allow </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomnen.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">
to marry his granddaughter Irene Ducaena, one of the three daughters of
his son Andronicus, who had led the retreat at Mantzikert which caused
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romandio.html">Romanus
IV's</a></span></b><span face="Times"> defeat and downfall. The marriage
probably took place early in the next year when Irene was twelve; </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomnen.html">Alexius
</a></span></b><span face="Times">had
been born c. 1056/1057, for he was fourteen at the time of</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romandio.html">
Romanus IV's</a></span></b><span face="Times"> expedition against the Turks
in 1070.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_24_">[[24]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Anna Dalassena's hostility towards the Ducas family was still implacable:
according to </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="annacom.html">Anna
Comnena</a></span></b><span face="Times">, 'the family Ducas had long recognised
the undisguised hatred the Mother of the Comneni bore them. They lived
in constant dread and suspicion of her as I have repeatedly heard them
tell.'</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_25_">[[25]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
However, they were arguably of greater prominence than the Comneni at this
point, and Irene was the ruling emperor's cousin once removed: the alliance
was an expedient one and was to be followed by even closer links. In 1081
or shortly afterwards, Anna Dalassena's son Adrian married </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="zoep.html">Zoe</a></span></b><span face="Times">,
daughter of Eudocia Macrembolitissa and Constantine X Ducas, thus uniting
the families of two great marriage-brokers even more closely.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_26_">[[26]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
The date of Eudocia's death is not known, but she seems not to have been
alive at this point as her son Nicephorus Diogenes is said to have arranged
the match: his brother Constantius Ducas had wanted in 1077 to see his

</p><p><span face="Times">These links with </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikevii.html">Michael

to Anna's ambition and intrigue against them. An initial Comnenian coup
was forestalled by that of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nickiii.html">Botaniates</a></span></b><span face="Times">
in 1078, who was then to proceed to marry his predecessor's ex-wife, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="maryal.html">Maria
of Alania</a></span></b><span face="Times">. </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">
had certainly attempted to persuade Constantius Ducas, Eudocia's son and
<b><a href="mikevii.html">Michael

and this step must have represented Anna's views too and presumably Eudocia's.
Had this been successful she would have reaped great rewards from her networking
with the Ducas family. Nevertheless, with</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nickiii.html">Botaniates</a></span></b><span face="Times">in
power, Anna immediately took steps to form an alliance with the new regime,
betrothing her granddaughter Anna, the only daughter of Manuel, her eldest
son (now deceased), to </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nickiii.html">Botaniates'</a></span></b><span face="Times">grandson,

escaped without their noticing: the house gates were closed by Isaac and

<p><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times">The revolt of the Comneni</span></b></p></center>

<p><span face="Times">In their rebellion in 1081 the Comneni were to be
greatly aided by the current empress, <b><a href="maryal.html">Maria of
Alania</a></b>. The wife of both </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikevii.html">Michael
VII Ducas</a></span></b><span face="Times"> and then of <b><a href="nickiii.html">Nicephorus
III Botaniates</a></b>, <b><a href="maryal.html">Maria's</a></b> interests
centred on the future of her son by <b>Michael Ducas</b>, the purple-born
Constantine. <b><a href="nickiii.html">Nicephorus'</a></b> decision, to
leave the throne not to this boy but to one of his own relatives, resulted
in </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="maryal.html">Maria's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
throwing in her lot with the Comneni and betraying her husband. The moving
force behind this unofficial alliance appears to have been Anna Dalassena,
who encouraged her sons to liaise with <b><a href="maryal.html">Maria</a></b>
and who saw the potential value of having the empress as an ally and an
inside informant about intrigues at court.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_33_">[[33]]</a></span><span face="Times"><a href="maryal.html">Maria</a></span></b><span face="Times">was
already closely linked with the Comneni through her cousin Irene's marriage
to Isaac Comnenus, and this relationship allowed the two young men to visit
the empress privately, on Anna Dalassena's suggestion. To facilitate this
conspiracy and allow the Comneni unrestricted access to her quarters, <b><a href="maryal.html">Maria</a></b>
had even adopted </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">
as her son, though he was not so much younger than herself (she was born
c. 1052 and thus was only some five years his senior) so he could visit
her frequently and in private.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_34_">[[34]]</a><a href="maryal.html">Maria</a></span></b><span face="Times">
was supposedly persuaded to the adoption by officials of the women's quarters,
presumably her own 'Alans' and her eunuch officials, who had been instigated
to this by Isaac Comnenus. Obviously Anna Dalassena was consulted on this
move and was probably the plan's originator: </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">
already had a mother -- it would only have been courteous to inform her
that she was getting a colleague (and one much younger and more beautiful):
after all two mothers might be considered by some to be one too many.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_35_">[[35]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Knowing Anna Dalassena's tight hold over her family, it must have been
with her agreement that she now shared </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">
with another mother figure. As a result of this adoption, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="maryal.html">Maria's</a></span></b><span face="Times">
son Constantine were now adoptive brothers, and Isaac and Alexius took
an oath that they would preserve Constantine's rights as emperor.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_36_">[[36]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
By passing on inside information to the brothers, <b><a href="maryal.html">Maria</a></b>
was an invaluable ally in the plot against her second husband.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_37_">[[37]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
We do not know what direct contact there was between <b><a href="Maryal.html">Maria</a></b>
and Anna, but the latter was clearly the mastermind of the conspiracy.</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">So once again, this betrothal of her granddaughter
to one of <b><a href="nickiii.html">Nicephorus III Botaniates'</a></b> closest
relatives had not stopped Anna intriguing against the new regime in the
interests of her family. When her sons Isaac and </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">left
Constantinople on 14 February 1081 to form an army to take the field against
<b><a href="nickiii.html">Nicephorus
III</a></b>, Anna mobilised the rest of her family and took refuge in St
Sophia, from there negotiating with the emperor for the safety of family
members in Constantinople, as well as protesting her sons' allegiance to</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nickiii.html">
Nicephorus III </a></span></b><span face="Times">and (disingenuously) their
innocence of treachery against the regime.</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">Gathering the whole household on the pretence of
making an evening visit for the purposes of worship at the city's churches,
but deliberately avoiding the inclusion of <a href="nickiii.html"><b>Nicephorus
III</b>'s </a>grandson and his tutor, the women's horses were appropriately
prepared with their saddle-cloths, while Isaac and <b><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></b>
locked the house gates and ceremoniously handed Anna, as head of the household,
the keys. Even before the first cockcrow the women of the family -- mother,
sisters, wives and children -- proceeded on foot to the Forum of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="conniei.html">Constantine</a></span></b><span face="Times">.
From here the men departed on the first stage of their rebellion, and the
women hurried to St Sophia. When the boy's tutor missed them and arrived
in search of them, Anna pretended that the visit to the churches was to
be followed by one to the palace and deceived him into preceding them to
announce their imminent arrival.</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">To gain entry from the verger at the sanctuary of
Bishop Nicholas near the Great Church, the women pretended to be visitors
from Asia Minor who had spent all their money and wanted to worship before
beginning their return journey. When </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nickiii.html">Nicephorus
III</a></span></b><span face="Times"> sent his eunuch Straboromanus and
other envoys to summon them to the palace, Anna protested that her sons
were entirely loyal to his regime and had fled to escape a plot forged
by jealous enemies who wanted them blinded.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_38_">[[38]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
She refused to go with the envoys, first angrily demanding that they allow
her to enter St Sophia to pray to the Theotokos (the Mother of God). When
this request was granted her histrionic abilities came into full play:</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">She was allowed to enter [St Sophia]. As if she were
weighed down with old age and worn out by grief, she walked slowly (in
reality she was pretending to be weary) and when she approached the actual
entrance to the sanctuary made two genuflections; on the third she sank
to the floor and taking firm hold of the sacred doors, cried in a loud
voice: 'Unless my hands are cut off, I will not leave this holy place,
except on one condition: that I receive the emperor's cross as guarantee
of safety.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_39_">[[39]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">She thus forced </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nickiii.html">Nicephorus
III Botaniates</a></span></b><span face="Times"> into a public statement
that he would protect the family. His envoys tried to accede to her request.
However, in her view, the cross handed her by her emperor's messenger Straboromanus
was not sufficiently visible: it had to be a cross of reasonable size so
that all bystanders could witness the oath. Also the cross had to be sent
by the emperor personally as a clear guarantee of his good faith. </span><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nickiii.html"><b>Nicephorus
III</b> </a></span><span face="Times">obliged, sending her not only the
cross but a complete reassurance of her continued safety. The women - Anna
and her daughters and daughters-in-law including Irene of Georgia (Isaac's
wife and </span><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="maryal.html"><b>Maria
of Alania's</b> </a></span><span face="Times">cousin) who had joined them
in St Sophia -- then for their own protection left for the convent of Petrion
at the emperor's orders, where they were followed at the emperor's command
by Irene Ducaena's mother, Maria of Bulgaria. They were refugees rather
than prisoners: 'their cellars, granaries and all their store-houses were
to be kept free of all interference' (which shows the importance of their
economic contribution to the household) and they were allowed to have their
own food brought in. They were also clearly on good terms with the guards
whom Maria of Bulgaria bribed with the best of their food in exchange for
news of current events.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_40_">[[40]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Anna Dalassena had thus distracted the emperor and given her sons time
to arm themselves, acquire horses from the imperial stables, and escape,
while also lulling </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nickiii.html">Botaniates</a></span></b><span face="Times">
into a false sense of security on the grounds that there was no real threat
against him.</span>
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times">Ultimate success</span></b></p></center>

<p><span face="Times">On her sons' victorious entry into the city on 1
April 1081, Anna may have tried again to prevent the hated Ducas family
from sharing the imperial honours: she had never liked the marriage of
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">
to Irene Ducaena,</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_41_">[[41]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and the situation was now worse in that the teenage Irene would be Augusta.
After all, which of the two brothers -- Isaac or </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">
-- was to take the throne had not been not a settled affair until the intervention
of the Caesar John Ducas in favour of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">
during the course of the revolt, and the realisation that </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius'</a></span></b><span face="Times">
troops were closer at hand than Isaac's.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_42_">[[42]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">There
had been two rival factions in favour of Isaac and </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius
</a></span></b><span face="Times">respectively,
and, though Anna Comnena makes Alexius' accession seem a <i>fait accompli,</i>
he was some six years the junior. This may not have been what Anna Dalassena
had planned; she may have expected Isaac and his Georgian wife to take
the throne, and </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius'</a></span></b><span face="Times">
accession would have made her more anxious than ever to dissolve her son's
connection with the Ducas family. There was certainly suspicion at the
time that </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius
</a></span></b><span face="Times">was
planning to divorce Irene and marry
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="maryal.html">Maria
of Alania</a></span></b><span face="Times">, thus making her empress for
the third time. Undoubtedly this plan would have been masterminded by Anna.
After all Maria's son by </span><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="mikevii.html"><b>Michael
VII Ducas</b> </a></span><span face="Times">was born in the purple, a 'porphyrogenitus',
and already crowned emperor, and Maria would hardly have supported </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">
had she anticipated that her son would be demoted: she doubtless had been
assured that the two adoptive 'brothers' would rule together. The fact
that </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius
</a></span></b><span face="Times">moved
into the palace with </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="maryal.html">Maria</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and his blood relatives, and was crowned alone on 4 April, while the fourteen-year
old Irene remained for several days with her own family, and was not crowned
till a week later, was highly suspicious. Indeed it is possible that Anna
Dalassena, whose relationship with </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="maryal.html">Maria</a></span></b><span face="Times">
must have been close for nearly a decade, had all along planned the rejection
of Irene in the contingency that it was her son </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">
who would rise to the purple. After all they were 'both' his mothers and
united by this bond of adoption -- why should not </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="maryal.html">Maria</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and Anna share the throne as </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius'
</a></span></b><span face="Times">mothers
and wife? </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="maryal.html">Maria</a></span></b><span face="Times">,
already an empress-mother twice over through her own son Constantine and
her adopted son </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">,
was far more regal and experienced than the little Irene, who as yet had
no children (their eldest child, Anna Comnena, was not to be born until
December 1083), and who, to make things worse, was a Ducaena.</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">In her disingenuous account of this episode, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="annacom.html">Anna
Comnena</a></span></b><span face="Times"> states that the Comneni refused
to drive Mary from the palace, because of the many kindnesses they had
received from her as empress and because of their close relationship, while
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="maryal.html">Maria</a></span></b><span face="Times">
herself was reluctant to leave because of her lonely position: 'she was
in a foreign country, without relatives, without friends, with nobody whatever
of her own folk.'</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_43_">[[43]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
That there is a cover-up here is obvious.</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">It is true that <b><a href="maryal.html">Maria's</a></b>
marriage to </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">
would have been canonically illegal because his brother Isaac was married
to her cousin.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_44_">[[44]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
In addition, her first two husbands, <b><a href="mikevii.html">Michael VII
Ducas</a></b> and <b><a href="nickiii.html">Nicephorus III Botaniates</a></b>,
were still alive. But rules were made to be broken - the practice of 'economy
'('economia') by the Byzantine church saw to that.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_45_">[[45]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
In the end, however, Irene's rights were vehemently supported by her grandfather
the Caesar John Ducas, her brother-in-law George Palaeologus (the admiral
in charge of the fleet), and the Patriarch Cosmas. George Palaeologus was
particularly under the influence of his mother-in-law, Irene's mother Maria
of Bulgaria, who had insisted on his joining the Comnenian rebellion,</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_46_">[[46]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and under such circumstances he would certainly have supported his sister-in-law.
In the end, therefore, a compromise was reached. The Comneni wanted to
appoint a new patriarch, the monk and eunuch Eustratius Garidas, who was
a personal friend and protégé of Anna Dalassena's and who
had supposedly already prophesied</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">
Alexius' </a></span></b><span face="Times">rise to the throne to the 'Mother
of the Comneni':</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_47_">[[47]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
the implication is that, as a long-term supporter of and propagandist for
the family, he was more pliable than Cosmas and more in tune with their
plans for the church and establishment. Cosmas, however, refused to resign
the patriarchate unless he personally crowned Irene. This was reported
to 'the empress', Anna Dalassena, by her sons and the decision was finally
made. So Irene was crowned seven days after </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">,
and any deal which Anna or <b><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></b> may
have done with <b><a href="maryal.html">Maria of Alania</a></b> was aborted;
Cosmas resigned and was replaced with Eustratius, Anna Dalassena's nominee.
At least she had gained the patriarch of her choice to offset the rank
of her hated daughter-in-law.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_48_">[[48]]</a></span></b>
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times">Empress and uncontested matriarch</span></b></p></center>

<p><span face="Times">He loved her exceedingly and depended on her for
advice (such was his affection for her). His right hand he devoted to her
service; his ears listened for her bidding. In all things he was entirely
subservient, in fact, to her wishes. I can sum up the whole situation thus:
he was in theory the emperor, but she had real power.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_49_">[[49]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">So </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="annacom.html">Anna
Comnena </a></span></b><span face="Times">describes the relationship between
her father and grandmother during the early years of his reign. True that
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="annacom.html">Anna
</a></span></b><span face="Times">was
writing more than forty years after her grandmother's death,</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_50_">[[50]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and admits that she only knew her grandmother for a short time, as Dalassena
died while her granddaughter was in her late teens.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_51_">[[51]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
And after all Anna Comnena spent much of her youth being brought up by
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="maryal.html">Maria
of Alania</a></span></b><span face="Times">.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_52_">[[52]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
But she insists that all she says is the truth -- indeed, Dalassena is
also praised by the family historian Bryennius, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="annacom.html">Anna
Comnena's </a></span></b><span face="Times">husband. No doubt there had
been tension in the imperial family as a result of Anna Dalassena's maternal
influence over <b><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></b>, for her position
markedly overshadowed that of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius'</a></span></b><span face="Times">
consort Irene, to whom her daughter was also devoted, and who, with </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">,
is the subject of the <i>Alexiad's</i> panegyric. Yet Bryennius himself
had been commissioned to write up the deeds of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">
by Irene Ducaena,</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_53_">[[53]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and must have considered his eulogistic treatment of Dalassena appropriate
for his patron and audience, though Irene died in 1123, before the work
was finished.</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">There was nothing unmanly or inappropriate in Byzantium
about revering your mother. </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nickbry.html">Bryennius</a></span></b><span face="Times">
says that </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">
was, 'if any man was', a war-lover and a mother-lover.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_54_">[[54]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
The two are seen as complementary, which tells us a great deal about Anna
Dalassena. Both </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius
</a></span></b><span face="Times">and
his elder brother Isaac are depicted as relying totally on their mother's
judgement. Indeed at the conclusion of their coup, in their victorious
march into the capital on 1 April 1081, they stopped at the square of the
martyr George Sykeotes to wonder whether they should first go to pay their
respects to 'their mothers' (presumably not only Anna Dalassena but <b><a href="maryal.html">Maria
of Alania</a></b> as well) 'according to custom', before proceeding to
secure the palace - Caesar John Ducas represented this as unnecessary dawdling
under the circumstances and made them postpone the family reunion until
later.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_55_">[[55]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
From his very first day as emperor </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">
relied on his mother's advice and he shared all his plans with her, while
she was kept minutely informed of anything of importance.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_56_">[[56]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
When Isaac's son John was cleared c. 1094 at Philippopolis of charges of
plotting against the emperor, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius'

role as father had doubtless been more in the example he set in warfare,
though he hardly had the chance to be prominent during the Ducas regime.
Standard education at the time included training in philosophy, grammar
and rhetoric, the Bible, and classical literature, while noble boys were
also expected to take part in physical exercise, such as ball games, hunting,
and archery to develop military skills. Anna's five sons were expected
to have military careers: the eldest, Manuel, served in the army during
his father's lifetime and was successful enough to be appointed protostrator
by</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romaniv.html"> Romanus
IV</a></span></b><span face="Times">. He was commander of all the Eastern
troops when he died in 1071 at the age of twenty-six. Isaac was already
in the military at the point and served as the domestic of the East, where,
like Manuel, he was captured by the Turks, and ransomed c. 1073. He was
then sent c. 1074 to Antioch as governor where he remained until 1078.
The same was the case for the younger sons. At Manuel's death, Alexius
was 14 years of age and was sent to take his brother's place in the armed
forces, but this was blocked by </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romaniv.html">Romanus
IV </a></span></b><span face="Times">out of consideration for his mother
- implying that the age itself was not a problem.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_59_">[[59]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">The youngest boys, Adrian and </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nickiii.html">Nicephorus
</a></span></b><span face="Times">had
also received appropriate training to become, under Alexius, Grand Domestic
and Commander of the fleet respectively.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_60_">[[60]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Their upbringing was entirely due to their mother: from the time of her
husband's death, Anna Dalassena made sure these two youngest sons had 'tutors
instructed to give them well-rounded instruction'.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_61_">[[61]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
The children's other skills were not neglected: as emperor </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius
</a></span></b><span face="Times">enjoyed
hunting and polo, and frequently played chess with his relatives after
his afternoon siesta.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_62_">[[62]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">Anna's main influence on her sons, however, as depicted
by her granddaughter, was in the area of piety and religious conformity.
To please his mother 'whom he so dearly loved' and by whose 'admonitions
he directed his conduct', </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">
when on campaign always had a monk in his tent till he married. These monks
were considered important enough for </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="anncom.html">Anna
Comnena</a></span></b><span face="Times">, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nickbry.html">Bryennius
</a></span></b><span face="Times">and
Kataspekenos, author of the life of St Cyril the Phileote, to record the
separate names of several of these monks - a certain 'Little John', Symeon,
and Ignatius.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_63_">[[63]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Not only did these act as his spiritual advisors, there was no possibility
for him to get into mischief when away from his mother's eye; after all,
if Byzantine armies were anything like those of the crusaders, prostitutes
were a regular part of the baggage-train.</span>
</p><p><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="annacom.html">Anna</a></span></b><span face="Times">
portrays her father after the conquest of Constantinople by his troops
as filled with terror of the wrath of God. He consulted his mother seriously
on how to relieve his conscience for the pillaging of the capital and its
churches and took her advice to lay the case before senior churchmen: on
the instruction of the patriarch Cosmas and other church leaders, the imperial
family took to fasting and sleeping on the floor with stone pillows, while
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">
in addition wore sackcloth for forty days and nights.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_64_">[[64]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
During his reign he also engaged seriously in matters of theology: in his
investigation of the Bogomils, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="annacom.html">Anna</a></span></b><span face="Times">
portrays him as having studied the Holy Writings more than anyone else
in order to sharpen his tongue for combating heretics,</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_65_">[[65]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
an interest no doubt inspired by his mother's preoccupations.</span>
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times">'Mother of the emperor'</span></b></p></center>

<p><span face="Times">Anna's position as mother of the emperor was now
assured, and the term appears on her seals of this period as an official
title. One common type of seal reads: 'Lord, protect Anna Dalassena, nun,
mother of the emperor,' and it depicts the Transfiguration of Christ and
the 'dormitio' (Assumption) of the Theotokos.<sup> </sup></span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_66_">[[66]]</a><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius
</a></span></b><span face="Times">gave
Anna a place in the court hierarchy and awarded her the title
<i>despoina</i>
(empress or mistress), though she was not crowned: perhaps it was not considered
appropriate that the title <i>Augusta</i> be given to someone already wearing
the monastic habit, as she did even on the day of her son's coronation.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_67_">[[67]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
But, more importantly, it was Anna who wielded political power. In the
early years of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius'
</a></span></b><span face="Times">reign,
especially in the years 1081-1095, when he and the other adult males of
the family were frequently on campaign against Normans, Pechenegs and Seljuk
Turks, she acted as regent and was given a wide sphere of authority, with
almost total control over the entire civil government. </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="annacom.html">Comnena</a></span></b><span face="Times">
speaks of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">
in this period as doing nothing without Anna Dalassena's advice; taking
her as his confidante and co-partner in government; involving her increasingly
in state affairs; and declaring openly that without her intellect and judgement
the empire would not survive.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_68_">[[68]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">While Anna herself is shown as desiring the monastic
life instead of this political prominence, her 'quite exceptional' love
for her son is said to have overridden her own desires and she was persuaded
to govern with him. Indeed she at times 'alone drove the chariot of power
- and without accident or error'.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_69_">[[69]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Her 'fine intellect' and 'really first-class aptitude for government' had
no doubt been honed as the matriarch and controller of a huge propertied
household and extensive family network and were fully recognised by her
son. This is born out by </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="annacom.html">Anna
Comnena's</a></span></b><span face="Times"> frequent term for her grandmother
as the 'Mother of the Comneni' -- her political role springs naturally
from her maternal function.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_70_">[[70]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius'</a></span></b><span face="Times">
reliance on Anna culminated in the <i>chrysobull</i> of August 1081, in
which she was nominated as regent following Robert Guiscard's invasion
of Epirus, and in which he declared her decisions to be above all present
and future criticism -- they were to stand whether justified or unjustified,
as were the actions of her ministers and officials. She was to be responsible
to no one.</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">This famous official document, which Anna Comnena
purports to quote verbatim (omitting only the scribe's professional embellishments),
begins with the remarkable words:</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">"When danger is foreseen or some other dreadful occurrence
is expected, there is no safeguard stronger than a mother who is understanding
and loves her son, for, if she gives counsel, her advice will be reliable;
if she offers prayers, they will confer strength and certain protection.
Such at any rate has been the experience of myself, your emperor, in the
case of my own revered mother, who has taught and guided and sustained
me throughout, from my earliest years. She had a place in aristocratic
society, but her first concern was for her son and his faith in her was
preserved intact. It was well known that one soul animated us, physically
separated though we were, and by the grace of Christ that happy state has
persisted to this day. Never were those cold words, 'mine' and 'yours',
uttered between us, and, what was even more important, the prayers she
poured out during all that time reached the ears of the Lord and have raised
me now to the imperial throne."</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_71_">[[71]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">This sentiment, publicly stating Alexius' faith in
his mother and their mutual respect and devotion, was beautifully reworked
by the Alexandrian poet Constantine Cavafy in 1927, in his poem <i>Anna
Dalassene</i>, in which the last line of the poem directly incorporates
Anna Comnena's own phraseology:</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">In the golden bull that Alexius Comnenus issued</span>
<br><span face="Times">Especially to honour his mother,</span>
<br><span face="Times">The very sagacious Anna Dalassene --</span>
<br><span face="Times">Who was renowned in both her deeds and habits of
life --</span>
<br><span face="Times">There are many words of praise.</span>
<br><span face="Times">Here, of them all, I present just one phrase,</span>
<br><span face="Times">One that is beautiful and sublime:</span>
<br><span face="Times">'That, between us, those cold words "mine" and "yours"
were never spoken.'</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_72_">[[72]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius'
</a></span></b><span face="Times">appointment
of this 'impregnable bulwark for good government', his 'revered mother,
of all women most honoured', as controller of the entire administration,
explicitly gives her supreme administrative power in the emperor's absence.
She is praised in this public document for her vast experience of secular
affairs (despite the low value she personally set on them), as a result
of which any decree of hers in writing, whether referred to her by the
<i>logothete</i>
or his subordinate officers or any other administrator concerned with the
remission of public debts, is to have permanent validity. Any decision
or order, written or unwritten, which bears her seal is to be ratified
-- and here </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius
</a></span></b><span face="Times">specifically
describes her official seal with its depiction of the Transfiguration and
the Assumption. She is to have full power over promotions, successions
to the tribunals and fiscs (i.e., the hierarchy of judges and finance officials),
and over the granting of honours, offices and donations of immoveable property.
She is also to have unquestioned control over matters such as increases
of salary, additional gifts, reductions of tax, economies and diminution
of payments. All economic affairs, great and small, are in her domain.
'In brief,' the chrysobull continues, 'Nothing shall be reckoned invalid
which she commands either in writing or by word of mouth, for her words
and her decisions shall be reckoned as my own and none of them shall be
annulled. In years to come they shall have the force of law permanently'.
In other words, she and all her officials are free of the threat of any
future investigation or examination, whether their actions appear reasonable
or ridiculous: her decisions are to be unquestioned. </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="annacom.html">Anna
Comnena</a></span></b><span face="Times"> in summing up this decree comments
that Alexius yielded his mother precedence in everything, 'relinquishing
the reins of government, as it were, and running alongside as <i>she</i>
drove the imperial chariot.'</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_73_">[[73]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">Of course, this picture has to be modified. In her
son's absence on his first Norman campaign, Dalassena is here given an
effective
<i>carte blanche</i>, especially in questions of financial and
judicial matters. She is not given total control over the entire administration,
and indeed we know that in late 1081 Isaac was left in Constantinople to
keep order and subvert enemy propaganda. His role was also to guard the
palace and city, and 'at the same time to comfort the women [who were]
inclined to be tearful. As far as his mother was concerned, help was, I
suppose, uncalled for -- she was herself a tower of strength and in any
case a highly skilled administrator', comments her granddaughter.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_74_">[[74]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">Dalassena is shown here as free of all normal feminine
weakness, but still, as far as military affairs are concerned, it is her
son Isaac who is delegated to organise the defence of the city. But what
is important in the chrysobull is the detail in which her priorities and
abilities are characterised and seen as having an important bearing on
government. The emphasis on her vast experience of secular matters highlights
the experiences of the propertied Byzantine <i>materfamilias</i>, who is,
almost by definition, fully equipped to deal with the financial problems
of the empire, a similar institution, just on a larger scale.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_75_">[[75]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Her piety is also seen as having a direct relevance to good government.
Significantly, her administration was individual enough to be disliked
and criticised. The historian and lawyer Zonaras highlights her unpopularity,
depicting her as hated and despotic, and this was doubtless the general
reaction to her role of balancing the budget and managing the treasury
in order to finance </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius'</a></span></b><span face="Times">
campaigns. Zonaras states that she was blamed for the financial demands
on the empire,</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_76_">[[76]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
but she was not alone in having to make savings: </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">
himself had to cut salaries and confiscate property. Early in his reign
</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius
</a></span></b><span face="Times">had
to debase the coinage: this took place in the first decade of his reign
before his monetary reform of 1092, and the main facilitator of this debasement
would have been Anna Dalassena.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_77_">[[77]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">Certainly the empire at </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius'</a></span></b><span face="Times">
accession was facing a desperate economic crisis. Under pressure of the
campaign against the Normans in the winter of 1081/1082, Anna Dalassena
and Isaac were forced to appropriate church possessions to finance the
war. </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="annacom.html">Comnena</a></span></b><span face="Times">
tells us that the treasury had been totally emptied by </span><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="nickiii.html"><b>Nicephorus
III Botaniates</b>:</a></span><span face="Times"> it was so bare that there
was no point in locking the doors. After mobilising all possible assets
from within the family (Irene Ducaena was an especially enthusiastic contributor),
Anna Dalassena and Isaac were able to send some funds to the emperor to
purchase the assistance of mercenaries, but this was still insufficient.
After lengthy public and private discussions, they examined the 'ancient
laws and canons on the alienation of sacred objects', discovering that
it was permissible to use sacred objects for the ransoming of prisoners-of-war.
With a little ingenuity this could be interpreted to include any Christians
who were living in Asia under Turkish rule, who by definition needed to
be liberated. And so, to pay the army and mercenaries, Anna Dalassena and
Isaac decided to liquidate sacred objects which were 'idle and [had been]
set aside as serving no purpose'. It was Isaac, however, who convened and
spoke at the synod in St Sophia to present their case. Despite certain
very vocal opposition, their proposal was accepted, but </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="annacom.html">Anna
Comnena </a></span></b><span face="Times">admits that there was considerable
long-term resentment over this radical decision and that the emperor had
later to promise reparation.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_78_">[[78]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">While </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius
</a></span></b><span face="Times">may
also have initially created the position of <i>logothete ton sekreton</i>
as an official to assist his mother, as a 'technical coordinator of services',
not as a supervisor of her decisions,</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_79_">[[79]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and it appears that Anna shared regency powers with Isaac and that her
power was limited to financial and legal matters, this hardly diminishes
the uniqueness of her position, and indeed demonstrates an unequivocal
confidence in her skills in stabilising the economy.</span>
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times">Anna's political skills</span></b></p></center>

<p><span face="Times">Anna Dalassena was remarkable for her eloquence,
diligence and political <i>nous</i>. </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="annacom.html">Comnena</a></span></b><span face="Times">
tells us that as a speaker she was quick-witted, lucid and effective: 'truly
a most persuasive orator; she was neither garrulous and one who lengthily
protracted her speeches, nor did the inspiration of her discourse quickly
desert her.'</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_80_">[[80]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Diligent too, by the morning's second cock-crow,</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_81_">[[81]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
with her secretary Genesius, she would be applying herself to state business
and deciding matters such as the election of magistrates and replies to
petitioners.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_82_">[[82]]</a><a href="alexcomn.htrm">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">
himself is said to have admitted that 'she had attained perfection in all
things, and far surpassed everyone living at the time in prudence and political
wisdom.'</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_83_">[[83]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="annacom.html">Anna</a></span></b><span face="Times">
was certainly possessed of remarkable administrative skills, gained through
her experience as head of a large propertied family. Anna Comnena praises
her grandmother for her 'intellect' even as quite a young woman,</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_84_">[[84]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and records that:</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">My grandmother had an exceptional grasp of public
affairs, with a genius for _ organisation and government; she was capable,
in fact, of managing not only the Roman Empire, but every other empire
under the sun as well. She had vast experience and a wide understanding
of the motives, ultimate consequences, _interrelations good and bad of
various courses of action, _penetrating quickly to the right solution,
adroitly and quickly carrying it out  I must add this: not only was she
a very great credit to her own sex, <i>but to men as well</i> [my italics];
indeed she contributed to the glory of the whole human race.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_85_">[[85]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">According to </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="annacom.html">Comnena</a></span></b><span face="Times">,
the emperor in his early years did his mother's bidding like a slave: she
was legislator, co-ordinator and governor.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_86_">[[86]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
We might assume an element of uncritical adulation here, though </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="annacom.html">Anna</a></span></b><span face="Times">
totally denies that she is writing a panegyric.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_87_">[[87]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
But, Theophylact, later archbishop of Ochrid, in an oration delivered perhaps
early in 1088, which primarily dwells on </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius'
</a></span></b><span face="Times">military
exploits, devotes some time to a eulogy of Anna Dalassena, and her reorganisation
of the morals and good order of the palace. He describes Anna with </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">
as the 'two great suns in the firmament of empire', confirming </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="annacom.html">Anna
Comnena's</a></span></b><span face="Times"> account of the way in which
her father wanted it to be seen that he shared the government with his
mother as a single entity. Indeed, just as in the 1081 chrysobull, Theophylact
praises the prayers and tears with which Anna Dalassena had ensured Alexius'
victories.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_88_">[[88]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
The oration is also evidence for the fact that, even in the late 1080s,
the empress Irene was totally eclipsed in the palace by the public eminence
of her mother-in-law, despite the fact that she had already born three
children, including a son, John, who was just a baby.</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">Anna was still governing for her son during his absence
on campaign in 1095: it was she who gave the order to Cyminianus, the
<i>droungarius</i>
of the fleet, to arrest and blind the rebel pretending to be Leo (or Constantine)
Diogenes, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="romaniv.html">Romanus
IV's</a></span></b><span face="Times"> son, and bring him back to Constantinople.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_89_">[[89]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
And if we need external evidence of the way her political importance was
perceived outside of Constantinople, Pope Victor II (1055-1057) had earlier
addressed her in a letter as his 'dear daughter', prayed for her and her
family, and reminded her to remember Rome as her 'first mother'.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_90_">[[90]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Moreover, Guibert of Nogent, one of the more obsessively anti-Byzantine
historians of the First Crusade, whose account, written c. 1108, draws
both on oral and written sources such as the <i>Gesta Francorum</i>, gives
us the intriguing detail that 'the emperor's mother' was a sorceress (or
fortune-teller) who foretold that Constantinople would be attacked and
taken by one of the Frankish leaders (Guibert suggests that this leader
was most probably meant to be Bohemond). This particular reference to Anna
Dalassena surely stems from an eye-witness entertained at the Byzantine
court during the time of her pre-eminence or shortly afterwards, and shows
that she was considered important enough to become part of the anti-Byzantine
oral tradition.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_91_">[[91]]</a></span></b>

<p><b><span face="Times">The Pious Empress</span></b></p></center>

<p><span face="Times">Apart from the assets she controlled as the head
of a large wealthy and propertied household, </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">
ensured that his mother had financial resources appropriate to her rank
and status. She was given the <i>sekreton</i> or 'income' of the Myrelaion
monastery in the capital, the financial prerogatives of which she kept
for herself, in the same way as </span><span face="Times New Roman,Times">Maria
Sclerena</span><span face="Times">, mistress of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="connieix.html">Constantine
IX</a></span></b><span face="Times">, had benefited from the <i>sekreton</i>
of St George at Mangana. Appropriately, the Myrelaion monastery, now the
Bodrum Camii in Constantinople, had housed the wife and daughter of</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="isaacicom.html">
Isaac I Comnenus </a></span></b><span face="Times">after his abdication,
and several members of the imperial family had been buried there. Anna
Dalassena was especially noted for her gifts and generosity to monastic
institutions, and her most noted foundation was the church and monastery
of the Saviour Pantepoptes ('Who sees all') in Constantinople, where she
retired, and was presumably buried. Although it was a male establishment
Anna had had private apartments built there for herself especially for
her retirement. In June 1087 she approved a document (<i>pittakion</i>)
concerning the property assigned to this foundation.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_92_">[[92]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
The Pantepoptes monastery is generally identified with Istanbul's Eski
Imaret Camii which has a beautiful site overlooking the Golden Horn.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_93_">[[93]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Her patronage of other institutions generally took the form of government
grants of land and exemptions from tax; there are documents making grants
to the monks of the monastery of Docheianou on Mount Athos,</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_94_">[[94]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and exemptions from taxes to St Christodoulos' monastery on Patmos; a copy
of this <i>pittakion</i> for Christodoulos of Patmos survives, dated to
May 1088, and was recorded by a certain Michael Machetarios.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_95_">[[95]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">Anna Dalassena is described by her granddaughter
as having been a most formidable lady: 'her outward serenity, true reflection
of character, was respected by angels but terrorised even the demons, and
pleasure-loving fools, victims of their own passions, found a single glance
from her more than they could bear  She knew exactly how to temper reserve
and dignity.'</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_96_">[[96]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">

the palace and the timetable of its daily routine. In moves reminiscent
of an earlier empress, <b><a href="/pulcheria.html">Pulcheria</a></b>,
sister and regent of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="theo2.html">Theodosius
II</a></span></b><span face="Times">, the whole imperial palace now developed
a monastic ethos: love intrigues (like those in the time of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="zoe.html">Zoe</a></span></b><span face="Times">
and<b> <a href="connieix.html">Constantine IX Monomachus</a></b><a href="connieix.html">)</a>
were banned, and there were set times for hymns, regular hours for breakfast,
and a special period for duties such as choosing magistrates.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_98_">[[98]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="annacom.html">Anna Comnena</a></span></b><span face="Times">
makes much of her grandmother's charitable donations, and especially her
hospitality to monks and clerics. Monks could always be found at her dinner-table
and she honoured monks and priests above all other persons, ensuring that
revered holy men were part of the Comnenian network and integral to their
power-base.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_99_">[[99]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
In the later eleventh century saints and holy men had an unparalleled role
in the formation of political policy and were important propagandists for
the current regime. Significantly, Anna Dalassena's 'clients' within the
church included Eustratius Garidas (who was to become patriarch at her
insistence and who had 'prophesied' Alexius' rise to the throne), St Christodoulos
of Patmos, and St. Cyril Phileotes. John the Oxite, a monk before he became
patriarch of Antioch c. 1089-1100, also wrote a short eulogy of her.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_100_">[[100]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">Cyril, in particular, was Anna Dalassena's spiritual
father, and the life of this saint records that, early in the reign of
<b><a href="mikevii.html">Michael
VII</a></b>, he like Eustratius Garidas had foretold </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">'
accession. On this occasion he was on a visit to Constantinople to a noble
Comnenian lady 'who was not yet empress' and who was noted for her love
of monks; we must naturally assume that this was Anna Dalassena. Cyril,
who originated at Philea north of the capital, was noted for his rigorous
asceticism and the breadth of his travels, frequently journeying to Constantinople
and going as far as Chonae and Rome. During his visit, he provided Anna
at her request with spiritual advice suited to her abilities, citing a
series of short quotations from the church fathers (such as Basil of Caesarea,
John Climacus and the desert father Barsanuphius), and advised her of the
necessity of frankness to one's spiritual advisor. She gave him rich gifts,
which he distributed to the poor.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_101_">[[101]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
This was not the end of their association and Cyril was also visited for
advice by a number of notables during Alexius' reign, including </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius'</a></span></b><span face="Times">
general Eumathius Philocales and Irene Ducaena's brother and brother-in-law,
Michael the protostrator and George Palaeologus.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_102_">[[102]]</a><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">,
Irene and all their family also came to consult the saint in a lengthy
visit in or after 1091, and treated him with great reverence.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_103_">[[103]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Under </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius
I</a></span></b><span face="Times"> Cyril's monastery at Philea and its
possessions were confirmed as free from all treasury obligations and Cyril
was to die at a ripe old age in 1110.</span>
</p><p><span face="Times">As well as monks and priests, penniless relatives
and strangers found a welcome in Anna Dalassena's house, and in her personal
devotions she wore herself out with continual prayers and vigils, spending
a large part of the night in chanting hymns.</span><b><a href="#N_104_">[[104]]</a></b><span face="Times">
Her regular place of worship was the church of St Thecla, which had been
founded by her brother-in-law </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="isaacicomn.html">Isaac
I Comnenus </a></span></b><span face="Times">(an interesting choice considering
her attitude at his abdication).</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_105_">[[105]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
There was no escaping the unmistakable fact of her monastic commitment:
even on the day of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius'</a></span></b><span face="Times">
coronation, Anna appeared in her black monastic habit with no imperial
insignia.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_106_">[[106]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
However much she actually enjoyed running the empire, it was publicly made
clear that her real wish was to spend her remaining years in contemplation
and prayer, and it was only her love for her son and his need for her assistance
in ruling the empire that dissuaded her from retiring from the world after
his accession.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_107_">[[107]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
In other words, however good she was at organising the empire's economy,
it was appropriate that she should not appear to want to overshadow her
son, the emperor. After all, it was only at his insistence that she was
giving him a helping hand.</span>
</p><center>
<p><b><span face="Times">Retirement and death</span></b></p></center>

<p><span face="Times">It is quite remarkable that Anna Dalassena wielded
such influence over her son for so many years. Although he needed a reliable
regent, and had essentially owed the throne to his mother and her intrigues
(not to mention her prayers),</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_108_">[[108]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
for her to have remained powerful for some fifteen or more years after
his accession, until he was nearly forty years of age, almost defies belief.
But, with middle age, the time had come for him to rule his own empire.
In the 1090s </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">
was able to spend more time in the capital and perhaps became tired of
his mother's hold on the administration, however efficient this had proved
to be. This is suggested by Zonaras, who shows Anna as having remained
in power for so long that </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius
</a></span></b><span face="Times">became
frustrated by the fact that he was emperor in name alone.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_109_">[[109]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
As a result Anna, who realised his dissatisfaction with the situation,
decided to go before she was pushed, and so retired as a nun to the apartments
attached to her monastic foundation of the Saviour Pantepoptes. The germs
of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius'</a></span></b><span face="Times">
unhappiness may even be seen as early as 1089 in the document for the monastery
of Docheiariou, in which </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></span></b><span face="Times">
appears to disapprove of her generosity to the institution.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_110_">[[110]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">We are unsure both about the year of Anna's retirement,
and that of her death. </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="annacom.html">Anna
Comnena</a></span></b><span face="Times"> is remarkably silent about her
grandmother's disappearance from the palace and it has been suggested that
this silence is due to the fact that her grandmother was involved in something
questionable</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_111_">[[111]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
-- perhaps a heretical sect, such as that of the Bogomils. The Armenian
source Matthew of Edessa records under the year 1089 that a Latin monk
(accompanied by a dog to whom he offered his prayers) corrupted large numbers,
including the emperor's mother, but this dating cannot be correct: we know
that she was still wielding power in 1095, even if she retired shortly
afterwards.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_112_">[[112]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
The crusade tradition, recorded by Guibert de Nogent, that Anna Dalassena
was a 'sorceress', implies that she may still have been in the palace when
the leaders of the First Crusade passed through the city in late 1096 and
early 1097, perhaps retiring not long after their departure.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_113_">[[113]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Whatever the date of and reason for her retirement, Zonaras records that
she resided 'imperially and with honour' at her institution for several
years, dying in 'extreme old age' just over a year before her son Isaac,
who passed away between 1102 and 1104. The date of her death was 1 November
(she is commemorated on this date in the typikon of the Theotokos Kecharitomene
monastery, founded by Irene Ducaena) at some date between 1100 and 1102.
Ironically her death took place on the day (wrongly) forecast by an Athenian
astrologer for the death of</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">
Alexius </a></span></b><span face="Times">himself: at least the prophecy
was correct in so far as a great ruler did pass away on that day.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_114_">[[114]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">Anna's retirement has also to be seen in the context
of the burgeoning Comnenian dynasty. The males of the family had been spending
considerable time on campaign up to the early and mid 1090s, while the
younger women of the imperial family were heavily preoccupied with pregnancy
and child-bearing: Anna Dalassena herself had had eight children; Irene
Ducaena was to have nine; Irene of Georgia eight; </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johncomn.htm#N_xx">Piroshka-Irene</a></span></b><span face="Times">,
wife of John II Comnenus, another eight -- the palace during these decades
was filled with mothers and young children.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_115_">[[115]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">Irene Ducaena's nine children were born over little
less than fifteen years: </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="annacom.html">Anna</a></span></b><span face="Times">
(1083),</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_116_">[[116]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">

and Zoe (1098): both Michael and Zoe sadly seem to have died shortly after
birth.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_124_">[[124]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Not surprisingly, bearing in mind the troubles of pregnancy and early childhood,
Anna Dalassena was in charge until at least the mid-1090s. But with the
end of childbearing and the adolescence of their older children the younger
female members of the imperial family were at liberty to turn their attention
to other matters. Irene of Georgia's last child was born in 1096, and Irene's
Ducaena's in 1098. From 1105, when her youngest surviving child was nine,
the 'young' empress-consort regularly accompanied her husband </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius
</a></span></b><span face="Times">on
campaign.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_125_">[[125]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
With their increasing family, too, particularly the birth of </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius'</a></span></b><span face="Times">
first son and heir </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="johncomn.html">John</a></span></b><span face="Times">
in 1187, Irene's influence over </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius
</a></span></b><span face="Times">must
have been growing, though the Anemas conspiracy of 1102 is the first time
we hear of her having a direct influence on political events.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_126_">[[126]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">Under the Comneni, not only did imperial women retain
their role as legitimators of new rulers and dynasties by marriage and
adoption, but they founded monastic institutions, patronised churchmen
and theologians, and took part in politics more actively than ever before:
pre-eminent in such roles were Anna Dalassena and </span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="maryal.html">Maria
of Alania</a></span></b><span face="Times">, both of whom, incidentally,
were nuns.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_127_">[[127]]</a></span></b>
</p><p><span face="Times">There is no inherent paradox in an autocrat appearing
in the guise of a little old lady in a black dress.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_128_">[[128]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Queen Victoria (Empress of India) and Maria Theresa (Empress of the Holy
Roman Empire) -- who both remained in permanent mourning for their husbands
-- are evidence enough of the truth of this observation. It could even
be argued that, as with Anna Dalassena, the overt piety and conservativism
of these two matriarchs contributed in great measure to the absolute power
they wielded, and fuelled the stability and popularity of their dynasties.
Furthermore their perceptions of their own importance within their families
and households constructed the way they were to view their empires. Over
both they insisted on total control and possessed absolute attention to
detail whether in microcosm or macrocosm.</span><b><span face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#N_129_">[[129]]</a></span></b><span face="Times">
Anna Dalassena was made in the same mould. She was not born to a throne,
but had no doubts that one should belong to her family by right. Having
acquired one, after more than a decade of political intrigue, it was clear
to both herself and her family that the more tricky details of government
were best left in her hands. Perhaps it is this -- the awe and veneration
in which she was publicly held by her adult sons -- rather than just her
political and administrative skills, that makes her unique among Byzantine
empresses.</span>

The institution's name (the 'All-seeing' Saviour) was highly appropriate,
not only because of the monastery's unrivalled view over the Golden Horn,
but also because of Anna's own eagle-eyed approach to every detail of palace
life and administration. She would instinctively have placed a high value
on divine omniscience.

all memories of immorality and misbehaviour at court: if her daughter-in-law,
Irene of Georgia, <i>had</i> been Constantine IX Monomachus' official mistress
in the mid 1050s, this would have been an additional reason why the earlier
promiscuous lifestyle in the palace should be deliberately swept under
the carpet.

anxious to receive them in the palace, considering any house sanctified
that received a monk (ch. 47.9-10, 232-3). Alexius made a second visit

</p><p><a name="N_115_"></a>[[115]] It is an unresolved question to what extent
Byzantine women nursed their own children -- the evidence seems equally
in favour of maternal breast-feeding and the employment of a wet-nurse.
Children were generally weaned at the age of two or three years, and it
seems probable that imperial duties would have necessitated the employment
of nurses (who would, however, have had to have been closely supervised
by the mother): on this, see Joelle Beauchamp, 'L'allaitement: mère
ou nourrice?,'

important at all social levels: as noted by Terry Pratchett, on several
occasions in his <i>Disc-world</i> series (Corgi, 1983--), whole economies
have been based on the lifting power of eighty-year old grandmothers in
black dresses.
</p><p><a name="N_129_"></a>[[129]] Queen Victoria had nine children; Maria
Theresa fourteen (four boys and ten girls including Marie Antoinette).
The incredibly detailed and frequent letters of both to their children
and grandchildren not only show a thirst for every kind of information,
but advise (indeed instruct) on every detail of their lives, however personal:
Albert Edward (later King Edward VII), even in his late fifties as Prince
of Wales, was terrified of his mother Queen Victoria if he were late for
dinner, and could be seen hiding behind a pillar until he could nerve himself
to approach her and apologise.
