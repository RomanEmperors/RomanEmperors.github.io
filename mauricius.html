<b>Maurice (582-602 A.D.)</b></h3></center>

<p><img src="/constina.jpg" alt="Coin with the images of Maurice and Constantina (c)1999, Chris Connell">Maurice
and Constantina
</p><p>This officer, born in Cappadocian Arabissus, is one of the most important
emperors of Byantium. In spite of <b><a href="justinia.html">Justinian's</a></b>
great successes, the empire was still largely threatened in three fronts:
in Italy and Spain by the impending loss of the last possessions, by the
invasion of the Avars and the Slavs' seizure of territory in the Balkans,
and by the Persian wars against the Sassanian Empire in the east. Still
in the reign of <b><a href="ticonii.html">Tiberius II Constantinus </a></b>in
581 Mauricius had defeated the Persian Great King Hormizdas IV after a
four-year-long campaign. He married <b><a href="tina.html">Constantia</a></b>,
the emperor's daughter, by whom he had eight children. He took over a bankrupt
state, something which forced him to extreme parsimony, but earned him
a reputation for avarice among the people and the mercenaries.
</p><p>In 584, Byzantium lost Cordoba, its last possession in Spain. He secured
the remaining western territories by establishing the exarchates of Ravenna
and Carthage, where military and civil responsibility were united in one
hand. Thereby Mauricius started down the road from the later Roman Empire
to the middle-Byzantine arrangement by "themes." In the matter of the ongoing
conflict of the imperial church with the so-called "Monophysites" he insisted
on retaining the decisions of the Council of Chalcedon. The historians
John of Ephesus and Michael the Syrian describe the harsh actions of the
emperor against the "Monophysites." In Edessa 400 monks, who refused to
denounce "Monophysitism," were executed.&nbsp; Mauricius was in touch with
the Franks and permitted the patriarch John IV, the "Faster," to designate
himself ecumenical patriarch, something which led to conflicts with popes
Pelagius and Gregory the Great. Gregory in vain begged the emperor not
to do so, as such a move amounted to the emperor's non-recognition of the
Pope.
</p><p>In 593 Gregory negotiated a truce with the Lombards, contrary to the
emperor's desire, and in 598 this truce was secured with the help of the
exarch. The assumption of the title "king" in Italy by the Lombard Autari
in 584 made it clear that an organized power, with which Byzantium had
to reckon, was developing in Italy. Byzantium was completely helpless to
begin with against the invasion of the Avars under their Khan Boyan, who
conquered Sirmium in 582. Following the Avars, the Slavs advanced into
the Balkan peninsula; in 586 they were at the gates of Thessalonike and
in 587 at those of Adrianople, as well as settling in permanently. For
the moment the Avars were kept quiet by paying tribute; campaigns that
lasted years led to no conclusive result; by 600 they were at the gates
of Constantinople, but were nonetheless repulsed by the General, Priscus.
</p><p>During the Persian-Byzantine war of 572-591, Hormizd II in the winter
of 586-87 sent the East-Syrian (Nestorian) Katholikos to Mauricius. He
gave the emperor a creed, which he in turn had had checked out by the Patriarch,
who characterized it as orthodox and without error, and thus they were
able to celebrate the Eucharist together. The emperor was also in correspondance
with Sabrisho I. , the katholikos' successor. As a result of a quarrel
over the throne in the Sassanian Empire, Maurice in 591 intervened in the
circumstances of the East. Chosrau, who had fled to Constantinople, married
Mary, who seems to be Mauricius' daughter and in the same year was reestablished
on his throne, with Byzantine help. The peace treaty guaranteed Byzantium
Armenia and the eastern part of Mesopotamia. The emperor intended to deport
the Armenians who wanted to remain "monophysite." From 591 to 611 there
were two Katholikoi, one on imperial territory and the other among the
Monophysites in Persia. The emperor's success against Persia induced the
Georgians to declare their independence. The Georgian katholikos Kyrion
decided to reattach the Georgian church again theologically to the Eastern-Roman.
The emperor's will in 597 makes clear that he had by no means given up
ideas of universal politics: his son Theodosius was to succeed him in the
East and his son Tiberius in Rome, which was to remain the second capital.
</p><p>The campaign of 593 against the Avars took the offensive across the
Danube for the first time in a long while. When the emperor, out of parsimony,
ordered the troops to winter on the far side of the Danube, the result
was a mutiny, which the officer <b><a href="phocas.html">Phocas</a></b>
took advantage of to seize power in Constantinople, with the help of the
circus-factions and the Senate. Mauricius fled to the asiatic side of the
Bosporus and was murdered, together with his sons, by <b><a href="phocas.html">Phocas'</a></b>
partisans. His <b><a href="tina.html">widow</a></b> and their three daughters
survived by dint of entering a convent. A senseless mutiny led to the fall
of an important ruler, who was followed by a regime of terror which was
at the end to lead to a political disaster. The beheaded bodies seem later
to have been interred in the cloister of Mamas in Constantinople. Chosrau
II used the murder of his father-in-law as an excuse for a war of conquest
against Byzantium, which lasted for one year.
</p><p>The main source for the time of Mauricius is the history of Theophylact
Simocatta. The emperor left behind him an extensive military handbook,
<i>Strategikon</i>,
in twelve books, in which he made use of his military experiences. Plans
for the recruitment of a peasant militia, which should replace the mercenary
armies, are here discussed. Particularly the eleventh book with its characterization
of enemy peoples (Franks, Lombards, Avars, Turks, and Slavs) is of ethnographical
interest. The handbook also belongs to legal literature, since it contains
a list of military delicts and their appropriate punishments. It cannot
be decided whether the emperor himself edited the work or merely initiated
it. The emperor was considered a promoter of learning and,&nbsp; in the
Orthodox Church,&nbsp; is venerated as a saint.
