<h3>Theodosius II (408-450 A.D.)</h3>
<h3>Geoffrey S.  Nathan</h3>
<center>University of California- Los Angeles</center>
<p></p>
<h3>Early Life and Reign</h3>
<p>Theodosius II was born to the eastern emperor <a href="arcadius.html"><b>Arcadius</b></a> and the empress Aelia Eudoxia in April
of 401.  As Eudoxia had produced three girls prior to this time, Theodosius' birth was received
with considerable excitement, both by his family and by the broader 
population of Constantinople.  He was baptized and crowned Augustus in January of the following year to enthusiastic crowds.<b><a href="#N_1_">[[1]]</a></b> 
Unlike his father, about whose early life we know practically nothing, Theodosius' youth is well-attested and it was spent preparing him for his future imperial duties.  From what we can tell of his
education, the young emperor was not trained to be the passive figurehead his father largely was.</p>
<p>He began, as did most upper class youths, in the <em>cursus</em> of classical education, with grammarians
and later rhetoricians. He was apparently bilingual and showed a thirst for learning.  The young
emperor particularly enjoyed editing and correcting manuscripts.  As he grew older and succeeded
his father as sole ruler of the east in 408, Theodosius was instructed in the more martial skills of
horsemanship, swordplay and perhaps other military arts as well.  His eldest sister, Pulcheria, who
would gain great importance after the end of Anthemius' career, oversaw his moral education: 
orthodoxy, philanthropy and asceticism were all part of the curriculum.  Pulcheria also taught
Theodosius the subtleties of being emperor:  how to physically comport oneself, how to control
emotion, and how to deal with ministers and aides.  Given his sister's piety, it is probable that the
young man was also kept isolated from women.  Theodosius' education, in sum, was training for
an active, involved Christian emperor.<b><a href="#N_2_">[[2]]</a></b></p>
<p>But like his father before him and his uncle <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius</b></a> in the west, Theodosius' youth at accession
meant that he would be unable to ever effectively assert himself later in his reign.  The Persian King,
Isdigerdes, had briefly inserted himself into Roman affairs by threatening war if any but
Theodosius succeeded his father, a plan apparently devised by <a href="arcadius.html"><b>Arcadius</b></a>.  The young Augustus was
quickly accepted, but the Praetorian Prefect, Anthemius, continued to dominate political affairs as
he had in the last years of <a href="arcadius.html"><b>Arcadius'</b></a> reign.<b><a href="#N_3_">[[3]]</a></b>  In part due to the acceptance of Isdigerdes' role as
guardian, Rome and Persia remained at peace until the Great King's death in 421.</p>
<p>Anthemius meanwhile continued his work at mending fences with the west.  When the western
generalissimo, Stilicho, was assassinated, relations between the two halves of the empire improved
considerably.  <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius</b></a> and Theodosius shared the consulship in 409 and Constantinople even
sent 4,000 troops to help guard Ravenna and <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius</b></a> against the Visigoths.<b><a href="#N_4_">[[4]]</a></b>  While this gesture proved
fruitless, the east and west now worked more closely than they had since the death of
<a href="theo1.html"><b>Theodosius I</b></a>.</p>
<p>Anthemius also set about making Constantinople more defensible.  In 413, he completed a circuit
wall that enclosed most of the city and established a crucial water supply.  Events since the 370s
had proved the hinterlands unsafe:  Illyricum, Thrace and other Balkan provinces had been
repeatedly overrun by Germanic and Hunnic peoples.  Indeed, as recently as 408, the city had
been threatened by a group of Huns under the leadership of Uldin.  He had been defeated, but the
memory of that and other raids spurred Anthemius' building projects.<b><a href="#N_5_">[[5]]</a></b></p>
<p>After 414, however, Anthemius fell off the political map and we can assume that he died.  It is
possible, however, that Theodosius dismissed the Prefect.  If that is the 
case, it perhaps indicates the degree to which new powers at court now 
gained influence over the emperor.  The young man increasingly came
under the control of Pulcheria, who began to insert herself into public life.<b><a href="#N_6_">[[6]]</a> </b> Whatever the reason,
by mid-414, the young woman had risen to dominate the still underaged emperor.</p>
<h3>The Regency of Pulcheria</h3>
<p>Edward Gibbon once wrote of Pulcheria: "she alone, among all the descendants of the great
Theodosius (I), appears to have inherited any share of his manly spirit and abilities."<b><a href="#N_7_">[[7]]</a></b>  Even before
she took full control of her younger brother, she had shown herself a powerful force:  in 412, at
the age of 15, she had convinced Theodosius to dismiss the chamberlain (<em>praepositus</em>), Antiochus,
who had been overseeing the imperial household since the days of <a href="arcadius.html"><b>Arcadius</b></a>.  In the following
year, Pulcheria had consecrated herself to perpetual virginity and likewise exhorted her two sisters
to do the same.  It was a vow she would not break, even when she married the emperor, <a href="marcian.html"><b>Marcian</b></a>,
thirty-seven years later.  More immediately, however, it gave her enormous moral authority to
oversee the upbringing and education of the young emperor.</p>
<p>No sooner had Anthemius disappeared than Pulcheria completed her ascendancy by having herself
made Augusta in July of 414.  She may have gotten help from Aurelian, who
was named Praetorian Prefect of the east shortly thereafter.
<b><a href="#N_8_">[[8]]</a></b>  With or without his help, the young 
woman's bid was successful.  So that there be no 
question of her authority, an official portrait in
Constantinople was dedicated in the following year, depicting <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius</b></a>, Theodosius II and
Pulcheria.  And by denying her capacity for childbirth, she offered a new conception of female
power in the public sphere, based on sanctity and the cult of the imperial mystique.<b><a href="#N_9_">[[9]]</a></b></p>
<p>Her authority manifested itself in a strongly pro-orthodox administration.  Pulcheria, in her
adolescent brother's name, passed laws against Jews, pagans and heretics.  For the first time,
pagans were officially banned from holding public office and serving in the military.<b><a href="#N_10_">[[10]]</a></b>  This would
set an important precedent in the following century for ostracizing other undesirables.  Her
movements against Jews and their religion were particularly onerous:  one early constitution
ordered an end to the building of synagogues and the destruction of existing ones in places where
there would be little or no resistance.<b><a href="#N_11_">[[11]]</a></b>  It was also under Pulcheria's stewardship that the murder
of the popular pagan philosopher, Hypatia, occurred in Alexandria at the hands of
Christians, encouraged, no less, by the archbishop, Cyril.  Her order was brutal and barbaric, but
the imperial court let it go unpunished.  To what degree this decision represented Theodosius'
acceptance is difficult to establish, but clearly he did not strenuously object to this pro-active
policy of asserting Christianity as the proper belief of the empire. </p>
<p>Apart from educating Theodosius in the arts of statecraft and heavily imbuing him with Christian
morals, Pulcheria made it her business to find her younger brother an appropriate spouse.  Such
arrangements would have normally been carried out by a mother or father, but since they were
both deceased, the job fell to the eldest sibling.  Traditionally, Pulcheria was thought to have
picked an appropriate wife for her younger brother.  The chosen girl, Athenaïs, was young,
intelligent, and well-educated by her philosopher father.  She herself was a poet of some repute. 
Although poor, Athenaïs converted to Christianity, took the name Aelia Eudocia, and married
the young emperor in June of 421.<b><a href="#N_12_">[[12]]</a></b>  Recent scholarship has suggested, however, that Eudocia
was less the choice of Pulcheria than she was the candidate of many of the disenfranchised
aristocrats of the eastern empire.<b><a href="#N_13_">[[13]]</a></b>  Indeed, the two women's subsequent disagreements and
Eudocia's eventual disgrace implied that there was considerable competition for prestige and
authority.</p>
<p>Pulcheria's most visible influence on state policy came during the ecumenical council held at
Ephesus in the summer of 431.  Trying to settle once and for all christological issues surrounding
God's nature, the council condemned the Nestorian controversy, which had presumed that Christ
had two separate persons -- one human, one divine -- in his incarnation.  Pulcheria engineered
opposition against Nestorius (who was the patriarch of Constantinople at the time), not so much
because of his objection to the Nicene creed, but because of his rejection of the increasingly
important Mother of God (<em>Theotokos</em>) movement.  Nicaea was upheld, Nestorius was deposed
and exiled, and Nestorianism was declared heresy.  Pulcheria had used Cyril of Alexandria and
other bishops to gain control of the religious debate in the capital and the eastern Empire.</p>
<p>In other areas of government, Pulcheria's hand rested more lightly.  Military affairs and
administrative changes were for the most part left to the experts.  
Helion, for example, was made Master of Offices (<i>magister officiorum</i>)
and  held the post for thirteen years.  Nevertheless, even after the emperor's
majority, the Augusta's presence was always felt:  we know little of Helion's magistracy other
than he seems to have been a competent minister.  Nor did her power ebb after her brother's
death:  it was Pulcheria, after all, who lent legitimacy through marriage to Theodosius' successor,
<a href="marcian.html"><b>Marcian</b></a>.</p>
<p>The only real threat to her dominance over Theodosius came in the person of the emperor's wife. 
Aelia Eudocia had at first tried to build a faction of loyal officials around her, including her uncle
Asclepiodotus, and sought to pursue more moderate religious policies.<b><a href="#N_14_">[[14]]</a></b>  She also apparently
bore the emperor three children, although only <a href="eudox.html"><b>Licinia Eudoxia</b></a> survived.<b><a href="#N_15_">[[15]]</a> </b> But such power
proved transitory and slowly Pulcheria came back to the fore with her persecution of the
Nestorians.  The marriage of <a href="eudox.html"><b>Licinia</b></a> to 
<a href="valenIII.html"><b>Valentinian III</b></a> in 437 only reinforced 
the struggle: Pulcheria gained by virtue of her own Theodosian blood, but
Eudocia also gained as mother of the bride.</p>
<p>In the late 430s, the two struggled directly for dominance over the emperor's favor.  As with
Pulcheria's rise to power, the <em>augustae</em> chose the religious sphere to assert their control.  The
emperor's sister oversaw the return of John Chrysostom's relics to Constantinople and lobbied
for the passage of new strict anti-pagan and anti-Jewish legislation.<b><a href="#N_16_">[[16]]</a></b>  As a means of reasserting her own
standing, Eudocia went to the Holy Land on pilgrimage with the famous ascetic, Melania the
Younger, and returned in 439 with important relics and enormous prestige.  With the help of the
sword-bearer (<em>spatharius</em>), Chrysaphius, she sought to have Pulcheria removed from court.  While
this plot had some limited success, the eunuch soon turned on Eudocia and engineered <em>her</em> fall through
rumors of adultery.  Theodosius' wife once again left the capital, this time permanently.  In the late
440s, she eventually took up the monophysitic cause.<b><a href="#N_17_">[[17]]</a> </b> Thus, Pulcheria may have won the struggle,
 bust she had lost the prize: Theodosius was no longer under her influence.</p>
<h3>Foreign Relations</h3>
<p>Theodosius' foreign policies centered around three axes:  relations with the Persians, the
encroachment of the Hun confederation under Rua and later Attila, and the precarious balance of
power in the Mediterranean.  In all three areas, the emperor and his ministers showed themselves
to be occasionally adept, but for the most part unable to deal effectively with the rapid changes
occurring around them.</p>
<p>Persian relations were good for the first years of Theodosius' reign.  Isdigerdes' sponsorship of the
emperor at his accession and his apparently moderate attitudes towards Christianity assured
amicability between the two empires until the Great King's death in 421.<b><a href="#N_18_">[[18]]</a></b>  But with his death and
the accession of his son, Vararanes V, hostilities broke out again.  The new king allegedly began a
persecution of Christians, and some Roman citizens were harassed.  The king embarked upon a
campaign against Rome's eastern territories, but was very quickly defeated by several able
generals, including one Germanic officer, Ardabur.  Having been defeated on all fronts, the
Persians and Rome signed the One-Hundred-Year Peace, which was supposed to recognize each
nation's borders and keep them largely demilitarized.<b><a href="#N_19_">[[19]]</a></b>  Despite several infractions of that peace,
including one in 440-441 with the accession of Isdigerdes II, the treaty remained largely
unviolated for the rest of the fifth century.  Not until 502 did a major confrontation between Rome
and Persia erupt into war.</p>
<p>Of much greater concern were the steppe-dwellers of central Asia, the Huns.  As nomadic
horsemen, they rarely recognized central authority and thus had not represented a concerted threat
to Rome's security.  But under Rua, who successfully united the smaller tribes under his rule, they
were able to directly affect the overall state of the Empire.  Early in Theodosius' reign, a large
contingency of Huns under Uldin had attacked Thrace.  Although defeated, this first major
sojourn into imperial territory presaged things to come.  Despite repeated attempts to fortify the
Balkan hinterlands against incursions of foreign invaders, the court at Constantinople found it politically expedient to
deal with Hun aggression more directly; thus sometime in the mid-420s, the first annual indemnity,
amounting to 350 pounds of gold, was paid to Rua.  </p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, Rua died and was replaced by his even more able nephew, Attila (and Attila's
brother, Bleda), who immediately demanded the doubling of the annual tribute to 700 pounds of
gold and forced Theodosius' government to sign a treaty that was highly advantageous to the
Huns. In 441, while Theodosius was engaged in campaigns against the Persians and the Vandals in
the west, Attila made new demands on the government.  When they were refused, the king
plundered and sacked cities along the Danube.  The Roman army was defeated and in 443, an
even more humiliating treaty and tribute was forced upon the court.  Now the annual tribute stood
at 2,100 pounds of gold, with an additional punitive payment of 6,000 pounds due immediately. 
In 448, the demands were again raised and met by the Empire.  By the time of Theodosius' death,
the eastern empire's resources were near exhaustion.</p>
<p>For fifteen years, then, Constantinople had been forced into a policy of accommodation.  Many in
the government had been responsible for accepting the extortion, although many more opposed
any payments at all.  In 449, Chrysaphius -- now chamberlain (<em>praepositus</em>) and in effective control
of the eastern empire -- plotted Attila's murder.<b><a href="#N_20_">[[20]]</a></b>  Although it failed and created even greater
attempts to please the Huns, it represented the first serious attempt to oppose Hunnic hegemony. 
Since the eunuch had probably been one of the main architects of appeasement, his plot no doubt
signified the degree of desperation felt in the empire.</p>
<p>Despite these threats from the east, however, western affairs dominated Theodosius' foreign
policy.  Strong ties remained between Theodosius and his uncle, <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius</b></a>, and later his cousin,
<a href="valenIII.html"><b>Valentinian III</b></a>.  When <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius</b></a> died in 423 and a pretender, <a href="westemp5.htm#Note 9"><b>Ioannes</b></a>, tried to assume the purple in
Ravenna, Theodosius sent a force under Ardabur to force recognition of his cousin, <a href="valenIII.html"><b>Valentinian</b></a>.
<a href="galla.html"><b>Galla Placidia's</b></a> regency for the six-year-old emperor assured Theodosian legitimacy.  Theodosius
even recognized posthumously <a href="westemp5.htm#Note 8"><b>Constantius III</b></a> (<a href="galla.html"><b>Galla Placidia's</b></a> husband) as <em>Augustus</em>.   The
two emperors would eventually share four consulships together.</p>
<p>Nor was the east's support strictly symbolic.  On two occasions, Theodosius sent large forces to
aid the west against Vandal incursions.  The first was an army in 431, led by Ardabur's son, Aspar,
in an attempt to stop King Gaeseric's advance into the African provinces.  Along with the count of
Africa, Boniface, Roman forces were badly beaten and retreated to Carthage.  The defeat
emboldened the Vandals to take most of the rest of North Africa by 439.</p>
<p>Gaeseric's successes led to attacks on Sicily and the Italian coast.  They laid siege to Palermo and
may have taken Lilybaeum.<b><a href="#N_21_">[[21]]</a></b>  Theodosius once again sent a large naval force against the Vandals
in 441, with several initial successes.  But perhaps through Gaeseric's diplomacy, the Persians
chose at this time to attack Rome's eastern borders.  Attila, too, saw the opportunity for
aggression.  Theodosius was forced to conclude a hasty treaty in 442.  The agreement recognized
the Vandals' holdings as a separate, independent kingdom in formerly Roman territory.  This was
symbolically a significant event:  before this time, Germanic peoples had accepted settlement in
Roman territory as official allies (<em>foederati</em>) of the empire.  The treaty made manifest to all that
Rome was no longer master of its own domain.</p>
<p>In all these dealings, Theodosius and his ministers did the best they could to deal with a series of
crises happening throughout Europe and western Asia.  The eastern half of the Roman Empire
was able to weather them, the west was not.  In sum, to survive, the government in
Constantinople was forced to redefine its place in the world.</p>
<h3>Legal and Administrative Programs</h3>
<p>It was during the reign of Theodosius that the first great pandect of Roman law was published,
with direct participation from the emperor himself.  In the age since <a href="dioclet.html"><b>Diocletian</b></a>, when the last
comprehensive law code had been issued, a large number of general constitutions had been
published by both eastern and western emperors.  Many were no longer salient to modern-day
concerns, and many more were unworkable or contradictory.  There was an additional problem of
harmonizing the law codes of the east and the west, and creating a process by which each half of
the empire could recognize one another's laws.</p>
<p>In March of 429, Theodosius set up a commission to take all existing laws from the late third
century onward and arrange them in such a way as to present a completely new and current code
of jurisprudence.  Theodosius seemed less interested in getting rid of potential conflicts than he
was in providing completeness and creating a truly comprehensive law.<b><a href="#N_22_">[[22]]</a></b>  After six years, an
initial edition was completed in 435, but was not published.  A new commission was appointed,
headed by a lawyer from Antioch, Antiochus Chuzon, to improve the language and create a
system by which the code could be further emended and enlarged.  In February of 438, the <em>Codex
Theodosianus</em> was published and presented to the Senates in Rome and 
Constantinople, which both received the work with apparent enthusiasm.  
Consistent with his desire to make the code an expandable document, 
Theodosius himself issued several supplementary laws (<i>novellae</i>).</p>
<p>The code had enormous influence, both in itself and in future legal history.  It proved to be the basis for
the emperor <a href="justinia.html"><b>Justinian's</b></a> much more ambitious judicial reforms in the following century.  The
Visigothic king, Alaric II, also incorporated large parts of Theodosius' work into the <em>Lex Romana
Visigothorum</em> in 507.  The code is probably the only major accomplishment during Theodosiusí
reign that can be directly attributed to his influence.</p>
<p>The emperor's administrative reforms were also aggressive, although their results were mixed.  In
the 420s and 430s the emperor and his ministers, perhaps because of fiscal pressures, enacted
fiscal policies that attempted to bring more revenue into the imperial coffers.  One such policy was a
much more forceful collection of rents on imperial lands granted to lessees, another discontinued
the extensive tax exemptions held on large tracts of land, and still another attempted levy wealthy
taxpayers in gold coin.<b><a href="#N_23_">[[23]]</a></b>  In the last case, the levies were in direct response to the increasing
monetary demands of the Huns.  The emperor also tried to cut down on the sale of offices, which
was a ubiquitous problem at all levels of government.<b><a href="#N_24_">[[24]]</a></b>  Subsequent legislation of the same sort
in the following centuries suggests that such measures were not altogether successful.</p>
<p>These fiscal policies went hand-in-hand with Theodosius' legal work.  Theodosius moved towards
greater administrative control by reserving the issuance of grant deeds of imperial lands to the
very highest of offices.<b><a href="#N_25_">[[25]]</a></b>  Such moves were 
part of a broader centralization of authority in the eastern Rome and helped
create the apparatus of the Byzantine state.</p>
<h3>Final Years and Assessment</h3>
<p>On July 28, 450, Theodosius II fell from his horse in an accident and died shortly thereafter. 
On his deathbed, he purportedly named <a href="marcian.html"><b>Marcian</b></a> as his successor.<b><a href="#N_26_">[[26]]</a></b>  Whether or not this was the
case, Marcian was crowned emperor less than a month later in the hippodrome.</p>
<p>The emperor's death could not have come at a more confusing time.  Since the emperor had
produced no male issue, there was no clear heir to the throne.  From his immediate family, only his
sister, Pulcheria, survived in the eastern Empire.  Moreover, following the attempted assassination
of Attila, both Romans and Huns were deeply suspicious of one another.  The past twenty years of
Hun extortion had also drained the imperial treasury.  In the west, despite strong support for
<a href="valenIII.html"><b>Valentinian</b></a>, Theodosius was unable to keep the Vandals from consolidating their gains in the
Mediterranean.  Gaeseric was willing and able to take up further wars when opportunity
presented.</p>
<p>Finally, the religious victories of orthodox Christians were temporarily thrown into disarray by
Theodosius II himself.  Calling a general council at Ephesus in 449, usually called the Robber
Council or <i>Latrocinium</i>, it favored the christological stance of Eutyches and his
supporters.  He argued the monophysitic position that Christ had only one nature and it was
divine.  Matters were made worse by the deposition and subsequent death 
of Constantinople's patriarch, Flavian.  The decision to support his 
beliefs caused widespread dissent in Constantinople, insulted
and alienated the west in the person of Pope Leo I, and represented the first major split between
eastern and western Christendom.</p>
<p>In the end, Theodosius II had a small enough legacy given the length of 
his reign aside from his legal initiatives.  His studied and
visible piety would become a model for future emperors, and his Theodosian blood kept civil wars
practically non-existent.  For that, the east enjoyed considerable internal stability.  But his reign
also marked the clear shrinking of Rome's empire and its influence.  Future emperors were forced
to deal with a western empire politically disintegrating and a Mediterranean that was no longer
<em>mare nostrum </em>("our sea").  Much of the following fifty years helped to create the empire of
Byzantium.  Theodosius II's quiescence helped in no small part.</p>
<h3>Bibliography and Notes</h3>
<p>There are a large number of primary sources, both religious and secular, that deal with the reign of
Theodosius II.  They include the ecclesiastical histories of 
Sozomen (ed. J. Bidez and G.C. Hanson; 1960), Evagrius(ed. J. Bidez and 
L. Parmentier; 1898), Theodoret(ed. F. Scheidweiler; 1954),  and
Socrates(ed. R. Hussey, 1853); the fragmented secular histories of 
Olympiodorus and Priscus (ed. C. Mueller, iv; 1870);  and later historians 
such as Philostorgus (ed. J. Bidez; 1913),  Marcellinus Comes 
(ed. T. Mommsen; 1894),  John Malalas (ed. L. Dindorf; 1831),  and 
Theophanes (ed. C. de Boor; 1883).    There are also church
chronicles detailing the religious events of his reign, particularly the 
<em>Chronicon Paschale</em> (ed. L. Dindorf; 1832).    The
<em>Acta</em> of the Council of Ephesus also survive (ed. J.D. Mansi; 
1759-1798).    The <em>Codex Theodosianus</em> contains a large number of
the emperor's legal enactments as well as an excellent description in the opening sections of the
pandect's inception and presentation (ed. T. Mommsen and P. Krueger; 
1905).    The <em>Codex Justinianus</em> also contains a number of laws 
from the emperor's reign (ed. P. Krueger; 1877).  </p>
