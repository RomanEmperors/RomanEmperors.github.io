<h3>
Early Life and Public Career</h3></center>

<p><br>Any discussion of Decius (and for most third century emperors) must
be prefaced by an understanding that the historical tradition is incomplete,
fragmentary, and not wholly trustworthy. Any reconstruction of his life
and reign will therefore be to some degree speculative.&nbsp; With that
caveat in mind, Gaius Messius Quintus Decius was born, to a provincial
yet aristocratic Senatorial family during the transitional Severan age,
possibly in 201.<b><a href="#N_1_">[[]1]]</a></b> His family may have been
from Italian stock, although that is by no means certain.<b><a href="#N_2_">[[2]]</a></b>
Attempts to describe his life previous to the consulship are problematic,
although he did serve as governor in Moesia in the mid-230's.<b><a href="#N_3_">[[3]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That also means that Decius probably had been a member of the Senate for
some time. We know little else about his early life, other than at some
point he married&nbsp;<a name="Note Z"></a>Herennia Cupressenia Etruscilla,
apparently from the Senatorial
<i>ordo</i> as well.<b><a href="#N_4_">[[4]]</a></b>&nbsp;
His political fortunes rose in the troubled 240's. As instability grew
in the mid-third century, <b><a href="philarab.html">Philip the Arab</a></b>
charged Decius, suffect consul for 249, with restoring order along the
Danubian frontier.<b><a href="#N_5_">[[5]]</a></b> In addition to the border
unrest, a low-level army officer, <b><u><a href="philarab.htm#Note 2">Tiberius
Claudius Marinus Pacatianus</a></u></b>, had led a rebellion of the armies
in Pannonia and Moesia.<b><a href="#N_6_">[[6]]</a></b> For a short time,
Marinus apparently claimed the imperial purple and along with movements
of the Gepidae, represented a clear threat to the stability of <b><a href="philarab.html">Philip's</a></b>
rule.<b><a href="#N_7_">[[7]]</a></b>
</p><p><b><a href="philarab.html">Philip's</a></b> decision to send Decius was
perhaps more motivated by political expediency than by any great confidence
in his military abilities.<b><a href="#N_8_">[[8]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Decius had an aristocratic pedigree, and so was likely to have been a popular
choice with a Senate that was increasingly doubtful of<b><a href="philarab.html">
Philip's</a></b> abilities.<b><a href="#N_9_">[[9]]</a></b> He was also
a native of Sirmium in Pannonia Inferior, and so was likely familiar with
the intricacies of life and politics in the region.<b><a href="#N_10_">[[10]]</a></b>
Finally, he had, of course, served as governor of the wayward province,
and thus undoubtedly had connections there among the civil and military
<i>curia--</i>ones
that <b><a href="philarab.html">Philip </a></b>hoped Decius could exploit.
Thus, the consul was charged with restoring order along one of the Empire's
most problematic borders. Accompanied by his son, <b><a href="hehost.html">Herennius</a></b>,
Decius traveled to Moesia, probably to reclaim the <i>Legio IV Flavia Felix</i>
and possibly the <i>Legio XI</i>, both of which were stationed in that
province.<b><a href="#N_11_">[[11]]</a></b>
</p><p>Shortly before his arrival, <b><a href="philarab.htm#Note 2">Marinus</a></b>
was killed and local troops quickly named Decius emperor, encouraging him
to assert this newfound responsibility in a war against <b><a href="philarab.html">Philip.
Philip's</a></b> inability to deal decisively with the worsening military
crises on the borders, the fear of punishment, and the opportunity for
enrichment no doubt motivated the soldiers to place the purple on a local
leader--a now increasingly common practice. Decius' lineage also probably
appealed to traditionalists in Rome, who begrudged <b><a href="philarab.html">Philip</a></b>
his humble origins and his possible involvement in the death of <b><a href="gordo3.html">Gordian
III</a></b>.<b><a href="#N_12_">[[12]]</a></b> <b><a href="philarab.html">Philip</a></b>
led out an army in June of 249 to meet his newest rival for the purple
and at an unknown location (possibly Verona or Beroea) lost the battle.<b><a href="#N_13_">[[13]]</a></b>
Whether <b><a href="philarab.html">Philip</a></b> died in the fighting or
was assassinated by his own troops--another increasingly common practice--is
unknown. <b><a href="philarab.html">Philip's</a></b> son, <b><a href="philarab.htmNote 6">Philip
Junior</a></b>, recently made an Augustus, was quickly put to death by
the Praetorian Guard in Rome.<b><a href="#N_14_">[[14]]</a></b> Decius
was the first emperor to come from the Balkans region. How much he wanted
to serve is unknown.&nbsp;&nbsp; While this account undoubtedly contains
fictional elements, with several popular literary <i>topoi</i>, the rough
outlines of the story are undoubtedly true:<b><a href="#N_15_">[[15]]</a></b>
we have epigraphic evidence in July for support among the Pannonian <i>Legio</i>
X, suggesting that Decius owed his accession in no small part to local
troops<b><a href="#N_16_">[[16]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<h3>
Publicity and Power</h3></center>
The victory of an established Senatorial aristocrat was one that seemed
to reassert the authority and place of traditional political power, despite
the means of Decius' ascension. The new emperor, no doubt aware of the
perils of his position, seems to have embarked upon a highly conservative
program of imperial propaganda to endear himself to the Roman aristocracy
and to the troops who had thrust the purple upon him. One of his earliest
acts was to take the honorific name of Trajan, whose status as the greatest
of all emperors after Augustus was now becoming firmly established.<b><a href="#N_17_">[[17]]</a></b>
The fact that <b><a href="trajan.html">Trajan</a></b> had commanded legions
in Upper Germany and had close links to both Pannonia and Moesia at the
time of <i>his</i> accession invited the comparison. The name was cleverly
chosen: <b><a href="trajan.html">Trajan</a></b> had been an active and successful
general throughout his reign, but had also established a reputation for
a widely popular civil government.
<p>Decius also served as consul in every year of his reign and took for
himself traditional republican powers, another way to underscore his authority
and conservatism. He even tried to revive the long defunct office of censor
in 251, purportedly offering it to the future emperor, <b><a href="gallval.html">Valerian</a></b>.<b><a href="#N_18_">[[18]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Decius moreover portrayed himself as an activist general and soldier. In
addition to leading military campaigns personally, he often directly bestowed
honors upon his troops, high and low alike.<b><a href="#N_19_">[[19]]</a></b>
He also holds the dubious distinction of being the first emperor to have
died fighting a foreign army in battle.&nbsp; Finally, in 250, he associated
his sons <b><a href="hehost.html">Herennius</a></b> and <b><a href="hehost.html">Hostilianus</a></b>
in his rule by making them Caesars, eventually raising the former (and
elder) to Augustus.<b><a href="#N_20_">[[20]]</a></b> Undoubtedly, Decius
sought to create a dynasty in much the same way the Gordians had in the
previous decade.&nbsp; This traditionalism may to be a large extent, however,
a construction rather than a reality. When we abandon the literary tradition
and look instead at other forms of evidence, his imperial aims are less
clear. The legal record, extremely thin, is only vaguely supportive of
a conservative policy: most of his surviving enactments deal with private
law issues consistent with earlier Severan jurisprudence.<b><a href="#N_21_">[[21]]</a></b>
</p><p>On the other hand in late 249, when Decius returned to Rome, he embarked
upon an active building program in the capital. After a destructive fire,
he extensively restored the Colosseum. He later commissioned the opulent
Decian Baths along the Aventine. He perhaps also was responsible for the
construction of the Decian Portico.<b><a href="#N_22_">[[22]]</a></b> Such
activities contrasted to a twenty-year period of relative building inactivity.
Both the kind of building projects and their stylistic qualities suggest
an attempt to recall the glories of the past. The numismatic evidence also
suggests some degree of traditionalism. It is there that we see the first
references to Trajan Decius, as well as an association with both Pannonia
and Dacia.<b><a href="#N_23_">[[23]]</a></b> His <i>Liberitas</i> and <i>Uberitas</i>
issues, combined with his wife's <i>Pudicitia</i> and his son's <i>Princeps
Iuventi</i> coins, all seem to rearticulate traditional ideology.<b><a href="#N_24_">[[24]]</a></b>
Legends tend to be conservative, so this hardly surprising, but there were
no great innovations to suggest a new set of ideological principles.&nbsp;
In sum, while the literary reconstructions of Decius' life are problematic,
it seems clear that traditionalism was an important factor in his administration,
especially in the wake of <b><a href="philarab.html">Philip's</a></b> reign.
</p><center>
<h3>
The Persecution of Christians</h3></center>
Another possible aspect of this conservatism was a reported wide-scale
attack on the growing Christian minority. The third century saw the slow
creation of sizeable communities in the Empire's urban populations. For
the first time, if we are to believe Christian sources, an Empire-wide
persecution of Christians was begun under Decius.<b><a href="#N_25_">[[25]]</a></b>
The state required all citizens to sacrifice to the state gods and be in
receipt of a <i>libellus</i>, a certificate from a temple confirming the
act.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rationale for the emperor's actions, however, is not
entirely clear. Eusebius writes he did so because he hated <b><a href="philarab.html">Philip</a></b>,
who purportedly was a secret Christian.<b><a href="#N_26_">[[26]]</a></b>
Probably the enmity was real, but it seems unconnected to the introduction
of these policies. More likely, if Decius did indeed seek to persecute
Christians, he was reacting to the growing visibility of the religion,
especially in the city of Rome itself. One of the more prominent martyrs
of the age was Fabian, the bishop of the imperial capital.<b><a href="#N_27_">[[27]]</a></b>
<p>But the new policy of public religiosity was much more probably a program
to reassert traditional public piety, consistent with some of the other
conservative initiatives introduced during the emperor's short reign. The
<i>libelli</i>
themselves were largely generalized in nature and language, and there is
no implication that they were directed at any one group<i> per se</i>.<b><a href="#N_28_">[[28]]</a></b>
Whatever intended effect it may have had on Christianity was thus to a
degree unplanned.<b><a href="#N_29_">[[29]]</a></b> Christians would have
no doubt seen it differently. It is possible then that fourth and fifth
century Christian polemicists have misinterpreted (whether purposefully
or not) Decius'
<i>libelli</i>. In the particular cases of Eusebius and
Lactantius, both wrote in the wake of the great persecution of <b><a href="dioclet.html">Diocletian</a></b>
and no doubt magnified upon the theme of the tyrant-persecutor. A hostile
tradition notwithstanding, the new requirements did impact Christians most
acutely, causing considerable division in the growing ranks of the new
religion.<b><a href="#N_30_">[[30]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<h3>
Imperial and Military Problems</h3></center>
Like other third century emperors, Decius was not free of threats to his
authority, either from within or without. The revolt of <b><a href="philarab.htm#Note 3">Jotapianus</a></b>,
either in Syria or Cappadocia, had actually begun in <b><a href="philarab.html">Philip's</a></b>
reign, but was quickly quelled after Decius' accession.<b><a href="#N_31_">[[31]]</a></b>
Probably the usurper's own soldiers murdered the would-be emperor, since
the accounts state that his body was delivered to Decius while still in
Rome in the summer of 249.
<br>A potentially more serious revolt broke out while Decius was out of
Rome in 250 fighting the Goths.&nbsp;<a name="Note B"></a>Julius Valens
Licinianus, also a member of the Senatorial aristocracy with some popular
support, took the purple at the Empire's capital.<b><a href="#N_32_">[[32]]</a></b>
It appears to have been relatively short-lived grab for power, ending in
a few days with his execution<b><a href="#N_33_">[[33]]</a></b>.&nbsp;<a name="Note C"></a>The
governor of Macedon, Titus Julius Priscus, also permitted himself to be
proclaimed Augustus at Philippopolis towards the end of 251, probably with
Gothic collusion.<b><a href="#N_34_">[[34]]</a></b> The Senate declared
him a public enemy almost as soon as he chose usurpation.<b><a href="#N_35_">[[35]]</a></b>
He probably survived Decius, but is likely to have perished when <b><a href="trebgall.html">Gallus</a></b>
became emperor.<b><a href="#N_36_">([[36]])&nbsp; </a></b>Of greater concern
than sporadic rebellions, which were relatively minor, were the vitreous
northern borders. For the first time, a new and aggressive Germanic people,
the Goths, crossed into and raided Roman territory in the 250's. At the
time of Decius' forced accession, the Gepidae and the Carpi were both raiding
deep into the Moesian provinces. They, along with the Goths, raided Pannonia
and Dacia as well. Decius was forced to fight campaigns each year of his
reign, doing his best to keep the borders stable.
<p>His final campaign in 251 led to the death of his son, <b><a href="hehost.html">Herennius</a></b>,
and to his own. Decius led a successful attack on the Carpi, pushing them
out of Dacia. But Moesia Inferior had been left largely undefended and
Cniva, king of the Goths, led a sizeable portion of his army into the province.<b><a href="#N_37_">[[37]]</a></b>
The emperor, after chasing the Germanic force around the region, engaged
Cniva's forces outside of Philippopolis, which had been recently been sacked
by the king and held by the rebel, Priscus. It was here that his elder
son was slain by an arrow and the emperor, seeking to reassure his troops,
famously proclaimed that the death of one soldier was not a great loss
to the Republic.<b><a href="#N_38_">[[38]]</a></b> Cniva then led his troops
homeward, laden with the spoils of war.&nbsp; The loss became Decius' undoing.
<b><a href="trebgall.html">Trebonianus
Gallus</a></b>, one of the emperor's commanders, may have revolted, although
it is not entirely clear.<b><a href="#N_39_">[[39]]</a></b> Instead of
regrouping his forces and re-securing the borders, Decius unwisely sought
to chase down Cniva before he left Roman territory. His decision may have
been motivated by his son's death (despite his insistence otherwise) or
it may have been an attempt to salvage what had been a failed campaign.
In either case, it was ill-advised.
</p><p>It was at <b><a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;ahbc324.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=528,height=475&quot;)">Abrittus</a></b>,
about 100 kilometers northeast of Nicopolis that Decius finally met his
death.<b><a href="#N_40_">[[40]]</a></b> Hoping to cut off Cniva's escape
route (and perhaps minimize any help from <b><a href="trebgall.html">Gallus</a></b>),
Decius' army was itself cut off in the marshy terrain. The details are
sketchy, but Cniva divided his seventy thousand man army into three groups
and surrounded the emperor's force. On July 1<sup>st</sup>, the emperor
and most of his troops were slain. In the aftermath, the survivors named
<b><a href="trebgall.html">Trebonianus
Gallus</a></b> emperor, a decision subsequently confirmed by the Senate.&nbsp;
Some contemporaries called the death tragic; others heroic. An Altar of
Decius was erected where the emperor fell, still apparently famous two
centuries later.<b><a href="#N_41_">[[41]]</a></b> Decius and <b><a href="hehost.html">Herennius</a></b>
may have even been deified.<b><a href="#N_42_">[[42]]</a></b> Christian
polemicists, as might be expected, took pleasure in describing Decius'
body being stripped and left on the battlefield to be devoured by animals.<b><a href="#N_43_">[[43]]</a></b>
Whatever else, his was the first death of an emperor at the hands of an
enemy of Rome.&nbsp; But even the account of his death, along with that
of his son, must be looked on suspiciously. Their deaths bring to mind
the sacrificial <i>devotiones</i> of the famous Republican Decii father
and son, P. Decius Mus senior and junior.<b><a href="#N_44_">[[44]]</a></b>&nbsp;
The circumstances of Decius' death, therefore, are perhaps as opaque as
those of his accession.
</p><center>
<h3>
Assessment</h3></center>
In spite of gaining some modicum of praise from both ancient and modern
observers, Decius' reign was not well-suited to the demands of a rapidly
changing empire.<b><a href="#N_45_">[[45]]</a></b> Conservatism may have
been popular among a certain portion of the Roman elite, but the old aristocracy's

power and influence all but disappeared in the third century. Decius clearly
had a broader vision of what he wanted to accomplish in his reign than
many of his contemporaries, and certainly he was vigorous, but he was also
a man who was not sufficiently flexible when the moment called for it.
His religious policy caused major disruptions in Rome and; in contrast
to some of the other barracks emperors, Decius proved himself less than
apt when dealing with Rome's Germanic foes. His death may have been heroic,
but it was unnecessary and unsuccessful. This best sums up Decius Trajan's
reign.

<h3>
Ancient Sources</h3></center>

<p><br>Relatively little remains about Decius' reign. If there were a biography
of Decius in the <i>SHA</i>, it no longer survives, although there are
scattered references to his rule in the biographies of Claudius II Gothicus
and Aurelian. Zosimus, i:21-23, Aurelius Victor, 29-30, Zonaras 12, Eutropius
9, Jordanes <i>Get.</i> 17-8, and Sylvius Polemius 37-40 have brief accounts
of his reign. There are fragments in John of Antioch, <i>fr.</i> 148 and
Dexippus, <i>fr.</i> 18. Eusebius, vi:39-41, vii:1, 11, 22, and viii:4,
discusses his persecution, and there are passing references to his persecution
in Socrates and Lactantius. Inscriptions and coinage are relatively abundant;
see note 21 below for several epigraphic references.

</p><p><a name="N_1_"></a>[[1]] In 251 at his death, Decius was purportedly
fifty years of age; Syl. Pol. 40. Much of the surviving statuary and coinage
shows a man of advanced age.

</p><p><a name="N_3_"></a>[[3]]See most recently Kienast (1990):203-5. <i>RE

a full recounting, which is not entirely trustworthy: xv:1251<i>f.</i>

</p><p><a name="N_7_"></a>[[7]]Marinus may have been trying to associate himself
with Philip, judging from the few coins that survive; <i>RIC</i>4:3:104-5.
</p><p><a name="N_8_"></a>[[8]]Although Zosimus implies that Decius already
had some amount of military experience; i:21:3.
</p><p><a name="N_9_"></a>[[9]]There are ample references to the Decii <i>gens</i>
in the literary and epigraphic record. See <i>RE,
</i>xv:1251-2, although
the connection between Decius and the Republican
<i>gens</i> is doubtful
at best.
</p><p><a name="N_10_"></a>[[10]]Aur. Vic. 29:1. Another tradition places his
home in Budalia (<i>Barrington</i>21, <b>B5</b>), approximately 15 kilometers
west of Sirmium; Eutr. 9:4.
</p><p><a name="N_11_"></a>[[11]]See <i>OCD3</i>, 841-2. Since most of Decius'
military operations were in Dacia, which had no known permanent garrison
at the time, and Moesia, it stands to reason that he made use of troops
in that province.
</p><p><a name="N_12_"></a>[[12]] <i>HA Gordian</i> 29-30; Zos. 1:18.
</p><p><a name="N_13_"></a>[[13]]John An. (<i>FHG</i> iv) fr. 148, has suggested
the latter, although Zos. i:21:2 and Zon. 12:19 suggest Verona. See Pohlsander
(1986).
</p><p><a name="N_14_"></a>[[14]]Zos, i:21:2, however, states that he was with
his father.
</p><p><a name="N_15_"></a>[[15]]For the importance of the rhetoric, Syme (1971):198-9.
</p><p><a name="N_16_"></a>[[16]]<i>CIL</i> iii:4558.
</p><p><a name="N_17_"></a>[[17]]The date of this decision was unclear, but
since he is styled <i>Traianus</i> by 250 on coinage suggests it was early.
On Trajan's growing popularity Bennett (1997). Already by the third century,
the Senate wished each new emperor on accession: "May you be luckier than
Augustus and better than Trajan;" Eut.. <i>Brev</i>. 8:5:3.
</p><p><a name="N_18_"></a>[[18]] S.H.A., <i>Val.</i> 5-7. Valerian was <i>princeps
senatus</i> (president of the Senate) at the time; <i>SHA</i> Gord. 9:7.
</p><p><a name="N_19_"></a>[[19]]He had awarded torques and armbands with his
own hands, once giving a young Claudius II the honor;
<i>SHA </i>Claud.
13:4.
</p><p><a name="N_20_"></a>[[20]]<i>CIL</i> ii:4957, 4958, iii:3746, and 5988.
</p><p><a name="N_21_"></a>[[21]]All but one of his surviving laws are either
directly or indirectly tied to family issues: gift-giving, dowry issues,
testamentary concerns; <i>CJ</i> iv:16:2, v:12:9, vi:30:4, vi:58:3<i>pr.</i>
and 1, vii:32:3, and viii:53:3. Of interest, too, is the relatively short
period in which the laws were issued: with one exception, all were issued
in the second half of 250.
</p><p><a name="N_22_"></a>[[22]]See Bird (1994) 128, n. 4, for building references.

</p><p><a name="N_24_"></a>[[24]]<i>RIC</i> 28, 58b and 59b, 147c. Herennia
Etruscilla's <i>Abundantia</i> issue with the figure of <i>Pudicitia</i>
is a variation; <i>RIC</i> 74.
</p><p><a name="N_25_"></a>[[25]] It is perhaps noteworthy that Zosimus, an
exaggerated proponent of traditional paganism and highly critical of Christianity,
fails to mention this event. In fact, outside of Christian sources, we
have no record of a comprehensive persecution.
</p><p><a name="N_26_"></a>[[26]]Eus. <i>Hist</i>., vi:39.
</p><p><a name="N_27_"></a>[[27]]He was also apparently one of the earliest,
being executed in January of 250; Kelly (1986), 16-7.
</p><p><a name="N_28_"></a>[[28]]Knipfling (1923):389-90.
</p><p><a name="N_29_"></a>[[29]]See Pohlsander (1986) for a broad assessment.
</p><p><a name="N_30_"></a>[[30]]Socrates notes that the origins of the Novatian
movement came out of the persecution; <i>Hist. Eccl.</i> iv:28. It also
indirectly encouraged the growing
<i>homooisian-homoousian</i> controversy;
v:19.
</p><p><a name="N_31_"></a>[[31]]For Syria, Aur. Vict. 29. On Jotapianus' revolt,
Zos. i:21:3 and 22:2. For the revolt in Cappadocia, see Zos. i:20:5 and
Polemius Sylvius 37-8.
</p><p><a name="N_32_"></a>[[32]]Aur. Vic. 29:5; <i>Epit</i>. 29:3.
</p><p><a name="N_33_"></a>[[33]] See Bird (1994)129-30, n. 7. The story is
further confused by the claim that Valens had ruled in Illyricum;
<i>SHA</i>
TT 20. It seems likely that the author of the
<i>Thirty Tyrants</i> either
mistakenly or purposefully confused Julius Valens with Julius Priscus.
</p><p><a name="N_34_"></a>[[34]] Polemius Sylvius 39-40. On the possible help
or advocacy of the Goths, see Jor. <i>Get</i>. 18; <i>cf.
</i>Dexippus,
fr. 18.
</p><p><a name="N_35_"></a>[[35]]Aur. Vic. 29:4. Victor's narrative seems to
imply that Priscus died before Decius, but if the Gothic king, Cniva, wanted
to weaken Decius, it makes more sense that he moved against Priscus and
Macedonia after beating the emperor.
</p><p><a name="N_36_"></a>[[36]]Zos. i:24. Ammianus Marcellinus calls them
Scythians, but this is a literary synonym; xxxi:5:15-17.
</p><p><a name="N_37_"></a>[[37]]Jordanes states that Cniva divided his army
in two and took one half into Roman territory for the raids; 18.
</p><p><a name="N_38_"></a>[[38]]Aur. Vic. 29:5; Jordanes 18. Again, this statement
may be literary artifice, given the nature of the sources.
</p><p><a name="N_39_"></a>[[39]]Zosimus claims that he rebelled, in collusion
with Cniva; i:23:2. But both Jordanes and Aurelius Victor's accounts
</p><p><a name="N_40_"></a>[[40]]<i>Barrington</i>22,
<b>D5</b>.
</p><p><a name="N_41_"></a>[[41]]Jor., <i>Get</i>. 18.
</p><p><a name="N_42_"></a>[[42]] Eutropius 9:4. This is not repeated elsewhere
and there is no archeological evidence to support Eutropius' statement,
but is quite possible.
</p><p><a name="N_43_"></a>[[43]]Lact. <i>Mor. Pers.</i>4, quoting Jer<i>.
</i>22:19
and 36:30.
</p><p><a name="N_44_"></a>[[44]]Livy, viii:9 and x:28. See Bird (1994):130,
n. 10.
</p><p><a name="N_45_"></a>[[45]]Aur. Vic. 29:3, 30.2;

Decius was also one of the few emperors in the third century crisis (along
with Claudius II and Aurelian, to be deified; Eut.,
<i>Brev.</i> 9:4. Modern
proponents have included Gibbon, v. 1, 206-18; Syme (1971), 199; and Alföldi
(1939), 166-8.
