<h3>Probus's Background 
</h3>
<p>M. Aurelius Probus was most likely born in Sirmium in 232 A.D. It is difficult to reconstruct Probus' career before he
became emperor because of the unreliable nature of the account in the <em>Historia Augusta</em>, but it is
certainly possible that he was a tribune under <a href="gallval.html"><b>Valerian</b></a>.  Perhaps all that can be said with any
reliability is that he served in the military and  was on <a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian's </b></a>staff during his Eastern
campaigns.<b><a href="#N_1_">[[1]]</a></b>    There is a certain amount of confusion in the sources about him because of the fact
that he has often been confused with a certain Tenagino Probus,  who served as
prefect in Egypt under <a href="claudgot.html"><b>Claudius II Gothicus</b></a>.<b><a href="#N_2_">[[2]]</a></b></p>
<h3>Accession to Power</h3>
<p>After the murder of <a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian</b></a>, the Senate chose as his successor the
septuagenarian senator, <a href="tacitus.html"><b>Tacitus</b></a>, who took up the burdens of state and headed with the army to
the East.   The Eruli had  overrun Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia and finally Cilicia, where <a href="tacitus.html"><b>Tacitus</b></a>, with
help from his half-brother <a href="florian.html"><b>Florianus</b></a>, defeated them.<b><a href="#N_3_">[[3]]</a></b>    <a href="tacitus.html"><b>Tacitus</b></a>, however,  either died of an illness
or was killed  by his own troops;  he was succeeded by  <a href="florian.html"><b>Florianus</b></a>.<b><a href="#N_4_">[[4]]</a></b>
In the meantime, Probus had been declared Emperor by his own troops in 
mid-276, and prepared to meet <a href="florian.html"><b>Florianus</b></a>, who was marching from the Bosporus,
having broken off his victorious engagement against the Eruli.  <a href="florian.html"><b>Florianus</b></a>
was acknowledged in Rome and was supported by Gaul, Spain, Britain, and Italy;
Probus was supported by Syria, Phoenicia, Palestine and Egypt.  The two
fought a desultory campaign near Tarsus.  With a much  smaller force, Probus decided his best
strategy would be to avoid a pitched battle and let the heat overcome the troops of <a href="florian.html"><b>Florianus</b></a>.
The latter, having reigned  barely two months, was murdered by his own troops.<b><a href="#N_5_">[[5]]</a></b>  Probus became
sole Emperor, possibly by August 276.<b><a href="#N_6_">[[6]]</a></b></p>
<h3>Probus in the West: 276-279 </h3>
<p>His first order of business was to punish the murderers of <a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian</b></a>, who
may have also had a hand in the murder of <a href="tacitus.html"><b>Tacitus</b></a>.<b><a href="#N_7_">[[7]]</a></b>
On the basis of numismatic evidence, Probus appears to have  traveled from the
east across the Propontis, and then through the provinces of Thrace, Moesia
and Pannonia.  It is at this time that he must have defeated the
Goths because he already had the title <em>Gothicus </em>by 277 A.D.  Shortly after he
arrived at the Rhine River he made a trip to Rome to have his powers
ratified by the Senate.<b><a href="#N_8_">[[8]]</a></b></p>
<p>Following the death of <a href="postumus.html"><b>Postumus</b></a> in 258, the situation in Gaul had rapidly
deteriorated and numerous bands of invaders had swept across the Rhine.
In the south, the Longiones, together with the Alamanni, had advanced 
through the Neckar valley into Gaul. The Franks had crossed the Rhine further
north. In order to meet this simultaneous threat, Probus divided his forces 
having his generals campaign against the Franks, while he himself fought against the Longiones
and Alamanni.   Both Probus and his generals were victorious; in fact, Probus even
captured Semnon, the leader of the Longiones, with his son.  Both
groups of invaders agreed to terms and booty and prisoners were
returned; in the end, Probus allowed Semnon and his son their freedom. </p>
<p>Probus is next reported to have fought victoriously against the Burgundians and to have
 secured his victory with some ingenuity. Because  his forces were smaller than those of
the invaders, he wanted to engage the enemy on terms as favorable as possible;
the Romans were on one side of the river and the barbarians were on the
other. Probus was able to induce them to cross the river by having his
soldiers hurl insults at them, and being enraged, they began crossing the
river. Before the barbarians were able to organize themselves, the Roman army
soundly routed them.  Smarting from their defeat, the enemy did
not live up to their end of the treaty, with the result that, in a second battle, they were again
worsted by Probus.<a href="#N_9_"><b>[[9]]</b></a> The barbarians who were taken prisoner were enrolled in the Roman Army
and sent to Britain.</p>
<p>Not content with merely defeating the barbarians along the Rhine, Probus
took important steps to secure the boundary for the future. He planned and
constructed a series of forts and depots on the German side of the Rhine at
various crossing points, which he garrisoned with troops.  Further, Probus
apparently took measures to restore economic stability to Gaul by
encouraging the planting of vineyards.  Probus' titles  <em>Gothicus Maximus</em> and
<em>Germanicus Maximus</em> suggest claims to the success of his operations in the area.<b><a href="#N_10_">[[10]]</a></b></p>
<h3>Events in the East 279-280</h3>
<p>The sources do not give many details of Probus's activities in Raetia and
Illyricum, but Zosimus does say he repulsed an invasion of Vandals from
Illyricum in a battle along a river generally identified as the Lech.   
In 279, theatre of operations was
Lycia. Zosimus records the curious story of the adventures
and death of a robber chieftain name Lydius who may be the same individual
called Palfuerius in the <em>Historia Augusta</em>.   In order to prevent further
troubles, Probus constructed fortresses, and settled
large groups of veterans in this area, giving them land in exchange for the
promise that their sons would also serve in the legions when they were old enough.<a href="#N_11_"><b>[[11]]</b></a></p>
<h3>Probus's Military and  Economic Activities In Egypt</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, Probus had sent his generals to Egypt, where the
Blemmyes were stirring up trouble in 280;  they
 had broken through the border, advanced up the Nile, and, in league with the
city of Ptolemais, captured the city of Koptus.   They were eventually expelled 
and order was restored by Probus' generals.  Once Probus had restored order,
he set about the task of a large-scale  reconstruction of the dikes, canals,
and bridges along the Nile, something which not been done since it had been undertaken
by Augustus in the years 27-25 B.C. More specifically, the <i>Vita Probi</i>
notes, "On the Nile, moreover, he did so much that his sole efforts added greatly to the
 tithes of grain.  He constructed bridges and temples porticos and 
basilicas, all by the labour of the soldiers, he opened up many 
river-mouths, and drained many marshes, and put in their place 
grain-fields and farms"(9.3-4).  The importance of this type of work cannot be 
underestimated since a large percentage of the food supply for Rome came from Egypt
and the African provinces.<a href="#N_12_"><b>[[12]]</b></a></p>
<h3>The Revolts of Proculus, Bonosus, and Saturninus</h3>
<p>According to the <i>Historia Augusta</i>, although the Persian King, Vahram II, had made peaceful overtures, Probus
had rejected these and was planning to push the war forward when he was
faced with a series of revolts both in the West and East.  It is
difficult to place them in their exact time-frame since the sources do not
agree. Nevertheless, the situation was serious enough for Probus to 
cancel his plans for war with Persia and hurry back to the West. On his return
Probus settled large numbers of barbarians in the Empire.<a href="#N_13_"><b>[[13]]</b></a>   Perhaps this
was done to repopulate areas which had been left abandoned by the effects of
invasions and plague. This policy, which Probus did not begin, and
which was continued by his successors was, however, destined to
bring trouble to Rome in the future.</p>
<p>The writer of the <i>Vita Probi</i> in the <i>Historia Augusta</i> indicates that in 280 A.D. <a name="Note 2"></a>Proculus revolted in the vicinity of the city of Lugdunum,
which had been severely dealt with by <a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian</b></a> and, for reasons not given,
spurred on by this fear, had adopted a hostile attitude towards Probus.
 Proculus apparently  had some connections to the Franks 
and he had hoped to rally them to his cause. They appear, however, to have handed
him over to Probus when he arrived on the scene.<a href="#N_14_"><b>[[14]]</b></a> 
 Probably at the same time, <a name="Note 3"></a>Bonosus revolted.
His  rebellion  seems to have been serious as it appears to have required considerable force to be suppressed.
 Bonosus, an officer in charge of the Rhine fleet, 
had somehow let the Germans slip over the border and burn the fleet.
Fearful of retribution, he apparently took  shelter in proclaiming himself emperor. 
He was, in spite of his lapse with the fleet, an excellent soldier. The fighting was only
stopped when Bonosus, despairing of his position, hanged himself.   Probus
spared the lives of his sons as well as that of his wife.<a href="#N_15_"><b>[[15]]</b></a></p>
<p><a name="Note 3"></a>Julius Saturninus, one of Probus 's commanders in Syria, probably 
seized power  in the year 281.  A close
friend and associate of Probus, he may have been compelled to adopt
the purple by his unruly troops.   Although he initially rejected a request 
of the people of Alexandria to put on the purple, he later changed
his mind and proclaimed himself Augustus. In any case, Probus planned to put down the rebellion. However, Saturninus was killed by his own
troops before Probus had a chance to act.<a href="#N_16_"><b>[[16]]</b></a></p>
<p>The sources do not provide  much in the way of material to analyze the
extent of these revolts and how widespread the feeling was against Probus
in the West. There are indications that the revolts were more than local
affairs because  inscriptions from as far away as Spain have been found where
Probus's name has been erased.<a href="#N_17_"><b>[[17]]</b></a></p>
<p>In 281 Probus was in Rome to celebrate his victories.  Although the  
<i>Historia Augusta</i> goes into great detail to describe the events of  Probus s 
triumph and celebrations of his victories in respect to the  number of animals
and prisoners involved, there may be some truth to its  description because 
Zosimus states there was a uprising which at this time required a force 
of soldiers to suppress. On a more substantial note, Probus completed 
the wall around Rome  which had been begun by <a href="aurelian.html"><b>Aurelian</b></a>.<a href="#N_18_"><b>[[18]]</b></a></p>
<h3> Probus' Assassination</h3>
<p>Probus was too anxious to push ahead with his plans for an invasion of
Persia, which had been postponed due to the revolts and unrest in the West,
and, to this end, he left Rome in 282 and proceeded first to his native town
of Sirmium when news came that <a href="carus.html"><b>M. Aurelius Carus</b></a>, Perfect of the
Guard, had been proclaimed emperor. When troops sent by Probus to quell 
the rebellion went over to <a href="carus.html"><b>Carus</b></a>, Probus' remaining troops killed the emperor. 
His death occurred sometime between September or
October 282.<a href="#N_19_"><b>[[19]]</b></a></p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p><a name="N_1_"></a>[[1]]For Probus' full name and his year of birth, see Dietmar Kienast, <em>Römische Kaisertabelle:
Grundzüge römischen Kaiserchronologie</em>, (Darmstadt, 1990), 250; Probus' place of birth and
lineage: it is unclear whether his father was a certain Maximus who rose
through the ranks to become a tribune (<em>SHA</em>, <em>Vita Probus</em>, 3.1-2) or a 
certain Dalmatius who was a gardener (Aur. Vict., <i>Epit.</i>, 37.1); W. Henze, <em> RE</em> 2.2, s.v. "Aurelius (194)," col.2517ff;
Probus' early career under Valerian and subsequent emperors through Aurelian: <em>SHA</em>, <em>Vita
Probus</em>, 5.6-7, 6.1ff; Kienast sifts through the farrago of data in the SHA for the reader and
points out what material is worth believing (<em>Römische Kaisertabelle</em>, 250).
</p><p>For the most recent full treatment of Probus' reign, see G. 
Vitucci, <i>L'imperatore Probo.</i> Rome, 1952;  for a more concise and 
recent treatment, see R. Hanslik, <i>Kl. P</i>. 1, s.v. "Aurelius (28)," col. 769.</p>
<p><a name="N_2_"></a>[[2]]The confusion in the <em>Historia Augusta</em>  
may be intentional since Probus is the hero and his
biographer certainly wanted to attribute as many valiant deeds to him 
as he could. The problem is carefully gone over by A. Stein<em></em> ("Tenagino Probus," <em>Klio</em>, 29 [1936],
237-242).  Stein gives documentary evidence for the career of T. Probus as 
well as the name Tenagino (which he says is Etruscan in origin). The 
confusion is also noted in, among other sources, 
A.H.M Jones (<em>The Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire</em>, 
s.v. "Probus (3)," 1.736), T. Barnes, ("Some persons in the <i>Historia 
Augusta</i>," <i>Phoenix</i>, 26[1972],156), and Kienast (<em>Römische Kaisertabelle</em>, 250).</p>

</p><p><a name="N_7_"></a>[[7]]Zosimus indicates  that Probus invited them to a banquet and, while observing
the proceedings from above, then  gave a signal for the soldiers to attack them.(1.65.1-2) It seems,
however, somewhat implausible that they could be so gullible. In Zonaras, Probus rebukes them
in person and later put them to death.(12.29[2.609.1ff]). The author of the<em> Vita Probi</em> (13.2-3) in
the <em>Historia Augusta</em> indicates some retribution was taken upon the murderers. Probus did not,
however, take any action against the followers of Florianus (<em>ibid</em>., 13.3 );   F. Paschoud,<em> Zosime ,

sources and the secondary literature are treated in depth by Paschoud (<i>Zosime</i>,. 1.58, 173, n. 96,
1.59, 175, n. 97); the chronology of these operations is discussed by Vitucci (<i>Probo</i>, 48ff).

he eventually planned to go to war with them (<em>ibid.</em>, 20.1); he may have made peace in order to
deal with the usurpers in the west (<em>ibid</em>., 18.4; Probus and his dealings with the Persians: Henze,<em> RE</em>, 2.2, col.2522ff;  David Magie, <em>Scriptores Historiae Augustae</em>,

Proculus' life should be considered dubious (<em>Römische Kaisertabelle

in passing: Aur. Vict., <em>Caes</em>. 37.3, <em>Epit</em>., 37.2; Eutrop., 9.17.1; although Kienast accepts the
outline of events spelled out in the <em>SHA</em> and apparently the details about his command on the
Rhine and his suicide (15.1-3), he rejects the details contained in 14.1-5 
of the <em>Vita Firmi </em>(<em>Römische Kaisertabelle</em>, 251-252);

Kienast, <em>Römische Kaisertabelle

(2.609.10ff); <em>SHA, Vita Probi</em>, 18.4, <em>Vita Firmi</em>, 7-9; Although Kienast
rejects Saturninus' career which is spelled out in the<em> Vita Firmi</em> at 9.5, he appears to accept the
fact that he was <em>dux limitis Orientalis</em> under Aurelian and 
governor of Syria under Probus (<em>Römische Kaisertabelle
</em>, 253), aspects of his career not accepted by Barnes (<i>Phoenix</i>, 26 [1972], 171ff);
Saturninus' reign is discussed by Vitucci (<i>Probo</i>, 58ff), Lippold 
(<i>Kl. P.</i> 4, s.v. "Saturninus (2)," col. 1570), Stein (<i>R.E.</i> 
2A, s.v. "Saturninus (6)," col.213ff),

and Pomeroy (Sarah B. Pomeroy, "The Revolt of Saturninus", <em>Schweizer Münzblätter,   </em>19 (1969),
54-56); a good survey of the literature and discussion of the chronology of
 the revolt is provided by Paschoud (<em>Zosime</em>, 1.57, 173, n. 95). See 
also A. Chastagnol, "Sur la chronologie des années 275-285" in <i>Festschrift Jean Lafaurie</i> (Paris, 1980), 75-82.

3.378-9, n. 1; according to the <i>SHA</i> (<em>Vita Probi</em>, 21.1-4), a tumult occurred and the
exasperated soldiers pursued Probus to an "ironclad" lookout tower and he
was killed there. Magie notes, " The same account of his death is given in Aur[elius] Victor,<em> Caes</em>. 37,4 and
Eutropius, ix, 17, 2; on the other hand, this version [preserved in Zosimus and Zonaras}...seems more credible....Probus' death took place after 29 Aug., 282 since there are
Alexandrian coins of his eighth year, which began on that day...."(<em>Scriptores Historiae Augustae</em>,
3.378-9, n. 1); Paschoud discusses the chronological problems in the sources surrounding the
dating of Probus' death (<em>Zosime</em>, 1.62, 177-178, n.101).
