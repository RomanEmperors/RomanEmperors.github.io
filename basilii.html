<b>BASIL
II (976-1025)</b>
&nbsp;
<p>Catherine Holmes, University College, Oxford
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p><b>Introduction</b>
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>For Byzantine and modern historians alike the reign of Basil II marks
the apogee of the Middle Byzantine Empire. Between 976 and 1025 Byzantine
territorial and cultural frontiers expanded considerably. Bulgaria was
annexed in 1018. In the east Basil also absorbed the Georgian princedom
of Tao and the Armenian state of Vaspurakan. Towards the end of his reign
Byzantine forces became more active in southern Italy, consolidating and
expanding Byzantine authority in the face of a variety of powers including
the Ottonian emperors of Germany. At the time of his death the emperor
was planning to invade Muslim Sicily. It was also during Basil's reign
that Vladimir, prince of Kiev, converted to Christianity.<b><a href="#N_1_">[[1]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In later centuries Basil the 'Bulgarslayer' came to be compared with the
most prestigious and successful emperors of Late Antiquity. Michael Choniates
writing in the early thirteenth century bracketed Basil with Heraclius
(610-641). Basil's reputation was a powerful propaganda tool for successive
imperial dynasties. The Comnenian emperors in the twelfth century consistently
sought to associate their images with Basil. <b><a href="mikeviiip.html">Michael
VIII Palaeologus</a></b> translated Basil's relics from their original
burial place at the Hebdomon (see below) to his own family monastery near
Selymbria.<b><a href="#N_2_">[[2]]</a></b>
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>Yet, despite this glorious posthumous reputation, Basil experienced
many setbacks during his own lifetime. Civil war was endemic in the first
thirteen years of his adult reign. His long campaign against the Bulgarians
included several heavy defeats. Even after his annexation of Bulgaria,
dissent persisted within Byzantium itself. Moreover, within half a century
of Basil's death, the empire had disintegrated, torn apart by internal
discord and external adversaries. Some historians argue that Byzantium's
collapse in the eleventh century should be attributed to Basil's own overweening
ambition, arguing that the emperor's campaigns overstretched the capacities
of the empire.<b><a href="#N_3_">[[3]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; In what follows
I will argue rather a different case. Despite his fearsome military image,
Basil's approach to government was flexible enough to accommodate his territorial
conquests. The decline that occurred after his death was caused by factors
outside the emperor's own control.
</p><center>
<p><b>Sources</b></p></center>

<p>One of the greatest difficulties facing any historian of Basil's reign
is a very uneven medieval historiographical record. The most substantial
contemporary accounts are by Yahya ibn Sa'id (Arabic) and Stephen of Taron
(Armenian). But these come from the eastern periphery of the empire, are
contained within texts which cover a longer period than the reign of Basil
alone, and are written in languages other than Greek.<b><a href="#N_4_">[[4]]</a></b>&nbsp;
Leo the Deacon is the only contemporary historian of the reign who wrote
in Greek; yet his real interest lay in the reigns of <b><a href="phocas.html">Phocas</a></b>
and Tzimisces and he included only a few pages about Basil before ending
his account in 989/990. Fuller Greek accounts of the reign only surface
in the mid to late eleventh century with the testimonies of Michael Psellus
and John Scylitzes. Neither is particularly satisfactory. Psellus's assessment
is little more than a character sketch of Basil. Scylitzes's testimony
is more substantial but is far from comprehensive. He deals at length with
the early civil wars and Basil's campaigns with Bulgaria, but covers little
else. He makes many chronological and topographical mistakes, mainly as
a result of his fondness for compressing large and diverse bodies of material
into short summary passages. Scylitzes also tends to focus on those individuals
whose families remained famous in his own later eleventh-century lifetime
while marginalising those whose families had died out. He often proves
more interested in didactic moralising than accurate reporting.<b><a href="#N_5_">[[5]]</a></b>
Furthermore, much of his coverage of the early civil wars seems to be drawn
from a source sympathetic to the rebel general Bardas Sclerus; as a result
his text is dominated by the viewpoint of one of the emperor's chief adversaries.<b><a href="#N_6_">[[6]]</a></b>
</p><p>Yet, even when the different narrative accounts of Basil's reign are
aggregated the historian is still faced with problems. The first thirteen
years of the reign are quite fully represented: many texts describe the
revolts of the generals Bardas Sclerus and Bardas Phocas, the deposition
of Basil the Parakoimomenos, warfare with Fatimid Egypt, and Basil II's
disastrous campaign against the Bulgarians in 986. But after 989 the picture
becomes thinner. During the final decade of the tenth century only events
in the east are clearly described. Scylitzes's coverage of the Balkans
is exceptionally piecemeal. A brief description by John the Deacon of the
naval and trading agreement deal struck in 992 between the empire and Venice
lacks diplomatic context.<b><a href="#N_7_">[[7]]</a></b> After 1000 the
record becomes even more exiguous. Until 1014 there is almost complete
silence about Asia Minor, the eastern frontier, and Constantinople itself.
Stephen of Taron's testimony ends in 1004. Yahya only refers to the erratic
behaviour of the Fatimid caliph al-Hakim.<b><a href="#N_8_">[[8]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Scylitzes's material on the Balkans is limited to a few terse and generalised
references to military action. This gloom only lifts after 1014. Yahya
includes more detailed material on Byzantine-Fatimid relations in northern
Syria; Scylitzes presents some vivid snapshots relating to the conquest
of Bulgaria in 1018; many historians from north and south of the Alps chart
the collaboration between the rebel Meles and the Normans in southern Italy
in 1017-18. Finally a series of interlinked events between 1019-1022 attract
widespread attention: the absorption of Vaspurakan; Basil II's campaigns
against the Georgians; and the revolt of Nicephorus Phocas and Nicephorus
Xiphias.
</p><p>Of course alternative written and material sources can be used to supplement
this rather piecemeal historiographical picture. For Basil's wars with
the Bulgarians there is an anonymous later tenth-century military manual,
anecdotes from the advice book of Cecaumenus, the history of the Priest
of Diocleia (which contains traces of the life of a local ruler St Vladimir
of Diocleia), archive materials from Mount Athos, and a variety of hagiographical
materials (including the Lives of Athanasius of the Lavra and Saint Nikon
of Sparta).<b><a href="#N_9_">[[9]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The letters of
Leo of Synada shed light on Byzantine diplomacy with Germany and the Papacy.<b><a href="#N_10_">[[10]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Local monastic archive documents, annals, and several saints lives, including
that of Nilus, a Greek-speaking monk who was spiritual advisor to emperor
Otto III, illuminate events in southern Italy. On the eastern frontier
Yahya and Stephen can be fortified with material from other histories in
Arabic, Syriac, Armenian and Georgian. Particularly important for the civil
wars of Basil's reign is the Georgian <i>Life of John and Euthymius </i>which
outlines the Georgian contribution to the emperor's victory over Sclerus
in 979. The military tactica and letters of Nicephorus Uranus, Basil's
most trusted general in the east, are also useful.<b><a href="#N_11_">[[11]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Heterogeneous materials reflect on the court and imperial administration
in Constantinople: the 'Escorial Tacticon', the 996 novel against the 'powerful',
a diplomatic report, an encomium by Leo the Deacon, Basil's own epitaph,
the poetry of John Geometres, the miracle collection connected to the Hospital
of Sampson and the L<i>ife of St Symeon the New Theologian</i>.<b><a href="#N_12_">[[12]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There are also important material sources: inscriptions in paint, silk
and stone from across the empire; coins; and most important of all lead
seals recording the careers of Basil's principal civil and military officers.<b><a href="#N_13_">[[13]]</a></b>
While such written and material sources can offer interesting insights
into the reign, they cannot always substitute for lacunae in the historiography.
My own view is that we can learn more about Basil and his empire from the
surviving historiographical record as long as we are explicit about the
problems that the medieval historians present.

<p><b>Early Life</b></p></center>

<p>Basil II was the eldest son o<u>f </u><b><a href="romeii.html">Romanus
II</a></b><u>,</u> grandson of <b><a href="connieviip.html">Constantine
VII Porphyrogenitus</a> </b>and great-grandson of <b><a href="romeil.html">Romanus
I Lecapenus.</a></b> When his father died in 963 Basil and his younger
brother Constantine were still very young. Their mother <b><a href="theophano.html">Theophano</a></b>
briefly ruled on their behalf with the support of the eunuch Joseph Bringas.
This regime was soon replaced, however, by the general <b><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus
(II) Phocas</a></b> and Basil II's own half-uncle, another palace eunuch,
Basil Lecapenus (also known as Basil the <i>Parakoimomenos</i>). Having
married <b><a href="theophano.html">Theophano</a></b> <b><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus</a></b>acted
as guardian and senior emperor to Basil and Constantine. All three emperors
appear on the coinage produced during <b><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus's</a></b>
reign. In 969 <b><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus </a></b>was assassinated
by another general,<b><a href="johntz.html"> John (I) Tzimisces. A</a></b>fter
being prohibited by the Patriarch Polyeuctus from marrying Theophano, <b><a href="johntzi.html">Tzimisces</a></b>
sent the empress into exile while keeping her sons in Constantinople.<b><a href="#N_14_">[[14]]</a></b>
When <b><a href="johntzi.html">Tzimisces</a></b> died in January 976, Basil
aged about twenty, assumed adult rule, with his brother Constantine ruling
as junior emperor.<b><a href="#N_15_">[[15]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b>Civil war 1: The Sclerus Revolt</b></p></center>

<p>During the first thirteen years of his reign Basil faced external adversaries
as well as severe threats from within Byzantium. In the west attacks came
from Bulgaria; in the east from the Fatimids of Egypt, the Buyids of Iraq,
and a variety of Kurdish and Bedouin tribes. However, the principal danger
was domestic: revolts led by the generals Bardas Sclerus and Bardas Phocas.
Plentiful coverage of these revolts by medieval historians means that a
reasonably clear picture of what happened during the civil wars of 976
to 989 can be distilled.<b><a href="#N_16_">[[16]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nonetheless, Skylitzes use of a pro-Sclerus source introduces certain important
distortions in the narrative which need to be identified to make sense
of the early years of Basil's reign.
</p><p>The first period of civil war was precipitated in the spring or early
summer of 976, when Bardas Sclerus, <i>dux </i>of Mesopotamia (the general
in charge of the army based east of the Anti Taurus mountains) rebelled.
From his base at Kharput (Hisn Ziyad) in the Anzitene plain, Sclerus marched
westwards. Once he had captured Melitene, he declared himself emperor.
An imperial embassy led by the metropolitan of Nicomedia was unable to
dissuade Sclerus from this action. The early phases of the war were dominated
by a series of inconclusive skirmishes in the Anti-Taurus between Sclerus's
armies and imperial forces led by Eustathius Maleinus and Michael Burtzes,
the <i>dux</i> of Antioch. Sclerus drew on a wide support base: Armenians
in the army, local eastern Christian populations and dignitaries, and even
neighbouring Arab Muslim princes, such as Abu Taghlib, Hamdanid prince
of Mosul. Yet although it was wide, this alliance was also fragile. Before
he even crossed the Anti-Taurus, Sclerus had to execute his <i>hetaireiarch</i>,
the head of his immediate retinue, on suspicion that he was about to desert
to Basil. Once Sclerus finally mustered the strength to cross the Anti-Taurus
he encountered an imperial army in open combat at Lapara on the eastern
Anatolian plateau. The date of this battle is unknown: either late 976
or early 977. It was a Sclerus victory. Shortly afterwards Michael Burtzes
was captured and his deputy at Antioch surrendered to Sclerus. Sclerus
secured control of an important fleet at Attaleia through the agency of
his admiral Michael Curticius (although the date of this episode is uncertain).<b><a href="#N_17_">[[17]]</a></b>
Another imperial embassy, this time led by Leo the <i>protovestiarius</i>,
was unable to come to terms with Sclerus.
</p><p>For the next two years the rebels held the initiative. Sclerus achieved
another victory over an imperial field army at Rhageas, an unknown location
in Phrygia. The city of Nicaea, guarded by Manuel Eroticus, forbear to
the emperor <b><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius Comnenus</a></b><u>,</u>
fell to the rebels. Abydus was also successfully besieged by Sclerus's
son Romanus, an action which threatened grain supplies to Constantinople.
So difficult was the imperial position that by the spring of 978 Basil
the Parakoimomenos recalled Bardas Phocas, the nephew of the deposed emperor
<b><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus
II Phocas, </a></b>from internal exile. He was appointed <i>domesticus</i>
of the <i>scholai</i>, head of the imperial field army. He headed for Caesarea
in Cappadocia where he raised an army which included those, like Michael
Burtzes, whose precise loyalties during the early years of the revolt had
been uncertain.
</p><p>What happened next is a matter of controversy. According to Scylitzes
at least three battles were fought between Phocas and Sclerus in Anatolia;
the first a victory for Sclerus at Amorium in the west; the second another
Sclerus victory at Basilica Thema in the east; the third a victory for
Phocas on the plain of Pankaleia by the Halys River, achieved only after
imperial forces had been reinforced by several thousand Georgian troops
from the principality of Tao. In contrast Yahya alludes to only two battles:
the first at Pankaleia on June 19, 978, which Sclerus won; the second at
an unknown location on March 24, 979, where Phocas was victorious. As John
Forsyth's work has shown, this confusion can be reconciled by using evidence
from Leo the Deacon, the <i>Life of John and Euthymios</i>, and an inscription
from the Georgian monastery of Zarzma.<b><a href="#N_18_">[[18]]</a></b>
The most plausible resolution is that the first battle was fought at Pankaleia
close to Amorium on the western reaches of the plateau in June of 978;
the second at Basilica Therma in the eastern Anatolian theme of Charsianon
in March 979. The third and final battle reported by Scylitzes, in which
Sclerus and Phocas fought a single-handed duel, did not occur. For Forsyth
this engagement was nothing more than a literary figment on the part of
Scylitzes.
</p><p>Between 976 ad 979 Sclerus presented an important challenge to Basil's
imperial rule. But it is important not to overstate the severity of that
challenge. Scylitzes certainly interprets this three-year period as a relentless
Sclerus initiative against a pusillanimous imperial court. Yet, this depiction
may owe much to his use of a pro-Sclerus source. Other evidence suggests
that Sclerus was rather less dangerous. He was never able to threaten Constantinople
permanently. Whenever he approached the city imperial armies consistently
drove him back onto the Anatolian plateau. His power at sea was only partial.
Important naval victories were won for the emperor by Bardas Parsacutenus
and Theodore Carantenus. At a crucial point in his campaign Sclerus lost
his wealthy eastern Hamdandis allies, when Abu Taghlib, emir of Mosul,
was defeated by the Buyids. In short, although Sclerus was a good general,
he simply did not have the resources to defeat Basil II.
</p><center>
<p><b>Civil War 2: the Phocas Revolt</b></p></center>

<p>The suppression of the Sclerus rebels did not bring stability to Basil's
regime. Sclerus and his immediate retinue took refuge with the Buyid ruler
of Baghdad, Adud al-Dawla. Sclerus's presence in Iraq was the subject of
intense diplomatic exchange between the Byzantine court and the Buyids
during the early 980s. Byzantine ambassadors to Baghdad included Basil's
closest associate at court, Nicephorus Uranus, the keeper of the imperial
inkstand. One of the Buyid envoys who travelled to Constantinople, Ibn
Shahram, left an invaluable account of his own expedition to Constantinople
<i>c</i>.981.<b><a href="#N_19_">[[19]]</a></b>
Shahram indicates that Basil wanted to surrender the empire's client state
of Aleppo in northern Syria in return for Sclerus. This policy attracted
considerable opprobrium from Basil's advisors including his military chiefs
Bardas and Leo Phocas, and his own great-uncle, Basil the <i>Parakoimomenos</i>,
the most important official at court. These tensions within the Byzantine
court reached a crisis in 985. First there were rumours that Basil Lecapenus
was about to incite a palace coup against his great-nephew. Next the armies
of the east suspended their operations against the Fatimids in northern
Syria. But their expectations of a change of regime proved premature. Rather
than removing Basil, the <i>Parakoimomenos </i>found <i>himself</i> dislodged
from power. The emperor then reorganised military high command in the east,
recalling Leo Melissenus, <i>dux</i> of Antioch, and replacing him with
Bardas Phocas, who was transferred from the office of <i>domesticus</i>
of the east. Meanwhile, Basil took control of 'foreign policy' by attacking
Bulgaria in August 986.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>When this initiative collapsed in ignominious defeat, a second period
of civil war ensued. First of all Bardas Sclerus was released from Baghdad
in the winter of 987. He re-entered imperial territory and immediately
revived his rebellion in the area around Melitene. His operation was bankrolled
by Baghdad; his troops were drawn from local Bedouin and Kurdish tribesmen.
By spring 987 Phocas was hastily reassigned to his erstwhile position of
<i>domesticus</i>
to deal with the Sclerus threat. However, his loyalty to the emperor soon
evaporated. By August or September at the very latest Phocas had declared
himself emperor. He probably spent the summer negotiating a military alliance
with Sclerus which included as one of its terms the eventual division of
the empire between the two generals. The exact timing and nature of the
Phocas/Sclerus agreement are obscure, but it is likely Sclerus was promised
little more than the empire's eastern frontier region rather than the whole
of Asia Minor as is sometimes argued. One of the reasons why working out
what happened during the Phocas/Sclerus negotiations and their subsequent
joint revolt is so difficult is because once again Scylitzes's testimony
exaggerates Sclerus's strengths. Scylitzes claims that Sclerus was so clever
that he allied himself with Phocas, while at the same time dispatching
his son Romanus to work for Basil II just in case the emperor was victorious.
Yahya in contrast maintains that Romanus distrusted Phocas and went over
to the emperor of his own accord. Yahya's account is more plausible. Shortly
after the two generals agreed terms Phocas imprisoned Sclerus. The truth
was that Sclerus was in a much weaker position than Scylitzes indicates.
He had been forced into alliance with Phocas because his Bedouin and Kurdish
troops had deserted him.
</p><p>In contrast, while Scylitzes provides relatively little information
about the Phocas rebels, they were clearly more dangerous opponents than
the Sclerii for Basil. Once rebellion broke out in the summer of 987 they
consistently threatened Constantinople from the Asian side of the Bosphorus.
It was impossible for Basil to drive Phocas back from the coast as had
been the case with Sclerus a decade previously. Phocas commanded the loyalty
of all the eastern armies and most senior commanders. Only the smaller
western armies and a handful of generals stayed loyal to the emperor. Romanus
Sclerus helped Basil to defend crucial sites such as Abydus. Gregory Taronites
(another erstwhile Sclerus supporter) tried unsuccessfully to rally local
leaders along the eastern frontier only to find himself defeated by troops
from Tao loyal to the Phocades. The peril which Basil faced demanded a
desperate solution. He sent his sister Anna as a bride to Vladimir, prince
of Kiev, in return for around six thousand Rus mercenary troops. This was
a spectacular, and ultimately successful, gamble. In late 988 or early
989, Rus troops helped Basil to destroy a rebel army led by Calocyrus Delphinas
at Chrysopolis. On April 13th 989 the emperor took the field against Phocas
in battle at Abydus carrying the Blachernae icon of the Virgin. Basil's
brother Constantine was also present, later claiming that his was the spear
which slew the rebel. Yet, as both Scylitzes and Psellus acknowledge, the
exact fate of Phocas was unknown. Some contemporaries believed he fell
in battle; others that he was poisoned. What is clear is that Basil decided
to make brutal examples of the rebels. Delphinas had been impaled after
his defeat. After Abydus Phocas's head was sent on a grisly tour of the
empire. The terrifying warning was successful. By November 989 Leo Phocas
ceded Antioch. Meanwhile at an unknown date, but certainly before his death
on March 6, 991, Bardas Sclerus surrendered to the emperor. The civil wars
were over.
</p><center>
<p><b>After 989: legislation and propaganda</b></p></center>

<p>While it is relatively straightforward to construct a narrative account
of the civil wars of 976 to 989, it is much more difficult to understand
what was at stake politically. Often it is argued that these revolts were
the culmination in a long tenth-century conflict between the Macedonian
emperors and Byzantium's great aristocratic families over the material
resources of the empire. In fomenting revolt the Sclerus and Phocas families
displayed the potency of the greater families; in brutally defeating the
rebels and later crushing their families Basil re-established imperial
power.<b><a href="#N_20_">[[20]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Two pieces of evidence
appear to support this view. The first is a long series of novels issued
by the Macedonians during the tenth century which tried to prevent the
so-called 'powerful' (<i>dunati</i>) from accumulating estates at the expense
of the 'poor' and the imperial fisc. The last, and most draconian, novel
in the corpus was issued in 996 by Basil II. This required that all properties
acquired by the 'powerful' within free peasant <i>choria</i> (village)
since 927 should be restored to their former owners without compensation.
It abolished the prevailing practice that such properties were immune from
investigation after the passage of forty years. It also identified the
Phocades as typical of the worst kind of 'powerful' offenders. The second
strand in the evidence is Michael Psellus's pen portrait of the emperor
which appears to suggest that after defeating Sclerus and Phocas Basil
crushed the greater families of the empire and took sole control of imperial
governance.<b><a href="#N_21_">[[21]]</a></b>
</p><p>However, there are reasons for doubting that the civil wars were about
a struggle between emperor and landed aristocracy. In the first place it
is unlikely that the balance of material resources was slipping in the
tenth century inexorably away from the emperors towards the aristocracy.
Contemporaries within and outside the empire consistently point to the
Byzantine emperors' substantial income. This had been significantly augmented
by the eastern conquests of Basil's imperial predecessors.<b><a href="#N_22_">[[22]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
In addition events during the civil wars indicated that revolt was not
sustained by private wealth and manpower but instead by the tenure of public
office, especially command over imperial armies. Whenever Sclerus and Phocas
held high military office they were dangerous: as generals they were able
to negotiate alliances with neighbouring states, hold imperial fortresses,
and sequester taxes. Without public office they lost these resources and
their revolts immediately fizzled out. This is exactly what happened when
Sclerus returned from exile in 987. Another reason for thinking that the
revolts were not primarily about an irreconcilable hatred between the greater
families and the emperor, is the fact that after the insurrection was over
many rebels were treated generously. The Sclerus family had their lands
returned and were restored to public office. Bardas Sclerus even received
the title of <i>curopalates</i>. Meanwhile Bardas Phocas's son Nicephorus
was given a new estate. While the Phocas family were probably deprived
of public office for the rest of Basil's reign, several of their allies,
including Leo Melissenus, were restored to command. As research into the
prosopography of Basil's reign indicates, the emperor continued throughout
his reign to employ great families within his armies, particularly during
his conflict with the Bulgarians.<b><a href="#N_23_">[[23]]</a></b>
</p><p>Rather than turning on implacable opposition between emperor and aristocracy,
the conflicts which characterised the early years of Basil's reign were
more about foreign policy and control of the army. That the army was a
critical structural element within the Byzantine state was a principle
long recognised by contemporaries, including Basil's grandfather <b><a href="connieviip.html">Constantine
VII</a></b> in the mid tenth century: <i>t</i>he army is to the state as
the head is to the body; if it changes the whole must change with it, and
whoever does not carefully supervise it, endangers his own safety.<b><a href="#N_24_">[[24]]</a></b>
The coups of <b><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus Phocas</a></b> and<b><a href="johntzi.zip">
John Tzimisces</a></b> had set the precedent for experienced generals to
seize imperial power. When Basil came to the throne in 976 he was very
young. Those with greater experience clearly wished to dominate his decisions,
particularly about military affairs, and if necessary replace him. Conflict
was the result. When he visited Constantinople in 981 Ibn Shahram reported
that Basil himself believed that his argument with Bardas Phocas about
imperial policy towards Aleppo could lead to his deposition. Scylitzes
alleges that one of the reasons for the Phocas rebellion in 987 was that
many leading generals had been denied a role in the Bulgarian expedition
of 986.<b><a href="#N_25_">[[25]]</a></b>
</p><p>But if control over the army and foreign policy rather than competition
for private resources lay at the heart of political tensions during the
early years of Basil's reign, it is clear that the emperor's defeat of
Sclerus and Phocas in 989 did little to alleviate the difficulty. For while
power remained vested in the army, whoever commanded the army would continue
to threaten the emperor. And indeed, for several years after 989, military
commanders, particularly those in the east, worried Basil persistently.
The foremost example was Michael Burtzes, an experienced soldier whose
loyalty to the emperor during the first Sclerus revolt had wavered (see
above). His relationship with Basil remained tense during the 990s when
he was <i>dux </i>of Antioch. The two argued about levels of troops and
the treatment of Muslim envoys. Burtzes was eventually dismissed in 995.
I would suggest that it was only after 1000-01, when Basil was able to
reach a peace settlement with the Fatimids, that the problem caused by
the eastern generals could be resolved (see below).
</p><p>Yet, if the Phocas and Sclerus revolts were primarily conflicts about
control of the army, how should we interpret Michael Psellus's allegations
and the provisions of the 996 novel? My reading is that neither text is
primarily about conflict between Basil and the great families. In the novel
the emperor's hostility towards the 'powerful' families is of secondary
significance: the Phocades, for instance, are named only in a later scholium
rather than in the main body of the text. Instead the novel's main purpose
seems to have been to impose Basil's authority over a court and administration
which had for so long been dominated by the influence and reputation of
his great-uncle, Basil the <i>Parakoimomeno</i>s. This Basil had been an
experienced general, diplomat and administrator, located at the very centre
of politics throughout the third quarter of the tenth century. He remained
powerful in the early years of Basil II's reign, but increasingly his authority
was rejected by the emperor. Ibn Shahram reported that by 981 the two were
estranged over Aleppo. Basil II finally dismissed his great-uncle from
office in 985. The <i>Parakoimomenos</i> died shortly afterwards. Yet the
struggle between the two Basils for control over the central levers of
power continued long after this date. This much can be ascertained from
the novel of 996, which indicates that more than ten years after the <i>Parakoimomenos's</i>
death Basil II was still trying to annul the grants and privileges issued
by his great-uncle, still trying to unpick a complex web of political affiliations,
still trying to browbeat his own officials into recognising his omniscient
and omnipotent position at the heart of Byzantine government.<b><a href="#N_26_">[[26]]</a></b>
</p><p>Interpreted in this way, the novel of 996 becomes part of the changes
that occurred when one member of the Macedonian-Lecapenus imperial family
replaced another as the fulcrum of imperial government. That Basil wished
to place himself explicitly at the centre of the state in the minds of
his subjects and officials may also explain some of the material artefacts
of his reign. Imperial omnipotence is graphically represented in the frontispiece
to Basil II's Psalter. Here Basil appears in military dress, in the guise
of an emperor of Late Antiquity, crowned by Christ, supported by his friends
the military saints, and receiving the submission of a multitude of peoples.
Recent research suggests that these peoples were as likely to be Basil's
own subjects as his overseas adversaries. Another index of Basil's all-seeing,
all-knowing self-image is the epitaph to his tomb. The emperor describes
his constant vigilance: <i>for none saw my spear lie still from the time
the emperor of heaven called me great emperor autocrator of the earth ..
now campaigning manfully to the west . now to the very borders of the east</i>.
This rhetoric was absorbed by contemporary historians. The obituary for
Basil recorded by Yahya ibn Sa'id may have been taken from an official
eulogy issued at the time of the emperor's death. Yahya describes Basil
as an emperor who: throughout his reign looked into every matter, great
or small, in his empire.<b><a href="#N_27_">[[27]]</a></b>
</p><p>A rather similar picture surfaces in Michael Psellus's austere portrait
of Basil. He describes Basil's omniscience and conscientious scrutiny of
every aspect of government; he reports Basil's constant watchfulness over
the empire's frontiers; he stresses the emperor's fondness for modest attire
and his disdain for luxury; he emphasises Basil's successful expansion
of the imperial treasury, a characteristic also picked up by Yahya. More
to the point he describes, in very similar terms to the novel of 996, the
emperor's attempt to censor his great-uncle's legislation. In many senses
Psellus's account of Basil's reign is a diptych of the two Basils: Emperor
and <i>Parakoimomenos</i>.<sup> </sup>In his account Psellus even reorders
events so that the demise of the <i>Parakoimomenos </i>forms the centre-point
of his narrative. This structural change means that Psellus makes the demise
of the <i>Parakoimomenos</i> the catalyst which changes Basil II from a
dilettante into an autocrat. This textual reordering also suggests that
for Psellus the conflict between the two Basils was more important than
the emperor's conflict with the powerful families. In Psellus's account
Sclerus and Phocas become two of many problems that Basil faced rather
than the central problem. Psellus's focus on the <i>Parakoimomenos </i>has
been interpreted in a variety of ways. Perhaps Psellus saw in the story
of the rise and fall of the Parakoimomenos something of his own thwarted
career in imperial service? Perhaps as a neo-pagan hostile towards established
religion, Psellus dwells on the <i>Parakoimomenos</i> because he wants
to savour the moment when the emperor destroyed the most potent symbol
of his great-uncle's power, his monastery?<b><a href="#N_28_">[[28]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Matters may, however, be more straightforward. I would argue that Psellus
makes the conflict between the two Basils the central event of the reign
because this was how contemporaries during the reign itself saw the matter.
In stressing the extent to which the rise of Basil the emperor sprang from
the fall of Basil the <i>Parakoimomenos,</i> Psellus merely echoes the
novel of 996.<b><a href="#N_29_">[[29]]</a></b>
</p><p>Basil II faced considerable domestic problems in the first half of his
reign: civil wars fomented by his generals; a long struggle for control
over the central government with his great-uncle. Psellus seems to suggest
that the fundamental question of Basil's reign was: who was to guide the
ship of state? The erosion of the imperial fisc and the growth of private
estates were at most secondary issues. From as early as Ibn Shahram's embassy
to Constantinople in 981, it is clear that Basil wanted to be in charge.
His struggle to achieve this goal would take him many years. However, after
1000, as we shall see below, reality began to align with the emperor's
rhetoric.
</p><center>
<p><b>The East</b></p></center>

<p>The area where imperial policy changed most dramatically as a result
of Basil's determination to captain the ship of state was Byzantium's eastern
frontier. For much of the century before Basil came to power this area
had been the focus of Byzantine military aggression. Following the collapse
of the Abbasid caliphate, Byzantine armies had forced their way over the
Taurus and Anti-Taurus mountains into Cilicia, northern Syria, and northern
Mesopotamia, territorially redefining a Byzantine east that had previously
been limited to the Anatolian plateau. When Basil came to the throne Byzantium's
new eastern territories were areas where administrative structures still
remained very fluid and imperial authority had yet to be fully imposed.
</p><p>At the time of his accession the empire's most threatening eastern neighbours
were the Fatimids, a militant Shia dynasty from north Africa, who had conquered
Egypt and much of Syria in 969-70. During the first half of Basil's reign,
competition between the two powers focused on two strategic targets: the
coastal ports of northern Syria and Lebanon, and Aleppo, the Hamdanid emirate
in northern Syria, a Byzantine client state since 969/70. Various generals
were involved in conflict with the Fatimids between 976-988, including
Michael Burtzes (see above), Leo Melissenus, and Bardas Phocas. A brief
period of peace occurred in 988 when the Fatimids agreed to a Byzantine
embassy which asked for a truce so that Basil's energies could be devoted
to fighting the Phocas revolt. Conflict however broke out again, and with
greater seriousness, during the 990s, as Fatimid armies repeatedly besieged
Aleppo. Byzantine armies based at Antioch under the leadership of Michael
Burtzes were defeated in open battle in 992 and 994. The second of these
reverses was so serious that Basil II marched from his wars in Bulgaria
with a detachment of the Byzantine field army, crossed Anatolia in a little
over two weeks, and arrived unexpectedly in northern Syria in the early
spring of 995. The Fatimid army fled and Michael Burtzes was sacked as
<i>dux</i>.
This was not the last occasion that Basil was forced to intervene personally
in eastern warfare. In 998 Byzantine forces based at Antioch under the
command of Damian Dalassenus suffered another defeat. Basil responded by
ravaging Fatimid-held territory in the Orontes valley before cutting westwards
to the coast to invest Tripoli. Although the siege was unsuccessful, Basil's
swift military response to the defeat of Dalassenus persuaded the advisors
surrounding the young Fatimid caliph, al-Hakim, to come to terms. The result
was a peace which lasted without serious rupture from 1001 to 1016. It
was unshaken even by al-Hakim's destruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre
in Jerusalem in 1009.<b><a href="#N_30_">[[30]]</a></b>
</p><p>For at least the first seven years of this period of peace Basil's close
associate Nicephorus Uranus served as the emperor's second-in-command on
the eastern frontier. Known as 'krator of the east', according to his seals
at least, Nicephorus appears to have exercised plenipotentiary powers over
the whole eastern frontier, in command of both civil and military administration.
Not much can be ascertained of his career in the east, although his military
manual and letters give us some clues about Byzantine tactics in eastern
warfare at the end of the tenth century. Only occasional glimpses of Nicephorus's
military activities and his fearsome reputation are visible in the eastern
historical narratives and the letters of his friend the judge of Tarsus,
Philetus Synadenus.<b><a href="#N_31_">[[31]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet,
perhaps the sources' silence, especially that of Yahya, during this period
is significant. We learn little of Nicephorus and the eastern frontier
simply because very little happened. The most Nicephorus had to do was
deal with local revolts like that of the dervish insurrectionary al-Asfar
in the Diyar Mudar in 1006-7.<b><a href="#N_32_">[[32]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Peace with the Fatimids in 1001 allowed Basil to concentrate the empire's
military energies in the west, safe in the knowledge that his frontier
army in the east was under the tutelage of his most loyal associate. And
although this situation deteriorated to some extent when Fatimid forces
occupied Aleppo in 1016, Byzantino-Fatimid rivalry remained highly localised.
There was no return to the full-scale hostilities that characterised the
pre-1000 period.
</p><p>Further east the Djazira frontier, which stretched along the Upper Euphrates
and Upper Tigris rivers, was still an area of active hostility between
Byzantium and local Muslim powers in 976. When Basil came to the throne
Bardas Sclerus was immediately appointed to military command in this area
as <i>dux</i> of Mesopotamia. According to Scylitzes, Sclerus regarded
this appointment as a backwater posting. Yet, events preceding Sclerus's
appointment suggest that Scylitzes was mistaken in this impression. Far
from being a backwater this was a 'hot frontier' where Byzantine armies
during the reign of <b><a href="johntzi.html">John Tzimisces</a></b> had
been particularly active. Imperial forces had attacked Edessa and Nisibis
in 972 and Amida in 973.<b><a href="#N_33_">[[33]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
One can speculate that the imperial authorities in Constantinople on the
death of Tzimisces, perhaps in an effort to save money, wanted to scale
back the offensive. But a reining in of the offensive rather than the remoteness
of his command is more likely to have been the real nub of Sclerus's complaints
and the catalyst to his revolt (see above).<b><a href="#N_34_">[[34]]</a></b>
</p><p>While the exact cause of Sclerus's revolt is obscure, its impact on
this sector of the frontier was immediate. The Byzantine offensive stopped.
And when the Buyid emir, Adud ad Daula, expelled Abu Taghlib, Sclerus's
regional ally, from Mosul, Mayafariqin and Amida in 978-9, the empire found
itself faced by a potent foe.<b><a href="#N_35_">[[35]] </a></b>For&nbsp;
the next five years, until he died in 983, Adud unified a vast landmass
around his base in Baghdad; an empire which stretched from Persia in the
east to the Diyar Bakr in the west. Adud soon showed himself willing to
intervene in Byzantium's civil wars in the hope of territorial gain. Having
given the Sclerus party 'sanctuary' in a Baghdad prison in 979, Adud's
negotiations with Basil turned on the premise that he would return Sclerus
in echange for either a series of mountain fortresses in the Diyar Bakr
or control of Aleppo. Although the potency of the Buyid threat waned with
Adud's death, Buyid Baghdad continued to sponsor Sclerus when he returned
to the empire in 987.<b><a href="#N_36_">[[36]]</a></b>
</p><p>By the time Sclerus returned to the empire Arab bedouin and Kurdish
nomad tribes were beginning to replace the Buyids as regional authorities
in the Djazira. The last Buyid governor left Mosul in 996 and was replaced
by the Uqalids. Meanwhile the Kurdish emirate founded by Bad ibn Dustuk
absorbed the Diyar Bakr, as well as a variety of urban sites on the northern
shores of Lake Van in Armenia. During the Phocas revolt, Bad took advantage
of the mayhem inside Byzantium to raid the plain of Muº in Taron,
an Armenian princedom annexed by Byzantium in 966/7. It was only in 992/3,
after Bad's death and a series of Byzantine punitive raids around Lake
Van, that Basil was able to negotiate a lasting peace with the Kurdish
emirate. In 1000 this deal was further solidified when Basil II offered
Bad's nephew, ibn Marwan, the title of <i>magistros, </i>the office of
<i>dux</i>
of the east, and the promise that imperial troops would assist the Marwanids
if they came under outside attack<i>.</i><b><a href="#N_37_">[[37]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
This was one of many instances in the second half of his reign when&nbsp;
Basil proved willing to use a local potentate to control frontier territories.
Deals of this sort enabled the emperor to cut down the size of the Byzantine
army garrisoned along the frontier and thereby reduce the political threat
of eastern army commanders to emperors in Constantinople.
</p><p>In western Caucasia Byzantium's neighbours were predominantly Christian
princes, who rarely threatened the empire directly, but whose political
confidence and economic prosperity were both growing in the later tenth
century. Their prosperity was based on their ability to tax the international
trade routes that ran north-south and east-west through their domains.
They then invested these revenues in extensive building programmes: constructing
churches, monasteries and even cities. Their confidence sprang from military
success, particularly against the Muslim emirates of Lake Van and Azerbaijan.
Foremost of these princes was David of Tao, whose regional prominence grew
particularly strong during the Sclerus and Phocas revolts, having supported
the revolt of Bardas Phocas (see above). In 978/9 he supplied Basil II
with reinforcements in the struggle against Sclerus. His reward was the
lifetime stewardship of key imperial territories, including the city of
Theodosiopolis and the plain of Basean. His good fortune changed at the
end of the 980s. Having supported Phocas, he was forced in the aftermath
of the rebels' defeat to make the emperor Basil II the legatee of his princedom
of Tao. This agreement destroyed a previous arrangement by which David
had made his adopted son Bagrat III of Abasgia his heir.<b><a href="#N_38_">[[38]]</a></b>
</p><p>When David died early in 1000, Basil II happened to be in the east of
the empire, wintering on the plain of Tarsus following his raids against
the Fatimids in northern Syria. On hearing of David's death he marched
north-eastwards to collect his inheritance. Having dispersed token resistance
to the Byzantine take-over from the local Georgian nobility, the emperor
garrisoned the key fortresses of Tao. He also accepted obeisance from a
variety of neighbouring Caucasian princes, Muslim as well as Christian,
who were rewarded with imperial titles. The following year, one of these
princes, Gurgen of Iberia (K'art'li), unhappy that he had only received
the title of <i>magistros</i>, invaded Tao. His attempts were thwarted
by a Byzantine army led by Nicephorus Uranus, the new <i>dux</i> of Antioch
(see above). Yet, despite this Byzantine victory, little further effort
was made to impose imperial authority. Instead while Basil was busy fighting
the Bulgarians in the west, a powerful Georgian state began to emerge.
In 1008 Bagrat III ruler of Abasgia, and erstwhile adopted son of David
of Tao, inherited Iberia (K'art'li) from his natural father Gurgen, thus
uniting a region extending from the eastern shore of the Black Sea, to
the foothills of the Caucasus mountains. Bagrat also conquered the princedom
of Kakhetia, north east of Tiflis, and acquired the city of Ardanoutzin,
a trading station north of Tao which enjoyed an immense customs revenue
that was coveted by successive tenth-century Byzantine emperors including
Basil II<i>.</i> When he died in 1014 Bagrat left his son George a considerable
legacy, including a longstanding claim to those territories in Tao which
were in Byzantine hands.
</p><p>It was in the context of Tao that relations with Christian Caucasia
became more important during the final decade of Basil's reign. With the
accession of George in 1014, a disagreement immediately broke out about
David's patrimony. Having warned George to stay out of David's former princedom,
Basil sent an imperial army to crush Iberian resistance in 1014. This army
was decisively defeated. However, once the annexation of Bulgaria was completed
in 1018 (see below), preparations for a larger-scale campaign were set
in train, beginning with the refortification of Theodosiopolis. Three years
later Basil marched east. Although his first incursion into Iberia in the
autumn of 1021 proved to be inconclusive, another offensive in the spring
of 1022 resulted in a crushing victory. In return for peace, George handed
over several fortresses and his son Bagrat as a hostage. Meanwhile, Basil's
interest in Caucasia did not stop with Georgia but extended into Armenia.
In the winter of 1021/2 John Smbat, prince of the Armenian kingdom of Ani,
made Basil his heir. His territories eventually passed to the Byzantines
in 1042, long after Basil had died. At around the same time Senecherim,
the Artsruni prince of Vaspurakan, took a rather similar decision. He surrendered
his hereditary lands south of Lake Van to Byzantium in return for a miscellany
of titles, offices, and estates within the empire<span size="-1">.</span>The
date of this agreement is, however, obscure. Was it 1016 (Scylitzes), 1019
(Aristakes), or 1021-2 (Yahya)?<b><a href="#N_39_">[[39]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Equally unclear is the strategic context. Although later Armenian historians,
such as Matthew of Edessa, assert that the decision was precipitated by
Turcoman raids, it is likely that pressure on the Artsruni came from elsewhere:
either the Marwanids (see above), the Shaddadids of Dvin, or the Rawwadids
of Azerbaijan<b><a href="#N_40_">([[40]]</a></b> That the Rawwadids may
have been the principal danger is suggested by the action Basil took after
he defeated George of Abasgia in 1022. When he left Tao, he marched to
Vaspurakan, and then headed east to the plain of Her, west of Lake Urmia.
Although the emperor was forced to turn westwards when the early autumn
snows fell, Basil's target seems to have been the emirate of Azerbaijan
located to the east of Lake Urmia.
</p><p>Basil II's final expedition to the east lasted for nearly three years.
Yet, this interest in the east at the very end of the emperor's life was
relatively unusual in the context of the reign as a whole. Before the annexation
of Bulgaria in 1018 Basil preferred peaceful relations with his neighbours
in the east, both Christian and Muslim. In this outlook Basil departed
radically from his imperial predecessors, <b><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus
Phocas </a></b>and <b><a href="johntzi.html">John Tzimisces</a></b>. Basil
rarely campaigned in the east. Even in 995 and 999-1000 his interest was
focused on using force to compel his neighbours to accept treaties and
alliances. After 1000 local potentates supervised by the <i>dux</i> of
Antioch were used to police the frontier. The number and size of Byzantine
garrisons were reduced. Many forts were abandoned or even deliberately
destroyed. Eastern territories within the Byzantine empire were governed
and taxed through indigenous Christian and Muslim officials who reported
to a small number of centrally-appointed Constantinople administrators.
Policies inaugurated by <b><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus Phocas</a></b>
which encouraged eastern Orthodox communities, such as Monophysite Armenians
and Syrians, to settle in Byzantine eastern territories were continued.
Even Muslims were allowed to remain in the empire if they paid a head tax.<b><a href="#N_41_">[[41]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b>Bulgaria</b></p></center>

<p>It is relatively easy to track Basil's policies and achievements in
the east because so many historical texts report on this region. In contrast
Basil's relations with Bulgaria are much harder to trace in the medieval
historical record. Only John Scylitzes provides any detailed treatment
of the region. Some of his coverage is typified by colourful narrative.
More usual, however, are short chapters full of isolated references to
raids and sieges. Such chapters are devoid of strategic context and expressed
through bland military vocabulary. Information is brutally edited and often
telescoped. Dates and topographical data are casualties. Chronology is
often sacrificed to theme. It is particularly difficult to know what to
make of the large geographical and chronological confusions and lacunae
in the text. Do they mean that Basil was only sporadically at war with
the Bulgars here? Or do they mean that Basil II was constantly at war with
Bulgaria but that this reality is obscured by Scylitzes's methods of composition
and his particular historical interests?
</p><p>Working out why and when Basil and Bulgaria came to blows at all is
a considerable problem. Not much is known about Byzantino-Bulgarian relations
after 971 when<b><a href="johntzi.html"> John Tzimisces</a></b> had won
important victories over a joint Russo-Bulgarian army in eastern Bulgaria.
At this point the Rus were expelled from Bulgaria and the Bulgarian tsar
Boris was captured and paraded with his imperial regalia in Constantinople.
But, from this point on the picture of Bulgaria becomes obscure, illuminated
only by coins, seals, inscriptions, archaeology and occasional textual
references (principally a list of imperial officials known as the 'Escorial
Tacticon'). From such evidence it appears that Preslav (renamed Theodoropolis
by <b><a href="johntzi.html">Tzimisces</a></b>) in eastern Bulgaria became
the centre of a Byzantine province. Roman forts on the Danube were rebuilt
to defend Bulgaria from further Rus attack. Yet, establishing how these
new administrative and military structures developed is problematic because
so little of the surviving evidence can be dated with pinpoint accuracy.
Sigillographical and textual evidence can be used to reconstruct the careers
of several individuals who held offices in the Balkans in the later tenth
and early eleventh centuries. But it is more difficult to build a convincing
narrative of Byzantine rule simply by synthesising these careers with Scylitzes's
confused chronology. As far as the late tenth century is concerned, the
available evidence cannot really indicate how far Byzantine administration
penetrated into Bulgaria during the 970s, and how long it survived the
death of Tzimisces in 976.<b><a href="#N_42_">[[42]]</a></b>
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>The main problem with working out what happened to Byzantine rule in
Bulgaria after 971 stems from Scylitzes's method of composition. Rather
than offering a chronological account, Scylitzes summarises events between
971 and Basil's first invasion of Bulgaria in 986 in two separate summary
chapters. The first chapter is chronologically displaced occurring, rather
disconcertingly, in his narrative about <b><a href="nikkiep.html">Nicephorus
Phocas's </a></b>rise to power in 963. The second chapter forms a preface
to his longer narrative treatment of Basil II's 986 invasion.<b><a href="#N_43_">[[43]]</a></b>
Both passages lack detail. In the first Scylitzes refers to Peter, emperor
of the Bulgars, who sent his two sons to the Byzantines as hostages. He
goes on to mention the death of that emperor (Peter) and how the two sons
were subsequently dispatched by the Byzantines to fight the rebels David,
Aaron, Samuel and Moses Cometopuli, sons of the most powerful <i>comes</i>
in Bulgaria. The second passage states that the Cometopuli rebelled only
when<b><a href="johntzi.html"> John Tzimisces </a></b>died. At this time
Peter's sons, Boris and Romanus, escaped to Bulgaria from Constantinople.
Boris died en route shot by a 'friendly fire' arrow. Romanus stayed in
Bulgaria before returning to Constantinople at an unstated time in the
future. Meanwhile, all the Cometopuli died except for Samuel. Moses and
David perished in battle; Aaron was killed by Samuel for favouring the
Byzantines. Finally, Samuel overran Thrace, Macedonia, the suburbs of Thessalonica,
Thessaly, Hellas and the Peloponnese. He besieged and took many places,
including Larissa, the main city in the fertile plain of Thessaly.
</p><p>Some of confusions in these summary accounts can be unravelled using
other evidence. Alternative narrative material in Scylitzes's own account
of <b><a href="johntzi.html">Tzimisces'</a></b>s reign and in Leo the Deacon's
history demonstrates that Peter's son Boris was not held hostage continuously
in Constantinople between 963 and the 970s. Instead he was emperor of the
Bulgars between 969 and 971. Unfortunately, however, very few reconstructions
of this type are possible because other sources of evidence are either
non-existent or extremely difficult to date. My own reading of the evidence
is that if Scylitzes' testimony is analysed in the context of his own working
methods, then it soon becomes clear that assembling a reliable chronology
to the outbreak of Bulgaor-Byzantine hostility (and indeed to the rest
of the conflict) is all but impossible. In these first two summary passages,
Scylitzes is not even trying to provide an accurately dated appraisal of
the rise of Bulgarian power. Instead, he is sketching a general background
to form a backdrop for his account of Basil's expedition in 986. It is
not at all clear that the limited information in these summary chapters
necessarily preceded August 986; some events may have happened later. Support
for this idea comes from an interpolation made into Scylitzes's text by
Michael of Devol, an early twelfth-century Macedonian bishop who took an
interest in Basil's conflict with the Bulgarians. According to Michael,
Aaron Cometopulus was still alive when Basil invaded in 986. Indeed he
was part of the Bulgarian army that fought with the emperor in the Haemus
passes.<b><a href="#N_44_">[[44]]</a></b> In these circumstances the most
we can say about the period before 986 is that there was a serious revival
in Bulgarian political power, although it is impossible to know how extensive
this was and how far the Byzantine gains of 971 were eroded. It is likely,
although difficult to prove, that the Cometopuli were able to consolidate
their power in western Macedonia while the empire's resources were focused
on fighting Sclerus, the Fatimids and Buyids.
</p><p>Whatever the state of Bulgar and Byzantine relations before 986, Basil's
invasion in August paradoxically tipped the balance towards Bulgaria. This
invasion is a rare occasion in the course of Basil's relations with the
Balkans where other narrative sources can be used to refine the picture
presented by Scylitzes. According to Scylitzes, Basil's army invaded Bulgaria
with the intention of besieging the city of Sardica (modern day Sofia).
At first Samuel and his Bulgarian forces looked on from their mountain
fastnesses, afraid to meet the emperor in open battle. But once the siege
was underway, distrust spread among the senior officers of the Byzantine
army. Stephen (or Contostephanus), who held the office <i>domestikus of
the west</i>, accused his rival Leo Melissenus of plotting against the
emperor. Basil and his army withdrew in panic, only to be attacked by Samuel
as they retreated. When rumours of a conspiracy proved to be false, Basil
reacted angrily, and according to Scylitzes threw Contostephanus by his
beard to the ground<b><a href="#N_45_">([[45]]</a></b> Yet, comparison
with the other accounts of Basil's defeat in 986 suggest that Scylitzes
prizes the entertaining anecdote over more fundamental reasons for the
expedition's failure. Leo the Deacon was an eye-witness on the 986 expedition.
He does not even mention the conspiracy story, but instead consistently
indicates that the campaign failed because the Byzantines were incompetent,
complacent, and lacked supplies. The Byzantines were not simply routed
as they returned home, but subjected to constant raids throughout the campaign.<b><a href="#N_46_">[[46]]</a></b>
This logistical interpretation is supported by Stephen of Taron and by
a contemporary military manual. This military handbook, devoted to Byzantine
warfare in the Balkans, dwells on how military success can be achieved
in a Balkan context. It stresses the need for a strong camp, regular supplies,
and adequate defence in the passes. So close are the parallels between
these recommendations and Leo's diagnosis of defeat, that it has been suggested
that this manual was composed in response to the disaster of 986, and that
it was used as a handbook for Basil's subsequent campaigns in Bulgaria.<b><a href="#N_47_">[[47]]</a></b>
</p><p>Basil's defeat in Bulgaria precipitated new rebellions by Sclerus and
Phocas (see above). Trapped in Constantinople Basil was unable to contemplate
action in the Balkans between 987 and 989. Instead, it is likely that the
Bulgarians continued to gain the upper hand. Documentary evidence from
Mount Athos refers to Bulgarian raiding against the town of Hierissos near
Thessalonica. The sombre poetry of the former soldier John Geometres refers
to a constant Bulgarian menace in this period.<b><a href="#N_48_">[[48]]</a></b>&nbsp;
It was only once the civil wars were over that the emperor could turn once
again to Bulgaria.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>Various eastern sources allude to a renewed Byzantine offensive in the
Balkans led by Basil early in the 990s. Yahya and Stephen of Taron both
mention an invasion in 991.<b><a href="#N_49_">[[49]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
At least one, and possibly two, embassies from Aleppo met the emperor when
he was on active campaign in the Balkans.<b><a href="#N_50_">[[50]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
It was only the Fatimid victory over Michael Burtzes in 994 that forced
Basil to turn his attentions away from Bulgaria to the eastern frontier.<b><a href="#N_51_">[[51]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
In addition to military campaigns the emperor also clearly attempted to
counter the Bulgars through diplomatic alliances. Documentary evidence
from Athos refers to a Serbian embassy (possibly sent by the Prince of
Diocleia) in 993.<b><a href="#N_52_">[[52]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile,
it is possible that the Byzantino-Venetian alliance of 992 (see below and
above) was struck in a Bulgar-related context. Curiously, however, Scylitzes
pays little attention to this picture of active military and diplomatic
campaigning on the part of Basil, but concentrates instead on the activities
of the emperor's commanders. He includes a lot of material, for example,
on Gregory Taronites <i>dux </i>of Thessalonica: he expounds on Gregory's
heroic death in an ambush, the capture of his son Ashot, and the subsequent
marriage of that son into the Bulgarian royal family. All these aspects
to this story reflect Scylitzes's characteristic interest in aristocratic
pedigrees, particularly of those families like the Taronites who were politically
important at the time when Scylitzes was writing. That such interests can
mislead, however, is made clear by Stephen of Taron's testimony. Like Scylitzes
Stephen mentions the Taronites, yet unlike Scylitzes he sets their achievements
in the context of active campaigning by Basil II.<b><a href="#N_53_">[[53]]</a></b>
</p><p>The extremely fragmentary nature of the historical record makes it difficult
to assess the successes and failures of Basil's initiative. Yet it is likely
that for much of the 990s the emperor's position remained parlous. Several
Byzantine senior military officials were eliminated by Bulgarian attack:
in addition to Ashot Taronites, John Chaldus, another
<i>dux</i> of Thessalonica,
was also taken captive, probably after 99<span size="-1">5.</span><b><a href="#N_54_">[[54]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Scylitzes claims that several local commanders and prominent townsmen in
Byzantine-held territory conspired with Samuel. These officials included
two <i>strategi</i> from Adrianople, and a certain Malacenus, who can probably
be identified with the <i>strategus </i>of Hellas whose disgrace is mentioned
in an undated passage in the life of St Nikon of Sparta.<b><a href="#N_55_">[[55]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Scylitzes makes these allegations in a summary chapter dedicated to the
theme of defection which may include materials from a wide time period.
However, evidence from Athos suggests that at least one individual Scylitzes
accuses of collusion, Paul Bobos, an archon in Thessalonica, was found
guilty before 996.<b><a href="#N_56_">[[56]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, the
strongest evidence for Byzantine weakness during the 990s comes, paradoxically,
from the crushing victory that Basil's close associate Nicephorus Uranus
achieved over Samuel at the river Spercheius (close to Thermopylae) in
997.<b><a href="#N_57_">[[57]]</a></b> The unexpected glee, relief and
surprise that his victory at Spercheius caused among the Byzantines such
as Leo of Synada reflect just how dangerous Byzantines believed the Bulgarians
to be<b><a href="#N_58_">[[58]]</a></b>
</p><p>Uranus's victory at Spercheius is one of those rare events to which
Scylitzes dedicates a detailed description. However, tracing what happened
in the Balkans after Uranus's triumph from Scylitzes's testimony is more
difficult. Scylitzes makes some superficial dated references to precise
events. In 1000 a large Byzantine army was sent against targets in eastern
Bulgaria including Preslav and Pliska. In 1001 Basil himself led an army
against a series of mountain forts west of Thessalonica. In 1002 Basil
led a campaign against Vidin on the Middle Danube; on his return south
he raided Skopje. Such brief references are usually used to support the
idea that by the early eleventh century Basil had restored Byzantine control
over eastern Bulgaria, the central Danube, and the frontier west of Thessalonica.
It has even been suggested that by 1005 Basil had succeeded in pinning
Samuel back inside the Macedonian Lakes area. Control over the Adriatic
had been re-established through the empire's ally the Doge of Venice, who
by 1000 was calling himself <i>dux</i> of Dalmatia (see below). Meanwhile
the key Adriatic port of Dyrrachium came back into Byzantine hands when
the ruling local family, the Chryselioi, surrendered the city. At this
point, the emperor agreed a ten-year peace deal with Samuel on terms favourable
to the Byzantines.<b><a href="#N_59_">[[59]]</a></b>
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p>There are, however, objections to this neat analysis. First it is not
at all clear that eastern Bulgaria was fully conquered in 1000. Scylitzes
himself construes the campaign of 1000 as a morale boosting assault rather
than a permanent occupation: "in the year 6508 the emperor, having sent
out a heavy force against the Bulgarian castles (<i>kastra</i>) on the
other side of the Haimus [mountains], which was led by the patrician Theodorokan
and the <i>protospatharius</i> Nicephorus Xiphias, took Great and Little
Preslav and Pliska and the Roman army withdrew unharmed and with trophies."<b><a href="#N_60_">[[60]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Indeed, a Bulgarian attack on Adrianople in 1002,&nbsp; while Basil II
was campaigning against Vidin on the Middle Danube, suggests that the struggle
for eastern Bulgaria continued into the early years of the eleventh century.
The first positive sign that Byzantine armies had reoccupied eastern Bulgaria
and taken the Byzantine frontier back up to the Danube comes as late as
1016 with Scylitzes's identification of Tzotzicius as the Byzantine <i>strategus</i>
at Dristra on the Lower Danube.<b><a href="#N_61_">[[61]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Meanwhile, even the forts along the western Macedonian mountain frontier
were probably not permanently conquered. In a later section of his text
when Scylitzes deals with the situation in the Balkans <i>c</i>.1014, we
find locations such as Berrhoia, Servia and Bodina back in Bulgarian hands.<b><a href="#N_62_">[[62]]</a></b>
</p><p>The situation in the Adriatic is equally uncertain. It is unclear whether
Venice's actions can be tied to the Bulgar conflict. John the Deacon, an
exact contemporary, interprets the Venetian action as a unilateral decision
to rid the area of Croat pirates.<b><a href="#N_63_">[[63]]</a></b> Meanwhile,
the status of Dyrrachium is hard to determine for the first two decades
of the eleventh century. References to the city's return to Byzantine rule
occur in an undated chapter in Scylitzes's narrative which is located after
his account of Spercheius.<b><a href="#N_64_">[[64]]</a></b> Yet, the chapter
does not refer to a single episode but instead to a series of events which
have Dyrrachium as a common theme: a description of the city being given
to Ashot Taronites by Samuel; the defection of Ashot back to the Byzantines;
the city's surrender to Basil by the Chryselioi; the arrival of Eustathius
Daphnomeles as the emperor's representative.<b><a href="#N_65_">[[65]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
All of these events have been dated to 1005 on the grounds that Yahya claims
a complete victory for Basil over the Bulgars in this year. Yet, there
is nothing in Scylitzes's testimony to indicate that Dyrrachium was in
Daphnomeles' hands by this point. Instead the reference to Daphnomeles
as commander of the city probably refers to later administrative arrangements
made at the very end of Basil's conflict with the Bulgarians. As Scylitzes
himself indicates, when the Bulgarians surrendered in 1018,&nbsp; Daphnomeles
was given control over Dyrrachium as a reward for defeating a renegade
Bulgarian commander.<b><a href="#N_66_">[[66]]</a></b> The best interpretation
of Scylitzes's earlier Dyrrachium chapter is that it is a thematic unit
with its own internal chronology which stretches across the entire reign.
It is not a single component within a linear chronological narrative of
Basil's wars with Bulgaria.
</p><p>If it is impossible to date the return of Dyrrachium to Byzantine control,&nbsp;
then the arguments that Basil and Samuel agreed to a peace treaty in 1005
look fragile. My own sense is that warfare continued between Basil and
Samuel at a low level for most of the period between 1005 and 1014. Scylitzes
himself alleges that Basil invaded Bulgaria every year, a statement that
I would take to mean that the historian was summarising an excess of material
he found dull rather than fictionalising events which did not occur. It
is, after all, striking just how many other writers from very different
milieus refer to Basil's long wars with the Bulgarians: the author of the
life of St Nikon, al-Rudrawari, Elias of Nisibis, and Ademar of Chabannes.<b><a href="#N_67_">[[67]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is possible that these annual invasions were merely seasonal raids.
The all-year-round campaigns Psellus mentions may only include Basil's
eastern adventures of 999-1000 and 1021-23. Yet, still there is a strong
case for annual raids led by the emperor supported by low level frontier
warfare. As Paul Stephenson has shown,&nbsp; the testimonies of Scylitzes,
Cecaumenus and the Priest of Diocleia are replete with short stories about
warfare and diplomacy among border warlords.<b><a href="#N_68_">[[68]]</a></b>
Certainly, it is in the context of annual campaigns led by the emperor
that Scylitzes refers to the battle of Kleidion, a contest in the passes
near Strumitza north of Thessalonica, during which a Bulgarian blockade
was broken by an attack from the rear by Basil's general Nicephorus Xiphias.
According to one narrative strand in Scylitzes's account this victory was
so overwhelming that Basil blinded fifteen-thousand Bulgarian captives,
an event which caused Samuel to die of a heart attack.<b><a href="#N_69_">[[69]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yet, victory was almost certainly not this complete. Shortly before Kleidion
itself, another Byzantine attack led by Theophylact Botaneiates, <i>dux</i>
of Thessalonica, was heavily defeated. As a result Basil II chose to retreat
rather than follow up his triumph; he only decided to winter in the Balkans
when the death of Samuel was announced to him. But, even then, it still
took four years for Basil to turn victory into final surrender.<b><a href="#N_70_">[[70]]</a></b>
</p><p>In his relatively detailed account of the events which led up to Byzantine
victory in 1018, Scylitzes stresses the punitive raids that were conducted
by Basil's senior generals.<b><a href="#N_71_">[[71]]</a></b> Yet, it is
likely that diplomacy was equally important to Basil's success. Embassies
passed between Basil and a variety of local potentates: Samuel's son Gabriel
Romanus, Samuel's nephew John Vladislav (the son of Aaron), John Vladimir
the prince of Diocleia, and a host of other Bulgarian warlords. This diplomatic
dimension is particularly stressed by the narrative of the Priest of Diocleia
who accuses Basil of persuading John Vladislav to murder Gabriel Radomir.<b><a href="#N_72_">[[72]]</a></b>
Whether or not Basil lay behind the murder of Gabriel in 1015, he continued
to face a hostile Bulgarian state led by Gabriel's assassin John Vladislav.
Basil responded with brutal force and hidden diplomacy. The emperor invaded
Bulgaria, plundered western Macedonia, and once again blinded all his Bulgarian
prisoners. Vladislav himself was eventually killed in 1018 in battle outside
the city of Dyrrachium, the event which finally persuaded the Bulgarian
royal family and senior army commanders to surrender to the emperor.<b><a href="#N_73_">[[73]]</a></b>
Yahya ibn Sa'id records that when the Bulgarian dignitaries surrendered
to Basil they were sent to Constantinople and given Byzantine brides.<b><a href="#N_74_">[[74]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
However, it is Scylitzes who records the surrenders in greatest detail,
possibly because at the time when he was writing many Byzantine aristocrats
claimed descent from the Bulgarian royal family, particularly the branch
represented by John Vladislav.<b><a href="#N_75_">[[75]]</a></b>&nbsp;
This surrender clearly involved much public spectacle, as did Basil's celebration
of his 'victory': Basil first journeyed through Macedonia receiving submissions
from the Bulgar leaders and acclaim from his army. A stage was especially
constructed for these shows. Then he went to Athens to give thanks at the
Church of the Virgin (the Parthenon). Finally he returned to Constantinople,
where he entered the city in triumph wearing a crown of victory (<i>toupha</i>)
and displaying the human and material booty he had acquired from his Balkan
'conquest'.<b><a href="#N_76_">[[76]]</a></b>
</p><p>The administration of Bulgaria after Basil's conquest is difficult to
reconstruct. Scylitzes presents a picture of military rule: old fortifications
were seized; new castles were built; senior commanders heroically continued
the conquest in more remote areas. However, other evidence suggests that
just as on the eastern frontier, Basil preferred to govern with a relatively
light hand. Apart from a permanent garrison at Skopje operating under the
authority of a regional military commander, Byzantium's military presence
in the Balkans was soon modified. Garrisons briefly installed at renovated
Late Roman forts on the Middle Danube were soon withdrawn, if not by Basil
himself then by his immediate successors.<b><a href="#N_77_">[[77]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Many fortifications were dismantled during Basil's own reign.<b><a href="#N_78_">[[78]]</a></b>&nbsp;
Meanwhile, just as in the east Basil disdained fiscal and administrative
dislocation. Former Byzantine prisoners of war settled in Bulgaria by Samuel
were allowed to retain their holdings rather than rejoin the Byzantine
army. The local population continued to be taxed in kind. The emperor appointed
<i>basilikoi
</i>to
manage local finances. In the east such figures were often local notables.<b><a href="#N_79_">[[79]]</a></b>&nbsp;
It has still to be established whether the same was true in the Bulgarian
sphere. However, if a parallel can be drawn between ecclesiastical and
financial administration then it is likely that financial bureaucracy was
devolved to locals. In the episcopal field Basil deprived the Bulgarian
church of its status as an independent patriarchate, but granted the metropolitan
of Ochrid an autocephalous position and control over several neighbouring
bishoprics. This metropolitan was a local.<b><a href="#N_80_">[[80]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The use of more Constantinopolitan officials and introduction of cash taxes
were unpopular innovations introduced only after Basil's death.

<p>While a lack of sustained narratives stymie an understanding of Byzantium's
relations with Bulgaria in Basil II's reign, the history of Byzantine activity
in southern Italy is somewhat easier to piece together from annals and
archive documents. Such evidence has been used in recent years to inquire
into the administration of Byzantine southern Italy in the tenth and eleventh
centuries.<b><a href="#N_81_">]]81]]</a></b>&nbsp; Less extensive research
has been done on the politics of the region between 972, the year when
Otto II married the Byzantine princess Theophano and the mid eleventh century.
Gay was the last historian to write about southern Italy in Basil's reign.
His view was that civil wars in Byzantium and conflict in Bulgaria kept
Basil's attention away from southern Italy until the final decade of his
reign.<b><a href="#N_82_">[[82]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; There is some evidence
however, to suggest that Basil's enthusiasm for Byzantine southern Italy
and for diplomatic relations with other western states was more pronounced
than Gay imagined.
</p><p>During the first half of Basil's reign Byzantine southern Italy was
regularly attacked by the Muslims of Sicily and North Africa. Brief entries
in local annals and saints' lives record how such raids regularly devastated
large areas. In 986 Gerace in Calabria was occupied briefly and the walls
of Cosenze destroyed; in 988 and 1003-4 Bari was threatened; in 1009 Cosenze
was reoccupied. In 992 a landowner from Conversano talked of the 'misery'
that such raids brought to the hinterland of Bari.<b><a href="#N_83_">[[83]]</a></b>
Such raids affected not only Byzantine provinces but other areas of southern
and central Italy too. It was ostensibly to deal with this Arab threat
that the German emperor Otto II invaded Byzantine southern Italy in 982.
The Byzantines neither supported nor opposed this invasion. When Otto was
eventually defeated it was by the emir of Sicily at Stilo in Byzantine
Calabria.
</p><p>Until 1018 the Byzantines preferred to contain Muslim attacks rather
than take the offensive. Nonetheless, they did not abandon southern Italy.
Senior army commanders from Constantinople were dispatched throughout Basil's
reign to act as governors. A garrison of troops from the main Byzantine
field army was constantly deployed at Bari, the main Byzantine administrative
centre. Active diplomacy was also pursued. The protection of southern Italy
was one context for Byzantino-Venetian relations. A marriage deal was struck
early in the eleventh century between the Doge's son and Maria Argyra,
the daughter of a prominent member of Basil's court. In 1003/4 Venice helped
to defend Bari from Arab siege. But Venice was not Byzantium's only Italian
naval ally. In 1006 the Pisans contributed to a Byzantine victory off Reggio.<b><a href="#N_84_">[[84]]</a></b>
Indeed the Byzantines may also have looked further afield than Italy for
naval support including to the Umayyads of southern Spain, who were themselves
adversaries of the Muslims of Sicily and North Africa. Basil may also have
attempted to use more direct diplomatic channels to mitigate the impact
of Muslim attacks. The survival of a list of gifts sent from the emperor
to the emir of Sicily suggests that the emperor tried to bribe the local
Arabs into ceasing hostilities.<b><a href="#N_85_">[[85]]</a></b>
</p><p>The surviving chronicles indicate that the worst of the Arab raids were
over after the first decade of the eleventh century. Yet, after this the
Byzantines faced a new problem: internal revolt, especially the insurrection
led by Meles, a rich citizen from Bari. The first mention of this revolt
comes in 1009 when Meles led a local conspiracy against the catepan (governor)
John Curcuas. This revolt was suppressed within a year by Curcuas's successor
Basil Mesardonites, possibly with support from a fleet led by Basil Argyrus,
the <i>strategus</i> of Samos. Six years later, however, revolt broke out
again, after Meles had built an alliance of outside protagonists who included
the Lombard rulers of Capua-Beneventum, and a motley assortment of Norman
mercenaries and pilgrims. Together they defeated a Byzantine army led by
the catepan Contoleo Tornicius. In December 1017 reinforcements arrived
led by a new catepan, Basil Boiannes. Meles was soon defeated.&nbsp;&nbsp;
A few years later, in 1025, Boiannes took part in a campaign against Sicily.
He joined the eunuch commander Orestes, a veteran of the Bulgar campaign,
who had sailed with an advance party of troops and landed in Messina. Basil
II's death, however, meant that the main expeditionary force did not set
off and the mission against Sicily failed.
</p><p>The arrival of Boiannes in southern Italy is usually seen as the beginning
of a more offensive Byzantine policy. Boiannes was particularly active
in consolidating Byzantine authority in the Troia, a wasteland bordering
the territories of the Lombard princes to the north. Forts were built;
garrisons were installed. Pandulf, the Lombard prince of Capua, became
a Byzantine client and participated in joint Lombard-Byzantine military
actions. Yet, it is possible that rather than being a new initiative, Boiannes's
actions were merely a stage in a gradual re-imposition of Byzantine authority
in southern Italy which had been underway for much of the second half of
Basil's reign. There are several signs of a long-term strengthening of
the Byzantine position. Several commanders sent from Constantinople after
995 served for very long periods: Gregory Tarchaneiotes (998-1006); Basil
Mesardonites (1010-1016); Boiannes (1017-c.1028). This contrasts with the
turbulent early years of Basil's reign when many senior officers in the
region served for only a few months (Calocyrus Delphinas: 982-3; John Amiropulus:
988-9). Nor was Boiannes the first catepan to flex his muscles among neighbouring
Lombard princes. In 1011, after the first Meles revolt had been crushed,
Basil Mesardonites had conducted a progress through Lombard territory.
Greater Constantinopolitan interest in southern Italy may also be visible
in the region's architectural record. Art historians have detected metropolitan
support for the building of a series of large basilical churchs at Bari,
Taranto, Bovino and Vieste in the early eleventh century.<b><a href="#N_86_">[[86]]</a></b>
</p><p>Nonetheless, while Constantinople may have taken a greater interest
in southern Italy as Basil's reign progressed, it is important not to overstate
the case. In the first place it is clear that when the region came under
sustained attack, as was the case in 1021-2 during an invasion by the German
emperor Henry II, there was very little that the Byzantine senior commanders
could do except wait patiently in Bari until the enemy's alliances with
local Lombard princes fell apart and concerns beyond the Alps diverted
their energies northwards again. Furthermore, it is clear that in southern
Italy as on other Byzantine frontiers during Basil's reign, imperial authority
had to adapt to local administrative practices, indigenous bureaucrats
and provincial power structures. Even in the Troia Byzantine authority
was based as much on encouraging local Lombards to settle as on building
new fortifications. Yet the wisdom of this outlook was soon visible. Local
charters record a surge in economic activity in the Troia including the
excavation of irrigation canals, the erection of mills and cultivation
of vines.<sup> </sup><b><a href="#N_87_">[[87]]</a></b>
</p><p>Further afield, Byzantine relations with other western states were almost
exclusively characterised by diplomacy rather than military might. This
was certainly true of relations between Basil and the German empire in
the decades between Otto II's disastrous expedition of 982 and Henry II's
invasion in 1021. As early as 991 Otto III, son of Otto II and the Greek
princess Theophano, sent two embassies to Byzantium with requests for an
imperial bride. The progress of these marriage negotiations in the later
990s is illuminated by the letters of Leo of Synada, the Byzantine envoy
to the Ottonians. They not only indicate how intense diplomatic contacts
could be at this time, but also highlight the complex web of rivalry and
co-operation which typified Byzantino-Ottonian relations. Competition for
control over and influence in Rome was particularly fierce. At one point
during Leo's embassy (996-998) the Byzantines backed an alliance between
the Crescenti, a local Roman family, and Otto's tutor Philagathus, a Greek
from southern Italy. Together they deposed Otto III's candidate Gregory
V and declared Philagathus Pope.<b><a href="#N_88_">[[88]]</a></b> Although
Otto returned to Rome, reinstalled Gregory, and later appointed Gerbert
of Aurillac as Pope Sylvester II, he found it difficult to impose full
control over the city. After Otto died in 1002,&nbsp; relations between
the Ottonians and Basil become harder to trace, although in 1021-1022 Byzantine
and German interests once again clashed as Henry II invaded southern Italy.
</p><p>The surviving source materials mean that we know more about Byzantine
contacts with Germany than with any other western power during Basil's
reign. Yet contacts may also have been established with other states north
of the Alps. Nascent western aristocratic and royal families consistently
tried to associate themselves with Byzantine imperial splendour and charisma.
In 988 Hugh, the first Capetian king of France, requested a Byzantine bride
from Basil II for his son. By the 1020s and 1030s aristocratic pilgrims
began to appear regularly at the Byzantine court in Constantinople on their
way to Jerusalem. Meetings with the Byzantine emperor usually yielded gifts
of fine fabrics and even relics, charismatic items to be taken back to
northern Europe and used in the adornment of family monasteries.<b><a href="#N_89_">[[89]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b>The North: Rus</b></p></center>

<p>Basil II's reign is significant in many different respects. It marked
the high water point in the medieval history of Byzantium. It brought Bulgaria
within the Byzantine political sphere. It resonates through the modern
history of the Balkans as Greek, Bulgarian and Macedonian nationalists
have used and abused Basil's personality and achievements in the construction
and destruction of national claims. But it is in connection with the long-term
history and identities of the Russians that Basil's reign, almost by accident,
enters world history. For it was during Basil's reign in 988 that Vladimir
prince of Kiev converted to Orthodox Christianity. Even if, as historians
now believe, there were many Rus conversions in this period and many Rus
principalities, the importance of 988 lay in the fact that the <i>Russian
Primary Chronicle</i>, compiled in its current form in the early twelfth
century, chose to record the conversion of Vladimir as the seminal moment
in the creation of Kiev, that principality to which all others eventually
became subordinate.
</p><p>But while the<i> Russian Primary Chronicle</i> dedicates extensive coverage
to the events surrounding the conversion of Vladimir<b><a href="#N_90_">[[90]]</a></b>,
it is striking that historians writing from within the Byzantine empire
registered little interest in the acceptance of Christianity among the
Rus. Scylitzes notes the context to the conversion of the Rus: the marriage
of Basil's sister Anna to Vladimir and the arrival of Rus troops to fight
Bardas Phocas in the late 980s. But he says nothing of the conversion itself.
Indeed it is only the Arab historians who make it clear that Vladimir's
acceptance of Christianity was part of a nexus of arrangements with the
Byzantines involving a marriage and the dispatch of mercenaries.
</p><p>There are, however, objections to this neat analysis.&nbsp; First it
is not clear that Eastern Bulgaria was fully conquered in 1000.&nbsp; Scylitzes
himself construes the campaign of 1000 as a morale boosting as part of
this aforementioned nexus.&nbsp; Such a fragmented source base means that
the precise chronology and the detail of the component events of Vladimir's
conversion remain highly contested. Particularly uncertain is the motivation
for the Rus attack on the Byzantine outpost of Cherson in the Crimea shortly
after Vladimir had sent troops to Basil. Was it a friendly action on the
part of Vladimir, who was determined to help his brother-in-law Basil against
Phocas'&nbsp; supporters in Cherson? Or was it that Vladimir grew tired
when Basil failed to dispatch Anna in accordance with the agreement struck
between the two rulers?<b><a href="#N_91_">[[91]]</a></b>
</p><p>The enormous scholarly effort applied to understanding Byzantine-Rus
relations at the time of the conversion itself is in some senses a reflection
of modern preoccupations with the birth of a nation.<b><a href="#N_92_">[[92]]</a></b>&nbsp;
It also reflects the fact that most of the medieval written evidence about
Byzantino-Rus relations in Basil's reign clusters around these events.
References outside the Slavonic record to other Rus activities in Basil's
reign are extremely rare and somewhat inconsequential. Scylitzes records
two apparently random episodes: a joint Byzantino-Rus attack on Khazaria
in 1016 involving Sphengos the brother of Vladimir; and the adventures
of Chrysocheir, another relative of Vladimir, who came to Byzantium towards
the end of Basil's reign as a mercenary. On his arrival in Constantinople
he argued with imperial authorities, attacked Abydus and was eventually
defeated at sea off the island of Lemnos. Other historians of Basil's reign
mention of the presence of Rus mercenaries in Byzantine armies all over
the empire.<b><a href="#N_93_">[[93]]</a></b>
</p><p>Yet, while references such as these are elusive, they suggest that Vladimir's
acceptance of Christianity had the very practical impact of strengthening
and extending long-standing strategic, religious and commercial ties between
the Byzantines and Rus. The <i>Russian Primary Chronicle</i>, Byzantine
chronicle and administrative texts, and archaeological evidence all demonstrate
that such connections had begun to develop long before Vladimir converted.
Rus trade routes from Kiev to Constantinople down the Dniepr river had
been exploited from the early tenth century. Rus troops had participated
in Byzantine expeditions to southern Italy (935) and Crete (949, 961).
Vladimir's grandmother Olga had negotiated with the Byzantine court in
the course of converting to Christianity (946 or 957). Such ties were considerably
strengthened by Vladimir's own conversion. At the most obvious level Vladimir's
conversion precipitated a growing traffic in religious personnel and objects.
Priests, bishops, artists, architects, precious objects were all transported
to Kiev. Some were sent by Basil as gifts; others were bought or employed
by Vladimir; some were more brutally sequestered, in particular at the
Rus sack of Cherson. But besides religious contact, pragmatic links also
grew exponentially. In addition to the greater use of Rus mercenaries in
Byzantine armies, trading connections seem to have blossomed. Archaeological
evidence suggests that islands in the Dniepr estuary, once prohibited to
Rus merchants, became active trading stations. Vast numbers of fragments
of Byzantine imported amphorae, glass and jewellery have been discovered.
It has been suggested that one reason why Vladimir inaugurated an ambitious
building programme of earthworks and fortified settlements around Kiev
was to protect Rus ships bound for Constantinople from nomad attack. Greeks
who were skilled in baking bricks seem to have built the forts.<b><a href="#N_94_">[[94]]</a></b>
</p><p>Finally, while Basil may initially have been reluctant to send his sister
Anna to Kiev and to support Rus conversion, there are signs that for the
rest of his reign, he monitored and exploited political events north of
the Black Sea for his own ends. Thietmar of Merseberg indicates that when
Boleslav, king of Poland, entered Kiev on behalf of the Rus prince Sviatopluk
in 1015, he immediately sent envoys to inform Constantinople of what had
happened.<b><a href="#N_95_">[[95]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; It has also been
argued that Byzantium's joint expedition with Sphengos against Khazaria
in 1016 could be interpreted as a Black Sea naval alliance struck between
Basil and another princely competitor for supremacy among the Rus, perhaps
Mstislav of Tmutokoran. 'Khazaria' in this case may refer to the Kasogian,
peoples of the Kuban and northern Caucasus region whom it is known from
other sources were conquered by Mstislav.<b><a href="#N_96_">[[96]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In a characteristically muddled passage Scylitzes alleges that the Rus
and Byzantines captured the local ruler George Tzoulas. It is unlikely
that Tzoulas was the leader of the Kasogians; he may, however, have been
a notable at the Byzantine outpost of Cherson. The Tzoulas family are known
from seal evidence to have been prominent in the Byzantine Crimea.<b><a href="#N_97_">[[97]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
While it is difficult to say why the expedition attacked Cherson, the important
general point is that in the decades which separated Rus conversion from
Basil's death, Byzantine and Rus relations blossomed and multiplied at
many different levels.
</p><center>
<p><b>The End of the Reign</b></p></center>

<p>When Basil died in 1025 he left the Byzantine empire with strong frontiers.
He had imposed imperial authority on frontier territories and on the empire's
neighbours with a mixture of force and diplomacy. Basil used warfare most
extensively in Bulgaria. Elsewhere he preferred if possible to use diplomacy.
However, even where he deployed force to conquer territories, he was often
happy to consolidate imperial rule through the use of indigenous civil
administrators and local fiscal and ecclesiastical practices. There is
little sign that Basil's style of governance was rejected. Obituaries in
eastern sources refer to the emperor's astute management of his empire
and his sound political sense. In this context recent arguments that Basil's
campaigns and conquests overstretched the empire's resources and led inexorably
to collapse in the eleventh century seem misplaced (see above). It was
the political and administrative inability of Basil's successors to manage
an expanded empire rather than expansion itself which contributed to collapse.&nbsp;
In this sense there is much to be said for Michael Psellus' allegations
in the <i>Chronographia </i>that the decline of Byzantium stemmed from
the irrespondibility of the successors of the iron emperor.
</p><p>Yet, for all the favourable obituaries that Basil earned, it is clear
that he faced considerable opposition at the very end of his reign. This
is something which Michael Psellus does not mention in his account of Basil's
reign, perhaps because he did not want to disturb the perfect equilibrium
of his imperial portrait. Psellus's depiction of the sybaritic dilettante
turned by harsh circumstance into a military man of steel could not allow
for failure in the emperor's waning years. More difficult, however, than
explaining why Psellus concealed the problems which occurred in the sunset
of Basil's career is determining precisely what those problems were and
why they occurred.
</p><p>The most serious insurrection that Basil faced at the end of his reign
occurred in central Anatolia during the course of his campaign against
the Georgians. It was led by Nicephorus Xiphias and Nicephorus Phocas in
1021-2.<b><a href="#N_98_">[[98]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; So serious was this
revolt that when it was eventually crushed by Theophylact Dalassenus, the
strategus of the Anatolicon, Basil had the head of Phocas brought to the
imperial camp on the Georgian border and paraded among the troops. Xiphias
was stripped of office and sent to a monastery. Some historians have interpreted
these events as a return of the inexorable threat of the powerful families;
the financial and manpower resources of clans like the Phocades proved
too strong for the emperor. Yet, I would argue against this reading. Careful
analysis of the many narratives that comment on this revolt make it clear
that this revolt was not in fact fomented by the Phocades, but instead
by Nicephorus Xiphias, one of Basil's most consistently loyal generals,
believed by many to have been responsible for Basil II's victory at Kleidion.<b><a href="#N_99_">[[99]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Indeed these sources demonstrate that Xiphias was the organiser who simply
used Phocas as a famous name to 'front' his revolt. What this then suggests
is that rather than being about the return of the 'powerful' famlies, the
Xiphias-Phocas revolt was about a bid for power by a senior general in
the twilight years of Basil's reign. At issue in 1021-2 was a long-standing
tension: control over the army. Since the turn of the century Basil had
been in control. But as the emperor approached his seventieth birthday,
challenges were bound to occur.<b><a href="#N_100_">[[100]]</a></b>
</p><p>There were other signs that the end of Basil's reign was characterised
by worries about who was going to control the main instruments of state
when the emperor died. According to the Armenian historian Aristakes Lastivert,
so great was the uncertainty in that the emperor went on parade through
the city of Constantinople to reassure the citizens that he was still alive.
One obvious reason for such uncertainty was the fact that Basil had no
heir except his aged brother Constantine, who himself had three unmarried,
childless, and middle-aged daughters. More important,&nbsp; few of Basil's
senior advisors wanted Constantine to become emperor. They even discouraged
Basil from summoning Constantine to the imperial palace when he was on
his deathbed.<b><a href="#N_101_">[[101]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The extent
to which Constantine ever played an active role in imperial governance
during Basil's reign is unclear. Psellus suggests that he was removed from
power at some point in the first half of Basil's reign.<b><a href="#N_102_">[[102]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Modern historians, however, sometimes suggest that Constantine may have
exercised considerable authority particularly in Constantinople and the
imperial palace.<b><a href="#N_103_">[[103]]</a></b> My own view is that
Constantine had rarely fulfilled more than a ceremonial role. He certainly
did not control the palace at the end of Basil's reign. Instead the most
important Constantinopolitan official was John the <i>protonotarius</i>.<b><a href="#N_104_">[[104]]</a></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
It was individuals like John who were concerned lest power was about to
be handed over to a senile cipher. And it may have been such uncertainty
about the future which explains why Basil continued to campaign and plan
new offensives until his death. Endless fighting was the only way of keeping
control of the levers of state power. Maintaining control, in particular
over the army, may also have dictated the emperor's rather unusual choice
of burial place. Rather than being buried in the elaborate tomb that he
had prepared for himself in the Mausoleum of Constantine in the Church
of the Holy Apostles, Basil suddenly decided to be interred in the church
of the monastery of St John the Evangelist, that he had refounded, outside
the walls of the city at the Hebdomon, close to the imperial parade grounds.
In death as in life Basil could keep watch over his troops.<b><a href="#N_105_">[[105]]</a></b>
</p><p>Basil's epitaph stressed his lifetime's vigilance in guarding the frontiers
to east and west (see above). In practice, though, Basil had realised that
watching the frontiers could take many forms other than martial strength.
Diplomacy and devolution of power were also crucial. It was a combination
of skill and luck which meant that in the second half of his reign Basil
was able to choose where he fought and where he ruled by indirect means.
The crucial difference between Basil and many of his successors, particularly
those who ruled Byzantium after 1050, was that few of them enjoyed this
luxury of choice. Instead they found themselves faced with a triple assault
on three frontiers: from Normans in the west, Pechenegs in the north and
Turks in the east.

was seventy. This would mean that Basil was born some time around 956.
