<h3>Early Life</h3>







<p>Titus was born on 30 December A.D. 39 in Rome, one of three children of



<b><a href="vespasia.htm&quot;">Vespasian</a></b>, Roman emperor (A.D. 69-79), and Domitilla I, daughter of a



treasury clerk. .<b><a href="#1">[[1]]</a></b> The family's circumstances were modest, but began to



improve during the emperorship of Claudius (A.D. 41-54), under whom



<b><a href="vespasia.html">Vespasian</a></b> advanced rapidly. His ascent likely played a role in securing the



honor of a court education for Titus, who studied with the emperor's own



son, Britannicus.  The two remained close friends until Britannicus' death



in A.D. 55 under <a href="nero.html"><b>Nero</b></a>.  In affection for his boyhood mate, Titus later



preserved his memory by setting up golden statues of him in the palace and



by routinely accompanying another statue in processions in the Circus. .<b><a href="#2">[[2]]</a></b>



The intellectual advantages of a palace education, with its emphasis on



Greek and Latin literature and declamation, and of a father who had



attained the rank of consul, placed Titus firmly upon the path of a young



senator.  His early posts remain obscure but, perhaps as early as A.D. 61,



he served as a military tribune in Upper Germany and Britain, the same



provinces in which his father had served as a legionary legate..<b><a href="#3">[[3]]</a></b>  While



in Britain, Titus is said to have saved <b><a href="vespasia.html">Vespasian</a></b>'s life; another source



records numerous busts and statues in Britain and Germany commemorating his



achievements.  The accounts lack historical basis but are typical of the



fondness of later historians for exaggerating Titus' qualities and



achievements..<b><a href="#4"> [[4]]</a></b></p>



<p>Returning to Rome in the early months of A.D. 64, Titus practiced law, most



likely with the intention of advancing his own reputation.  Little is known



of his political career after his return from Britain.  In all likelihood,



he advanced through the offices typically held by a young senator.  It was



during this year that he married Arrecina Tertulla.  Her background remains



obscure, and not long after the marriage, Arrecina died.  Soon thereafter,



Titus married Marcia Furnilla.  The marriage represented a notable success



for the Flavians, as Marcia was of a noble family, the granddaughter of a



former proconsul of Africa.  Suspicions of political intrigue were ever



present in first-century Rome, however, and when Marcia's family fell into



disfavor with <a href="nero.html"><b>Nero</b></a>, the brief marriage ended in divorce.  The sources agree



that a daughter, Julia, was born, yet it is not clear whether she belonged



to Titus' first or second marriage.  At any rate, Julia's subsequent life



was miserable; she is said to have died in her mid-twenties of an abortion



forced upon her by Titus' brother and successor, <b><a href="domitian.html">Domitian</a></b>, in the late



eighties A.D.<b><a href="#5">[[5]]</a></b></p>











<h3>Judaean Campaigns</h3>











<p>In A.D. 66 <a href="nero.html"><b>Nero</b></a> 



granted to <a href="vespasia.html"> <b>Vespasian </b></a>a special command in the East with the



task of settling the revolt in <a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;mas_jr70.jpg&quot;,&quot;w3adIQBAQJAI&quot;,&quot;width=474,height=528&quot;)"><b>Judaea</b></a>.  The immediate cause of the war was



rioting in Cesaraea and Jerusalem, leading to the slaughter in the latter



city of Jewish leaders and Roman soldiers.  In response to the crisis, the



emperor placed the seven legions in Syria under <a href="vespasia.html"><b>Vespasian' s</b></a> authority and



named Titus as legate of the 15th legion of Apollo, the <i>legio XV



Apollinaris.</i>  The appointment was unusual, for Titus had not yet held the



praetorship, a judicial post normally held by a senator before he became a



legionary commander.  At the very least, both appointments reflected <a href="nero.html"><b>Nero</b></a>'s



confidence in father and son.</p>



<p>It is difficult to assess Titus' role in the campaigns of A.D. 67-68.  The



main source, the <i>Jewish Wars</i> by Josephus, a Jew with strong Roman



sympathies, consistently portrays him in highly favorable terms.  Titus



did figure prominently in the subjugation of at least five rebel centers



during this period, but he never wholly subdued any town that had its own



defenses.  When stripped of Josephus' enhancements, therefore, Titus'



accomplishments seem more modest.<b><a href="#6">[[6]]</a></b>  Nevertheless, he capably performed



the tasks assigned to him and, in the process, projected the image of a



daring and successful military leader.  While not entirely accurate, the



portrait is not completely surprising either, for as the son of the supreme



commander Titus would have enjoyed more attention than was typically



accorded an ordinary quaestorian legionary legate.</p>



<p>With the death of <a href="nero.html"><b>Nero</b></a> in A.D. 68, the Flavians methodically plotted toward



the imperial throne. Little is heard of Titus during this critical period.



He likely helped to consolidate support for the Flavians in the East by



negotiating with the likes of Gaius Licinius Mucianus, governor of Syria.



Even so, it was Vespasian who remained in charge.  By mid-July, A.D. 69,



legions in Judaea, Egypt, and Syria had declared for him.  The Danubian



legions soon followed, and on 21 December, the day after the emperor



<a href="vitell.html"><b>Vitellius'</b></a> death,



 the senate conferred all the usual powers on <a href="vespasia.html"><b>Vespasian</b></a>.



Following these events, Titus remained in the East to undertake the siege



of Jerusalem, the exploit for which he is most remembered.  Beset by



violent factional strife and internal discord, Jerusalem was a stubborn



obstacle to the Roman pacification of Judaea.  Built on two hills and



surrounded by walls, the city's fortifications were formidable.  With four



legions under his command, Titus began an assault on the city in spring,



A.D. 70.  In less than four weeks, his forces had breached the walls of the



so-called New City, or suburb of Bezetha.  Only the inner city and the



Temple itself remained to be taken.  A siege wall was quickly built around



the city, and the circumvallation had the desired effect of increasing



starvation.  By August, the outer Temple court had been reached and, in the



ensuing attack, the Temple was burned to the ground and all captives



butchered.  Titus was hailed as <i>imperator</i> by his troops.  In a final



desecration to the Temple, sacrifice was made to the Roman standards in the



Temple court.<b><a href="#7">[[7]]</a></b></p>



<p>Titus' use of defense walls, towers, catapults, and battering rams in



overtaking the city - all traditional Roman military tactics - demonstrated



that he was a capable, but not an innovative, military leader.  In



addition, he had sometimes displayed a reckless intervention, especially in



the early stages of the siege. .<b><a href="#8">[[8]]</a></b>  These flaws owed more to inexperience



than  to military incompetence, however, and as a counter-balance Titus



displayed remarkable energy in the field and the ability to inspire deep



loyalty in his troops.   As a result, Jerusalem was efficiently, if not



brutally, overcome and the campaign in Judaea was effectively won.



Titus spent the winter of A.D. 70 touring the East with a splendid retinue



of  legionaries and prisoners, presumably to provide a public display of



Flavian military prowess and to underscore the consequences of rebellion



against his father by the punishments inflicted on Jewish prisoners.  Here



he revealed a sympathy for brutality and humiliation, most evident in the



way in which Jews were thrown to wild beasts or forced to fight each other



in shows for public enjoyment.  Indiscretion also played a part in his



activities, particularly in his dalliance with Berenice, the thrice-married



sister of M. Julius Agrippa II, an Eastern monarch with a strong allegiance



to Rome.  Powerful, wealthy, and experienced in Eastern affairs, Berenice



was a formidable match for Titus.  Yet, as Cleopatra's relationship with



Mark Antony had earlier shown, involvement with an Eastern queen



represented a threat to Roman stability that could not be tolerated.



Marriage remained an impossibility.  Even so, Berenice visited Rome in A.D.



75 with her brother and openly lived with Titus for a time, although he



dismissed her, with mutual regret, upon his accession to the throne..<b><a href="#9"> [[9]]</a></b></p>











<h3>Role Under Vespasian</h3>











<p>Titus returned to Rome in June, A.D. 71 and participated in a lavish joint



triumph with <a href="vespasia.html"><b>Vespasian</b></a> to celebrate the Judaean campaign.  The joint



celebration was deliberate, as <a href="vespasia.html"><b>Vespasian </b></a>wished to waste no time in



establishing an heir-apparent to the throne.  Consequently, Titus shared in



virtually every honor with the emperor during the seventies A.D., including



the tribunician power, seven joint-consulships, and a share of the office



of censor.  In A.D. 72, Titus was also appointed praetorian prefect with



responsibility for the army at Rome, a particularly important post since



military loyalty was indispensable to the success of the new regime.  It



seems clear that not only did <a href="vespasia.html"><b>Vespasian</b></a> need a trusted colleague in this



post but also one who would do his dirty work.  Tradition records that



Titus was skilled as a forger.  We also learn that he was "somewhat



arrogant and tyrannical" in that he tried suspicious characters in the



theater and camp "by popular pressure and not by trial.".<b><a href="#10"> [[10]]</a></b>  A certain



amount of bad press was to be expected for the regime's enforcer, but only



a single instance of justice of this kind survives, making any further



evaluation of Titus' role difficult.<b><a href="#11">[[11]]</a></b>  On the other hand, Titus was also



portrayed during these years as a capable and diligent administrator who



attended senate meetings, requested advice, and generally mixed well with



all parties.  At the same time, the sources offer no indication that he was



ever considered a "co-ruler' with <a href="vespasia.html"><b>Vespasian</b></a>, and it was only upon the



latter's death on 24 June, A.D. 79 that Titus assumed full imperial powers.</p>











<h3>Titus' Reign</h3>











<p>Before becoming emperor, tradition records that Titus was feared as the



next <a href="nero.html"><b>Nero</b></a>, a perception that may have developed from his association with



Berenice, his alleged heavy-handedness as praetorian prefect, and tales of



sexual debauchery..<b><a href="#12"> [[12]]</a></b>  Once in office, however, both emperor and his



reign were portrayed in universally positive terms.  The suddenness of this



transformation raises immediate suspicions, yet it is difficult to know



whether the historical tradition is suspect or if Titus was in fact adept



at taking off one mask for another. What is clear, however, is that Titus



sought to present the Flavians as the legitimate successors of the



Julio-Claudian dynasty.  Proof came through the issuing of a series of



restoration coins of previous emperors, the most popular being Augustus and



Claudius.  In A.D. 80 Titus also set out to establish an imperial cult in



honor of <a href="vespasia.html"><b>Vespasian</b></a>.  The temple, in which cult (the first that was not connected with the



Julio-Claudians) was housed, was completed by <a href="domitian.html"><b>Domitian</b></a> and was known as the Temple of



Vespasian and Domitian.</p>



<p>Legitimacy was also sought through various economic measures, which Titus



enthusiastically funded.  Vast amounts of capital poured into extensive



building schemes in Rome, especially the Flavian Amphitheater, popularly



known as the Colosseum.  In celebration of additions made to the structure,



Titus provided a grand 100-day festival, with sea fights staged on an



artificial lake, infantry battles, wild beast hunts, and similar



activities.  He also constructed new imperial baths to the south-east of



the Amphitheater and began work on the celebrated Arch of Titus, a memorial



to his Jewish victories..<b><a href="#13"> [[13]]</a></b>  Large sums were directed to Italy and the



provinces as well, especially for road building. In response to the



eruption of Vesuvius in A.D. 79, Titus spent large sums to relieve distress



in that area; likewise, the imperial purse contributed heavily to



rebuilding Rome after a devastating fire destroyed large sections of the



city in A.D. 80.  As a result of these actions, Titus earned a reputation



for generosity and geniality.  Even so, his financial acumen must not be



under-estimated.  He left the treasury with a surplus, as he had found it,



and dealt promptly and efficiently with costly natural disasters.  The



Greek historian of the third-century A.D., Cassius Dio, perhaps offered the



most accurate and succinct assessment of Titus' economic policy: "In money



matters, Titus was frugal and made no unnecessary expenditure.".<b><a href="#14"> [[14]]</a></b>



In other areas, the brevity of Titus' reign limits our ability to detect



major emphases or trends in policy.  As far as can be discerned from the



limited evidence, senior officials and <i>amici</i> were well chosen, and his



legislative activity tended to focus on popular social measures, with the



army as a particular beneficiary in the areas of land ownership, marriage,



and testamentary freedom.  In the provinces, Titus continued his father's



policies by strengthening roads and forts in the East and along the Danube.</p>











<h3>Death and Assessment</h3>











<p>Titus died in September, A.D. 81 after only 26 months in office.  Suetonius



recorded that Titus died on his way to the Sabine country of his ancestors



in the same villa as his father..<b><a href="#15"> [[15]]</a></b>  A competing tradition persistently



implicated his brother and successor, <a href="domitian.html"><b>Domitian</b></a>, as having had a hand in the



emperor's demise, but the evidence is highly contradictory and any



wrongdoing is difficult to prove..<b><a href="#16">[[16]]</a></b>  <a href="domitian.html"><b>Domitian</b></a> himself delivered the



funeral eulogy and had Titus deified.  He also built several monuments in



honor of Titus and completed the Temple of <a href="vespasia.html"><b>Vespasian</b></a> and Titus, changing



the name of the structure to include his brother's and setting up his cult



statue in the Temple itself.</p>







<p>Titus was the beneficiary of considerable intelligence and talent,



endowments that were carefully cultivated at every step of his career, from



his early education to his role under his father's principate.  Cassius Dio



suggested that Titus' reputation was enhanced by his early death.<b><a href="#17"> [[17]]</a></b>  It



is true that the ancient sources tend to heroicize Titus, yet based upon the



evidence, his reign must be considered a positive one.   He capably



continued the work of his father in establishing the Flavian dynasty and he



maintained a high degree of economic and administrative competence in Italy



and beyond.  In so doing, he solidified the role of the emperor as



paternalistic autocrat, a model that would serve Trajan and his successors



well.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>



<p><a name="1"></a>[[1]] The main ancient sources for Titus' life are: Suet. <em>Tit</em>.; Dio 66.17-26;



Jos.<u> BJ</u>.  On his birthdate, see Philocalus in<em> CIL</em> I, p. 356; for December



28:<em> PIR</em><sup>2</sup> F 399.  Suetonius assigns the date to the year of Gaius'



assassination (24 Jan. A.D. 41), but later contradicts himself at <em>Tit.</em> 11.



Dio is more accurate, recording that Titus was 39 years, five months and 25



days on his accession (24 June A.D. 79).</p>







<p><a name="2"></a>[[2]] Suet.<em> Tit.</em> 2, where it is also recorded that Titus was present at the

13.15-17; Dio 61.7.4; Jos.<em> AJ</em> 20.153; Eutropius 7.14.3; Herodian <em>Hist</em>. 4.5-6.</p>







<p><a name="3"></a>[[3]] The date of the military tribunate is difficult to establish, but Jones



argues sensibly for A.D. 61:<em> The Emperor Titus</em> (London, 1984), 14-16.</p>

<p><a name="5"></a>[[5]] The account of Titus' offspring is confusing.  Suet. <em>Tit</em>. 4.2 says that



Titus divorced Marcia "after she had borne a daughter."  Yet the girl is



not named, and Philostratus (<em>Vit. Apoll.</em> 7.7) contends that Titus had more



than one daughter.  It has also been argued that Arrecina Tertulla, Titus'



first wife, was Julia's mother.  See H. Castritius, "Zu den Frauen der



Flavier,"<em> Historia</em> 18 (1969): 492-502.  On the death of Julia: Suet. <em>Dom</em>. 22.</p>

<p><a name="7"></a>[[7]] Titus is cited by almost every ancient author who discusses him or the



city: Jos. <em>BJ</em> <em>passim</em>;<em> Hist</em> 5.1; Dio 66.7; Aurelius Victor D<em>e. Caes</em>. 11.11;



Orosius 7.9; Eutropius 7.21.  On the siege of the city itself, Josephus is

 On Berenice, a useful account appears at <em>Acts</em> 25, in which Paul meets the



two Jewish royals.  Josephus frequently mentions her wealth (<em>BJ</em> 2.426), her



men and arms (<em>BJ</em> 2.312), and her relationship with her brother Agrippa (<em>BJ</em>

<p><a name="11"></a>[[11]] The single piece of evidence concerns Aulus Caecina, an ex-consul,



whom Titus ordered stabbed at an imperial dinner on the suspicion of



treason.  See Suet. <em>Tit</em>. 6.</p>







<p><a name="12"></a>[[12]] On the praetorian prefecture, see notes 10, 11 above; on Berenice,



note 9 above; on Titus' sexual profligacy: Suet. <em>Tit</em>. 7.</p>







<p><a name="13"></a>[[13]] Flavian Amphitheater and public celebration: Dio 66.25; Suet. <em>Tit</em>.7;



baths: Suet. <em>Tit</em>. 7, but likely finished by Domitian, according to the



Chronographer of 354: <em>Chron. Min.</em> 1, p. 346; other references to



Amphitheater: Martial<em> Ep</em>. 3.20.15, 3.36.6; Arch of Titus:<em> CIL</em> 6.944 for the



dedicatory inscription, which reveals that the structure was dedicated



after Titus' death.  See also L. Richardson, Jr.<em>, A New Topographical



Dictionary of Ancient Rome </em>(Baltimore, 1992) s.v. "Arcus Titi," 30.</p>







<p><a name="14"></a>[[14]] Dio 66.19.3.</p>







<p><a name="15"></a>[[15]] Suet.<em> Tit</em>. 10.1.</p>







<p><a name="16"></a>[[16]] The ancient sources are quite inconsistent concerning Titus' death.



Suetonius records that Domitian ordered Titus to be left for dead when he



was ill, and Dio says that Domitian submerged his brother in packed snow



while he was still alive in order to hasten his end: Suet.<em> Dom</em>. 2.3; Dio



66.26.2-3.  Suetonius also reports an unidentified final regret by Titus



(<em>Tit.</em> 10.1), which Dio interpreted as his failure to eliminate his brother



(66.26.2-3).  Later writers consistently vilified Domitian as the poisoner



of Titus: Aurelius Victor,<em> De Caes</em>. 10.11; Philostratus,<em> De Apoll</em>. 6.32.



According to Plutarch, Titus died because he unwisely used the baths when



ill:<em> De Sanitate Tuenda</em> 3.</p>
