<div><p>Maria Porphyrogenita (also known as Maria Caesarissa, or 'Maria the
Caesar's wife') was the only surviving child of <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel
I Comnenus</a></b> and his first wife <b><a href="bertha.html">Bertha-Irene
of Sulzbach</a></b>. The wedding of her parents had taken place in January
1146,<b><a href="#N_1_">[[1]]</a></b> and she was probably born in March
1152. According to Cinnamus, she was hailed as 'empress', i.e. given the
title Augusta, at her birth.<b><a href="#N_2_">[[2]]</a></b> For the greater
part of her life, Maria was only a pawn in the manoeuvring of dynastic
politics, until she became involved in an insurrection against her step-mother's
regime during the brief reign of her brother <b><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius
II</a></b>.
</p></div><center>
<p><b>Maria and Béla of Hungary</b></p></center>

<p>Her mother, <b><a href="bertha.html">Bertha</a></b>, died in 1158, and
from the end of 1161 Maria had to share the palace with a new step-mother,
<b><a href="maryant.html">Maria
of Antioch</a></b>, who was probably not much older than herself. <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's</a></b>
new wife would naturally have taken precedence in court ceremonial. However,
until her brother <b><a href="alexii.html">Alexius II</a></b> was born on
14 September 1169,<b><a href="#N_3_">[[3]]</a></b> Maria was the heir presumptive
to the throne. At the age of eleven years she was betrothed by <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></b>
to Béla of Hungary, second son of Géza II (1141-1161), who
came to be educated in Constantinople in 1163 and was given the rank of
despot.<b><a href="#N_4_">[[4]]</a></b> Béla took the Byzantine
name of Alexius.
</p><p>Béla was a good match, even for an imperial princess. The Hungarians
had originally insisted, against <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's</a></b>
wishes, that Géza be succeeded by his elder son István (Stephen)
III (1161-1172), Béla's older brother. <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></b>
had expected Géza's brother, István IV, who was married to
<b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's</a></b>
niece Maria, to succeed him. It was the custom for the king of Hungary
to be succeeded by a younger brother, but in this particular case the Hungarians
were afraid of overt Byzantine influence.<b><a href="#N_5_">[[5]]</a></b>
<b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></b> finally agreed to the succession
of István III because of the realisation that Béla was István
III's natural successor. If Béla were married to his daughter, he
would therefore be the father-in-law of the heir presumptive of the kingdom
of Hungary.
</p><p><b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel </a></b>therefore concluded a pact
with the Hungarian king, István III, in the autumn of 1163. He would
support István's regime, while István's brother Béla
was to come to Constantinople and be betrothed to Maria Porphyrogenita.
Frangochorion (Fruska Gora) and Sirmium (the region between the Danube
and the Sava) were to be granted to the Byzantine emperor as Béla-Alexius'
appanage. Béla's credentials were examined by the <i>sebastos</i>
George Paleologus, who ascertained the state of affairs at the Hungarian
court and then escorted Béla to Constantinople. <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel
</a></b>was
keen to secure Byzantine rule of the border regions, but, more than that,
he clearly envisaged a future union of Hungary and Byzantium. Cinnamus
states that 'he desired with all his might to lay claim to Hungary, which
is situated in the midst of the western nations.<b><a href="#N_6_">[[6]]</a></b>
However<b> </b>István was not entirely happy with this arrangement.
He broke the treaty and there were continual outbreaks of war over Béla's
heritage between 1163 and 1167.<b><a href="#N_7_">[[7]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b>Maria as heir presumptive</b></p></center>

<p><b><a href="maryant.html">Maria of Antioch</a></b>, whom <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></b>
had married on 25 December 1161, was still childless, and so in 1165/66
<b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></b>
fixed the succession on Maria and her fiancé, should he die without
a male heir.<b><a href="#N_8_">[[8]]</a></b> His decision to pass the succession
to Maria and Béla in default of a son provoked criticism, as it
seemed designed to secure the throne to an Hungarian. <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's
</a></b>cousin Andronicus Comnenus took the oath to the couple only with
reluctance, with the comment, 'what madness is this of the emperor to deem
every Roman male unworthy of his daughter's nuptial bed, to choose before
all others this foreigner and interloper to be emperor of the Romans and
to sit above all as master?' In this he had the support of many, who saw
the decision as unwise both for Maria's sake and for the empire.<b><a href="#N_9_">[[9]]</a></b>
As well as receiving a suitable education at the Constantinopolitan court,
Béla was engaged in campaigns in Hungary in 1165-1167, perhaps with
a view to giving him suitable military experience for an emperor designate.
He was present at <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's </a></b>siege and
capture of Zeugminon in 1165, and involved in <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's</a></b>
campaigns against István III in Sirmium, his inheritance, in 1166.<b><a href="#N_10_">[[10]]</a></b>
Since not only was Béla's brother apparently childless, but it was
the law in Hungary that the crown passed to the survivors of brothers,<b><a href="#N_11_">[[11]]</a></b>
Maria might well have looked forward at this point to becoming both Empress
of Byzantium and Queen of Hungary.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><center>
<p><b>Maria's changing future</b></p></center>

<p>However, <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel </a></b>was still prepared
to consider other options for Maria: in 1166 or 1167 he undertook marriage
negotiations with a view to an alliance with the young Norman king of Sicily,
William II, whose father William I had died in May 1166 (William II had
been born in 1154, and so was not inappropriately young for Maria). William's
regents however finally declined the proposal and the engagement with Béla
continued in force. <b><a href="#N_12_">[[12]]</a></b>
<br>Maria's status changed drastically at the birth of <b><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius
II</a></b> on 14 September 1169. To have been presented with a young brother
and supplanter at the age of seventeen must have been a disappointment
(especially as <b><a href="maryant.html">Maria of Antioch</a></b> had previously
suffered at least one miscarriage). Maria's future was also affected in
other ways. Shortly afterwards, perhaps in March 1171 when the oaths of
allegiance were transferred from Maria and Béla to the young <b><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius
II</a></b>, Maria's engagement to Béla was broken off. Béla
was given the high rank of Caesar, perhaps as a consolation, and was betrothed
instead to <b><a href="maryant.html">Maria of Antioch's</a></b> half-sister
Anne of Chatillon, who was visiting Constantinople with her brother Baldwin
III of Antioch.
</p><p>Béla's future was, however, to be assured: in 1172, on the death
of his elder brother István III, he was invited by the Hungarians
to take over the throne of Hungary as Béla III (1172-1196). <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></b>
sent Béla and Anne to Hungary after Béla had taken an oath
to always act in the interests of the Byzantine empire. Béla was
accompanied by the <i>protosebastos</i> John Comnenus and a Byzantine army.<b><a href="#N_13_">[[13]]</a></b>
Maria was now neither heir-presumptive of Byzantium, nor Queen of Hungary,
an honour which was reserved for her step-mother's sister.&nbsp; As an
excuse to break off Maria's engagement with Béla, <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel
</a></b>may
have decided to invoke the law of consanguinity, forbidding the marriage
of close in-laws, i.e. those within the sixth degree of relationship.<b><a href="#N_14_">[[14]]</a></b>
Maria was the granddaughter of <b><a href="johncomn.htm#N_xx">Piroska</a></b>
of Hungary, daughter of László I (1077-1095), Béla's
first cousin three times removed. While this could hardly have been an
obstacle, Béla's uncle István IV (1162) had married Maria,
daughter of <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's</a></b> older brother Isaac.
Béla's uncle was therefore married to Maria Porphyrogenita's first
cousin (though this would not have been a problem had the marriage still
seemed politically eligible).
<br>&nbsp;
</p><center>
<p><b>Search for a husband</b></p></center>

<p><b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></b> now had to find a new husband
for Maria, who at twenty years of age was old for a Byzantine bride. <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></b>
still had no interest in the sons of Byzantine aristocratic families, instead
surveying eligible suitors abroad who were either unmarried rulers, or
the heirs to thrones. <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's</a></b> final
choice was once again William II of Sicily. Arrangements for the betrothal
were agreed in 1172, but Maria never left for the West.<b><a href="#N_15_">[[15]]</a></b>
Rather embarrassingly, William and his entourage waited for his promised
imperial bride at Taranto in southern Italy, only to find that they had
been jilted. The chief Norman source who reports the event expresses outrage
at this behaviour on the part of the Byzantine emperor.<b><a href="#N_16_">[[16]]</a><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></b>
had thought better of the match, and it is possible that Henry the Lion,
Duke of Bavaria, may have held out a proposal for a match between Maria
and the German imperial house.<b><a href="#N_17_">[[17]]</a></b> If this
suggestion is correct, the alternative marriage did not come to pass. We
are told by Nicetas Choniates that Maria continued to have many suitors.<b><a href="#N_18_">[[18]]</a></b>
Maria therefore had failed not only to become Queen of Hungary, but also
to marry William II of Sicily, and possibly John 'Lackland', later John
I of England, and Henry, the son of Frederick Barbarossa, into the bargain.<b><a href="#N_19_">[[19]]</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b>Renier of Montferrat</b></p></center>

<p><b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel </a></b>continued to temporise, now
he had an heir. Maria, however, was unlikely to have been as patient. Finally,
his mind was made up by the Peace of Venice of 1177 signed between Pope
Alexander III, the German emperor Frederick Barbarossa, William II of Sicily,
and the communes of Lombardy. This was effectively an anti-Byzantine coalition,
and <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></b> felt the need to secure allies
on the western flank of this bloc. To this end he concluded a marriage
pact with William 'the Old' of Montferrat (in north-western Italy), whereby
William's youngest son Renier was to marry Maria.<b><a href="#N_20_">[[20]]</a></b>&nbsp;
Coincidentally, two other sons of William, Conrad and Boniface, were to
also leave an indelible mark on the Byzantine empire.
<br>Everyone felt that it was high time that Maria settled down. Choniates'
describes her in terms which make her seem an unhappy victim of her father's
political manoeuvring:
</p><p>"The maiden, a princess wooed by many, was like Agamemnon's daughter
Electra, raving long in the palace and, stately as a white poplar wet with
dew, longing for the marriage bed. Later, after the emperor had given the
matter much thought, she became the consort of one of the sons of the Count
of Montferrat, who was fair of face and pleasant to look upon; his well-groomed
hair shone like the sun and he was too young to grow a beard, while she
had passed her thirtieth year and was as strong as a man."<b><a href="#N_21_">[[21]]</a></b>
</p><p>Choniates is here exaggerating a little regarding Maria's age, for she
cannot have been more than twenty-seven at Renier's arrival, but it is
clear that the match must have seemed a come-down. Instead of a splendid
alliance with a ruler or heir to the throne in western Europe, Maria had
to remain in the palace at Constantinople and make do with the younger
son of a marquis, who (born c. 1163) was at least 10 years her junior.
Renier, who was now given the name 'John', arrived in Constantinople in
the August or September or 1179. John was given the rank of Caesar (hence
Maria is often known as Maria Caesarissa to distinguish her from her step-mother)
and the couple are often jointly termed 'the Caesars' by historians: doubtless
Maria dominated her young, foreign, husband and they were seen as working
as a team.
</p><p>The marriage of Maria and Renier was celebrated at the same time as
that of prince <b><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius</a></b> with <b><a href="aggiefran.html">Agnes</a></b>,
daughter of Louis VII of France, on 2 March 1180. The double wedding was
celebrated by the patriarch, Theodosius Boradiotes. Eustathius of Thessalonica
composed an oration for the occasion describing how the wedding banquet
was spectacularly conducted in the Hippodrome,<b><a href="#N_22_">[[22]]</a></b>
and William of Tyre eulogised the lavish wedding celebrations.<b><a href="#N_23_">[[23]]</a></b>
It was a chance for the Byzantine court to impress the West with its grandeur
and sophistication. Once again Maria must have felt upstaged as it was
the alliance of <b><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius</a></b> and <b><a href="aggiefran.html">Agnes
</a></b>which was the more politically significant. Moreover the ceremonial
surrounding the reception of the new child bride must have thrown Maria's
own age into sharp relief.&nbsp; There is a possibility that even at this
point Maria Porphyrogenita may already have aligned herself against her
western step-mother and alongside the anti-Latins in the capital. After
all, with Maria Porphyrogenita remaining in the palace unmarried until
her late twenties, relations with her step-mother can not have been tranquil.
She had even had the frustration of seeing her step-mother's sister becoming
queen of Hungary in her stead. When in 1179, the young <b><a href="aggiefran.html">Agnes</a></b>,
daughter of Louis VII of France, arrived to marry <b><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius</a></b>,
this proved the crowing point of <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's</a></b>
pro-western policy, and a further demotion for Maria Porphyrogenita: the
new princess, bride of the heir to the throne, of course took precedence
over her sister-in-law. William of Tyre records that Agnes, who now took
the name Anna, was eight years of age on her arrival (she had actually
been born in 1172).<b><a href="#N_24_">[[24]]</a></b>
</p><p><b><a href="aqggiefran.html">Agnes'</a></b> ceremonial welcome by her
new sister-in-law Maria Porphyrogenita is depicted in the manuscript of
a poem no doubt intended to be delivered at court to celebrate this occasion.
The manuscript, with its lively illustrations, may have been commissioned
by<b><a href="maryant.html"> Maria of Antioch</a></b> for presentation to
the new child princess (At fol. 7r, <b><a href="maryant.html">Maria of Antioch</a></b>
is herself splendidly represented as a dominant figure in the proceedings).
Maria Porphyrogenita, the 'empress', is described as greeting her new sister-in-law
in a specially erected tent outside the walls of Constantinople after <b><a href="aggiefran.html">Agnes</a></b>
herself has been properly dressed as 'empress' for the occasion.<b><a href="#N_25_">[[25]]</a></b>
The poem tacitly emphasises the superiority of the western bride over her
sister-in-law, with Maria performing obeisance to <b><a href="aggiefran.html">Agnes</a></b>,
who is specifically called the more beautiful of the princesses: 'one of
these was the glory of the whole West, your own lively form of air and
crystal, while the other, the second, Augusta, unable to bear comparison
with your beauty, was your sister-in-law the porphyrogennete.'<b><a href="#N_26_">[[26]]</a></b>
<br>&nbsp;
</p><center>
<p><b>The regency</b></p></center>

<p>On the death of <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></b> on 24 September
1180, <b><a href="maryant.html">Maria of Antioch</a></b> became regent for
the young <b><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius II</a></b>, at the same time
taking the veil, as <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel </a></b>had insisted
she do on his death. Her regime was seen as pro-Latin and quickly became
unpopular, especially when the empress gave the reins of power to her husband's
nephew, Alexius the <i>protosebastos</i>, who was assumed to be her lover.
Maria Porphyrogenita, like the rest of the Comnenian family, was furious
at the assumption of power by the <i>protosebastos</i>, and enraged at
the thought of 'the protosebastos disporting himself in her father's marriage
bed'. She was also jealous of the dowager empress's power as regent for
the brother whose birth had denied her the chance of inheriting the throne.
'Reckless and masculine', she even wrote to Andronicus Comnenus inciting
him to rebel against her step-mother's regime.<b><a href="#N_27_">[[27]]</a></b>
</p><p>A conspiracy was formed, primarily of family members, around Maria and
Renier to assassinate the <i>protosebastos</i> on 7 February 1181, not
much more than four months after <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel's</a></b>
death. The regency was very unpopular. The occasion was the procession
of the emperor and <i>protosebastos</i> to celebrate the festival of Theodore
the Martyr of Christ, but the plot was thwarted. The conspirators were
arrested and summarily tried and convicted with the empress and <b><a href="alexii.html">Alexius
II</a></b> presiding, quite improperly as Choniates records.<b><a href="#N_28_">[[28]]</a>
</b>No action was taken against Maria and Renier, and they fled for protection
to St Sophia (before Easter, 5 April 1181), where not only the patriarch
Theodosius Boradiotes and the clergy took pity on them, but the populace
at large backed them enthusiastically. Confident in popular support, they
refused the offer of an amnesty.<b><a href="#N_29_">[[29]]</a></b>
</p><p>Maria represented herself as escaping from the anger of her step-mother
and her violent 'lover', and won the support of the anti-Latin party with
coin donatives. Her demands were that the protosebastos be expelled from
the palace and her fellow-conspirators undergo a new, fair, trial.<b><a href="#N_30_">[[30]]</a></b>
Choniates makes it quite clear that the populace, rather than revolting
spontaneously, was deliberately inflamed by Maria over several days. The
crowd was fired up by priests and anathematised the empress and<i> protosebastos</i>
in the hippodrome (these shouts could certainly have been heard in the
palace). Maria was able to raise enough troops to defend St Sophia, which
she fortified, enlisting Georgian and Italian mercenaries (Choniates considered
this scandalous).<b><a href="#N_31_">[[31]]</a></b> The populace now rose
in revolt, gathering at the turning-post of the Hippodrome (connected to
the Great Palace), and tearing down the houses of the rich and those supporting
the <i>protosebastos'</i> regency, including that of the eparch Theodore
Pantechnes. Further, the 'Caesars'<i> </i>(Maria and Renier) had the houses
adjoining the Great Church and the Augusteum (the main entrance to the
palace) demolished, and sentries placed in readiness for battle at the
Augusteum, as the <i>protosebastos</i> was gathering troops in support
of himself and the empress-regent.<b><a href="#N_32_">[[32]]</a></b> Skirmishing
may have taken place over a number of days, but Nicetas Choniates gives
a detailed account of the culmination of the conflict which began at dawn
on 2 May 1181, between the supporters of the <i>protosebastos </i>and those
of Maria Porphyrogenita.<b><a href="#N_33_">[[33]]</a></b> At midday, the
battle was evenly contested, with Maria's troops, although smaller in number,
being favoured by topographical considerations detailed in Choniates' account.
However, the weight of numbers of the <i>protosebastos</i>' troops prevailed
in the end, and eventually, after suffering heavy casualties, the insurrectionists
were driven back into St Sophia. Maria, supported by the patriarch, now
sought a truce, which was negotiated by the grand dux, Andronicus Contostephanus
and the grant hetaireiarch John Ducas Camaterus along with other officials
on 3 May. A full amnesty was granted Maria and her supporters and she and
Renier were allowed to return to the palace.<b><a href="#N_34_">[[34]]</a></b>
</p><p>The conflict won the name of the 'holy war' because the patriarch Theodosius
had supported the insurrection and allowed the 'Caesars' to take over St
Sophia as their base. The <i>protosebastos</i>, therefore, won over many
bishops to his side by gold and drinking parties, to encourage them to
support the patriarch's deposition. According to Eustathius the patriarch
was seized during a visit to the palace to exchange the Easter kiss of
peace with the emperor (Choniates provides a different version, in which
the patriarch was only arrested after the final battle). Certainly, the
patriarch was confined in the monastery of Christ Pantepoptes and the protosebastos
unsuccessfully tried to have him deposed. In the face of the empress' and
clergy's support for the holy man, the<i> protosebastos </i>had to back
down and reinstate him a month later to triumphal acclaim by the populace.
This aggression against the patriarch gave Maria Porphyrogenita the opportunity
of promoting her cause as a 'holy war' against the pro-Latin forces of
evil.<sup> </sup><b><a href="#N_35_">[[35]]</a></b> Clearly she was not
only an instigation of the assassination attempt on the protosebastos,
but an active aggressor in the insurrection in the capital. Following the
amnesty, Choniates actually criticises Maria for her evident thirst for
battle and terms the episode an 'inglorious war':
</p><p>'Nor do I absolve the suppliant kaisarissa (Caesarissa) from guilt,
inclined as she was towards reckless acts and agitation against the government'<b><a href="#N_36_">[[36]]</a></b>
</p><p>Clearly, she was aware of the inexcusable nature of her actions. The
stirring speech which Choniates records as delivered by Renier to his troops
on 2 May outside St Sophia clearly tries to make excuses for the armed
rebellion against 'compatriots and coreligionists'. Renier blames these
for mismanagement of the empire and sees his own side as compelled by necessity
to oppose them and as innocent of all crime. Ignoring the assassination
attempt on the <i>protosebastos</i>, he blames the other side for taking
up arms against them and for trying to drag asylum-seekers from sanctuary;
under these circumstances, he tells his troops, wife's servants and Latin
bodyguard, it is perfectly reasonable and right for them to defend themselves
and even to consider themselves as the defender of St Sophia and its treasures
against 'blood-thirsty murderers' in search of plunder from the holy church.<b><a href="#N_37_">[[37]]</a></b>
We need not take this as a literal account of proceedings, though Renier
doubtless made a speech. But whatever his facility in Greek at this point,
the sentiments and expressions must be those of Maria, even if it was Renier
who gave voice to them.

<p><b>Maria's death</b></p></center>

<p>Maria Porphyrogenita had encouraged <b><a href="andycomn.html">Andronicus
Comnenus</a></b> to seize power. His take-over was to be accompanied by
the murder of the Latins in the city and other atrocities.<b><a href="#N_38_">[[38]]</a></b>
Though Maria had been one of his chief supporters, ironically, as he started
his reign of terror in 1182,<b><a href="#N_39_">[[39]]</a></b> she was
one of his first victims. One of her family eunuchs, Pterygeonites, who
had even been a retainer of Manuel's, was bribed by Andronicus to slowly
poison her. The same fate shortly overtook Renier, and the 'same cup' was
said to have poisoned both of them.<b><a href="#N_40_">[[40]]</a></b> Thus
<b><a href="andycomn.html">Andronicus</a></b> was able to work his way towards
his murder of the empress-regent, <b><a href="maryant.html">Maria of Antioch</a></b>,
and that of the young emperor <b><a href="alexiicom.html">Alexius II.</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p></center>

<p>Maria Porphyrogenita had been one of the main opponents of her step-mother's
regency. Perhaps inheriting her uncompromising disposition from her mother
<b><a href="bertha.html">Bertha</a></b>, she was charged with 'masculine'
and reckless conduct by contemporaries. Embittered at having spent most
of her life ingloriously in the women's quarters and at being cheated of
a suitable marriage with a western ruler, she was clearly jealous of her
beautiful western step-mother in whose shadow she had lived since 1161.
She may have felt greatly inferior: Cinnamus conventionally calls her 'outstanding
in beauty' but there is no other evidence for her physical charms.<b><a href="#N_41_">[[41]]</a></b>
Her opposition to her step-mother's regency, and to the power given to
Alexius the protosebastos, is understandable, given the gossip about their
love-affair. Arguably,<b><a href="maryant.html"> Maria of Antioch</a></b>
was not a successful regent, and there was clearly dissatisfaction both
in the city and at court. But despite all Maria Porphyrogenita's aggression
towards the regime, there is no hint that she was aiming to depose her
younger brother or angling for the throne for herself and her husband.
Of course, she may well have felt herself a more suitable regent for her
brother than her step-mother and have been aiming at taking over the regency
herself. While her invitation to <b><a href="andycomn.html">Andronicus Comnenus</a></b>
to take action against the regime helped to provoke the crisis, it can
also be understood as an attempt to protect her brother's throne: <b><a href="andycomn.html">Andronicus</a></b>,
prior to his actual take-over, was seen by everyone as the natural protector
of the rights of Manuel's son.<b><a href="#N_42_">[[42]]</a></b> It is
significant, too, that in his move towards sole power, he saw Maria Porphyrogenita
as one of his main obstacles: presumably he knew that, however much her
future had been sacrificed to her father's foreign policy, she would uphold
her brother's right to rule.
