<h3>Pulcheria (Wife of the Emperor Marcian)</h3>

<h3>Geoffrey
Greatrex</h3>

<center>Dalhousie University</center>

<p>Aelia Pulcheria, born on 19 January 399, was the daughter of the Emperor
<b><a href="arcadius.html">Arcadius </a></b>and <b><a href="aeleudoxia.html">Aelia
Eudoxia</a></b>. She was the elder sister of the Emperor <b><a href="theo2.html">Theodosius
II </a></b>and of Arcadia and Marina. Her own elder sister, Flaccilla,
probably died before 408. Pulcheria exercised enormous influence on her
brother <b><a href="theo2.html">Theodosius</a></b> for considerable periods
of his reign. Numerous sources record her extensive involvement in his
education: according to Theophanes, already in 412, i.e. at the age of
thirteen, she dismissed the eunuch Antiochus from court, who had been <b><a href="theo2.html">Theodosius'</a></b>
tutor, and took over the role herself.<b><a href="#N_1_">[[1]]</a></b>
She quickly put her stamp on the imperial court, giving it an austere,
pious atmosphere. At the same time, she secured both her own position -
and, more importantly, her brother's - by vowing her virginity to God.
Pulcheria's decision to refuse to marry probably stemmed both from genuine
convictions, as evidenced by her life-long devotion to Mary, and from political
considerations: by rejecting marriage, she prevented any noble who was
aspiring to the throne from using her as a springboard to unseating her
brother. The downfall of the praetorian prefect Anthemius around this time
(414) may be connected with Pulcheria's decision, for it has been suggested
that he was exerting pressure on her to take a husband.<b><a href="#N_2_">[[2]]</a></b>
</p><p>On 4 July, 414, Pulcheria was made Augusta by <b><a href="theo2.html">Theodosius</a></b>.
Soon afterwards, coins were minted on which she appeared on the obverse,
crowned by the right hand of God - a development by no means without precedent,
although all previous Augustae had received the status as the result of
providing children to their husbands (the emperors).<b><a href="#N_3_">[[3]]</a></b>
Her influence over the government of the empire emerges clearly from a
number of sources.<b><a href="#N_4_">[[4]]</a></b>
An immediate effect was a hardening of imperial policy towards non-Christians,
and Jews in particular. Throughout her life, Pulcheria devoted her wealth
to the church; in 420, for instance, she sent money to Jerusalem for those
in need, inspiring <b><a href="theo2.html">Theodosius</a></b> to do likewise.
At the same time, at least according to the chronicler Theophanes, a golden
cross was erected in Jerusalem and the right arm of Saint Stephen despatched
from the holy city to Constantinople. Some scholars have suggested that
the Trier Ivory depicts its arrival in Constantinople, and that the short
woman standing holding a cross is Pulcheria herself; under this interpretation,
the cross represents her godly resolve (to maintain her virginity).<b><a href="#N_5_">[[5]]</a></b>
Whether or not this identification is accepted, there is undoubtedly a
link between these developments and the war which broke out between Rome
and Persia in 420 and which continued until 422. Saint Stephen could be
supposed to be more likely to intervene on behalf of the Roman forces,
now that such an important relic had been transferred to the capital and
more closely associated with the emperor. A series of gold <i>solidi</i>
commemorating the erection of the cross at Jerusalem was minted; on the
reverse of some of these issues, the emperor himself is depicted; on others,
his brother Honorius; and on others still, Pulcheria - the first time that
an Augusta had thus been placed on a par with the reigning emperors.<b><a href="#N_6_">[[6]]</a></b>
As it turned out, the war ended in 422 with a treaty which allowed both
sides to claim victory; <b><a href="theo2.html">Theodosius'</a></b> piety
- inspired by Pulcheria - was believed to be responsible for the success
of his armies in the field.<b><a href="#N_7_">[[7]]</a></b>
</p><p>Inevitably, the marriage of <b><a href="theo2.html">Theodosius </a></b>to
<b><a href="eudocia.html">Eudocia</a></b> in 421 (formerly known as Athenaïs),
was followed by a waning of the influence Pulcheria. She withdrew from
the imperial palace and took up residence at various other palaces in or
around the capital, e.g. at the Hebdomon and at Rufinianae. The Augusta
was a wealthy woman, and such was the extent of her properties in one quarter
of the capital that it came to be called Pulcherianae.<b><a href="#N_8_">[[8]]</a></b>
She maintained strong contacts with Christians of all kinds, both those
on the margins of the church hierarchy, such as Saint Hypatius, a holy
man living in the vicinity of Constantinople, and the Akoimetae - the Sleepless
Monks - who met with considerable hostility when they appeared first in
Constantinople in the 420s, as well as with Proclus, the patriarch of Constantinople.<b><a href="#N_9_">[[9]]</a></b>
She continued to be a lavish patron of the church, erecting several churches
in Constantinople and playing a key role in the discovery of the relics
of the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste.<b><a href="#N_10_">[[10]]</a></b>
</p><p>The importance of Pulcheria emerges very clearly from the Nestorian
controversy. Nestorius, who became patriarch of Constantinople in 428,
clashed with the Augusta almost immediately, refusing to admit her to the
sanctuary of the Great Church in Constantinople only days after his enthronement.
Scholars have not unreasonably perceived a link between Nestorius' christological
position, downgrading the status of the Virgin Mary from Theotokos (Mother
of God) to Christotokos (Mother of Christ), and his hostility towards Pulcheria.
Equally, her fierce defence of the Virgin Mary was certainly connected
with her own vow of virginity and the status this conferred upon her.<b><a href="#N_11_">[[11]]</a></b>
The story of Nestorius' downfall and the Council of Ephesus in 431 has
been told many times and need not be related here. It is sufficient to
note that the Patriarch Cyril of Alexandria, who emerged the victor after
the Council, believed that Pulcheria was instrumental in bringing about
the fall of his rival; it is also worthy of note that <b><a href="theo2.html">Theodosius</a></b>,
who had initially given his backing to Nestorius, ended up having to give
way to his sister.<b><a href="#N_12_">[[12]]</a></b>
</p><p>Pulcheria's position appears to have remained strong for much of the
430s. By 438 the rift between the emperor and his wife <b><a href="eudocia.html">Eudocia</a></b>
had become evident; in that year she obtained leave from him to pay a visit
to Jerusalem and the holy sites.<b><a href="#N_13_">[[13]]</a></b>
However, the rise to prominence of the eunuch Chrysaphius, the <i>spatharius</i>
of <b><a href="theo2.html">Theodosius</a></b>, brought with it a decline
in Pulcheria's influence. She was forced again to withdraw to the Hebdomon
palace, this time to avoid being consecrated as a deaconess.<b><a href="#N_14_">[[14]]</a></b>
Her final resurgence came when a new christological debate was sparked.
Again, her brother <b><a href="theo2.html">Theodosius</a></b> was on the
opposite side, according his support to the archimandrite Eutyches, who
took the view that Christ was entirely God - what is known as the 'Monophysite
view', i.e. that Christ had one nature, and that this nature was divine.
Eutyches enjoyed the vigorous backing of Dioscorus, Cyril's successor as
patriarch of Alexandria. A council was held in Ephesus in 449 (later known
as the 'Robber Council' [<i>latrocinium</i>] because of various irregularities
in procedure) from which this party emerged triumphant. In the wake of
this victory for Dioscorus and Eutyches, Pope Leo sought the aid of Pulcheria
(among others) to reverse the council's decisions.<b><a href="#N_15_">[[15]]</a></b>
</p><p>The situation changed abruptly on 26 July 450 with the unexpected death
of <b><a href="theo2.html">Theodosius</a></b>. Within a month, however,
a somewhat obscure former tribune and <i>domesticus</i> named <b><a href="marcian.html">Marcian</a></b>
had been acclaimed emperor and had married Pulcheria. The circumstances
surrounding the elevation of <b><a href="marcian.html">Marcian</a></b>,
who was shortly to preside over the Council of Chalcedon (see below), were
a source of much debate and polemic, both at the time and for long afterwards.
Those opposed to the outcome of the Council insisted upon the illegitimacy
of <b><a href="marcian.html">Marcian's</a></b> accession, which was not
acknowledged in the west until 452; they were also fiercely critical of
Pulcheria, portraying her as enamoured of <b><a href="marcian.html">Marcian</a></b>
and engineering his accession to satisfy her lusts. Supporters of Chalcedon,
on the other hand, affirmed that <b><a href="marcian.html">Marcian</a></b>
agreed to respect the empress' virginity and sought to give the emperor's
accession as much legitimacy as they could. To what extent Pulcheria actually
made the choice of <b><a href="marcian.html">Marcian</a></b> is open to
doubt: one scholar sees behind his elevation the machinations of the powerful
general Aspar, with whom <b><a href="marcian.html">Marcian</a></b> was certainly
connected. At any rate, there are no grounds for supposing that Pulcheria
actually crowned <b><a href="marcian.html">Marcian</a></b> herself; rather,
he was probably acclaimed by the assembled soldiers in the Campus Martius,
outside the city, and raised aloft on a shield.<b><a href="#N_16_">[[16]]</a></b>
Coins issued depict the imperial couple with Christ himself sponsoring
their marriage - perhaps an attempt to deflect criticism of Pulcheria,
whose vow of virginity was called into question by her marriage.<b><a href="#N_17_">[[17]]</a></b>
Pulcheria lost no time in restoring the balance of church politics in favour
of her line. At the Council of Chalcedon, held in 451, a more moderate
christological position was proclaimed, which held that Christ was 'in
two natures', rather than being entirely God (or entirely man). The assembled
bishops eagerly offered up acclamations to the empress, on some occasions
placing her before <b><a href="marcian.html">Marcian</a></b>. As he was
declared a 'New Constantine', so she was hailed as a 'New Helena' (the
mother of <b><a href="conniei.html">Constantine</a></b>).<b><a href="#N_18_">[[18]]</a></b>
</p><p>Pulcheria died in 453, bequeathing her worldly goods to charity. She
is regarded as a saint in both eastern and western churches.<b><a href="#N_19_">[[19]]</a></b>
Butler's <i>Lives of the Saints</i> concludes its remarkably glowing assessment
of Pulcheria thus: 'If we consider her actions and virtues we shall see
that the commendations which St Proclus, in his panegyric on her, Pope
St Leo, and the Council of Chalcedon, bestowed on this empress, so far
from being compliments or mere eloquence, thoroughly well deserved. St
Pulcheria is named on this day [10 September] in the Roman Martyrology
having been inserted by Cardinal Baronius, a happier and more worthy addition
than some we owe to that venerable and learned scholar; her feast is kept
by the Greeks, and at one time she had a certain <i>cultus</i> in the West,
her feast being observed, e.g. throughout Portugal and the kingdom of Naples.'<b><a href="#N_20_">[[20]]</a></b>

Blockley dates this fragment to 404 and suspects that the reference to

On the council and its origins, see Fraisse-Coué 1998, 9-65, Allen
2000, 813-14. On the roles of Chrysaphius and Pulcheria see Goubert 1951,
312-15. The eunuch fell from power before Theodosius' death, it is worth
noting, see e.g. Holum 1982, 207.
</p><p><a name="N_16_"></a>[[16]]This account follows Burgess 1993/4, who rightly
rejects the version of Holum 1982, 208, who has Pulcheria crowning Marcian.
He offers a detailed consideration of all the traditions surrounding Marcian's
accession (and Pulcheria's role in it). Whitby 2000, 60 n.12 (commenting
on Evagrius, <i>HE</i> II.1), is sceptical about Aspar's role. Cf. McCormick
2000, 146-7, who is inclined to take seriously the power of empresses in
this period.
</p><p><a name="N_17_"></a>[[17]]Holum 1982, 208-9.
</p><p><a name="N_18_"></a>[[18]]On the council, see (e.g.) Fraisse-Coué
1998, 65-77, Maraval 1998, 79-106 and Allen 2000, 814, and the brief account
in Treadgold 1997, 97-9. On Pulcheria's role and correspondence with Leo
(including one letter of her's which has survived), see Holum 1982, 211-16
and Frend 1972, 45-50 (esp. 50). Goubert 1951, 321, sees in Pulcheria a
'Joan of Arc' in her strong support of the papacy.
</p><p><a name="N_19_"></a>[[19]]See Holum, 227,
</p><p><a name="N_20_"></a>[[20]]Thurston and Attwater 1956, 530-1. On patriarch
Proclus' praise for Pulcheria see Holum 1982, 137-8. Butler curiously associates
Pulcheria with the establishment of the university there in the 420s, a
development more often associated with Eudocia.
