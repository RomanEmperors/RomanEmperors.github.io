<h3>
<b>John II Comnenus (A.D. 1118-1143</b></h3></center>

<center><b>Andrew Stone</b>
<br>University of Western Australia<b></b>
<p><b>Introduction: sources</b></p></center>

<p>The reign of John II Comnenus (15 August 1118 - 8 April 1143) represents
a phase of consolidation of the conquests of his father <b><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></b>,
coupled with the reconquest of territories previously lost. Some would
consider that his reign marks the furthest extent of the so-called Comnenian
restoration. Unfortunately, we have only a précis of the events
of the reign from the prose historians John Cinnamus and Nicetas Choniates,
who do not record everything of interest. Therefore the history of William
of Tyre, the Crusader kingdom's historian, and the panegyrical oeuvre of
the poet Theodore Prodromus make useful adjuncts. There are also two prose
encomia, by Nicephorus Basilaces and Michael Italicus. These Byzantine
panegyrical sources bear witness to the optimistic expectation which existed
during John's reign that the empire which had been bequeathed by<b><a href="basilii.html">
Basil II</a></b>, or even the original Roman empire, would be restored.
The popularity of the theme of <i>renovatio</i> in these panegyrics shows
the importance to the Byzantine psyche of the idea of empire at the time,
which was highlighted by John's endeavours. Modern historians have, however,
often questioned the effectiveness of John's constant and arduous campaigning,
given the impermanence of its results<b><a href="#N_1_">[[1]]</a></b><span face="Courier New">.</span>
</p><center>
<p><b>The succession</b></p></center>

<p>Nicetas Choniates alone tells of the actions by which John II secured
his own succession. <b><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius I</a></b> had favoured
John to succeed him over his wife Irene's favourite, Nicephorus Bryennius,
who was married to their daughter Anna. <b><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></b>
resorted to dissimulation in order to avert Irene's criticism of his choice
and her demands that Nicephorus should succeed. As <b><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></b>
lay on his deathbed in the monastery of the Mangana (15th August 1118),
John, consorting with relatives whom he could trust, among whom was his
brother, the <i>sebastokrator</i> Isaac, stole into the monastery and removed
the imperial signet ring from his dying father. Then, taking up arms, he
rode to the Great Palace, gathering the support of the citizenry, who acclaimed
him emperor. Irene was taken by surprise, and was unable either to persuade
her son to desist, or to induce Nicephorus to act against him. Although
the palace guard at first refused to admit John without proof of his father's
wishes, the mob surrounding the new emperor simply forced entry. <b><a href="alexcon.html">Alexius</a></b>
died the following night. John refused to join the funeral procession,
in spite of his mother's urging, because his hold on power was so tenuous.
However, in the space of a few days, his position was secure.
</p><center>
<p><b>John and the "Comnenian system"</b></p></center>

<p>It was John's policy to reward his relatives and supporters with appointments
to offices. His brother Isaac was received at the imperial throne and table
almost as an equal. His cousin John Comnenus was made
<i>parakoimomenos</i>
(but soon removed from office) and Gregory Taronites <i>protovestiarios</i>
(Chamberlain). Gregory Camaterus eventually reached the office of logothete
of the <i>sekreta</i>. The highest honours, however, were reserved for
a man of Turkish extraction, John Axuch, who had been John's friend since
childhood. He became grand domestic, commander of the armies. It can be
appreciated that this policy of granting office to relatives and friends
was effectively an extension of the policy of nepotism pursued by <b><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></b>,
itself an extension of the dynastic manoeuvring among the military aristocracy
carried out by <b><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius'</a></b> mother Anna Dalassena.
However, John was unable to satisfy all of his family, and often preferred
to grant offices to men who were unrelated but had served his father. This
created antagonism, which would lead to intrigue even within John's nuclear
family.
</p><center>
<p><b>Intrigue by Anna</b></p></center>

<p>Choniates tells of an early plot instigated by Anna Comnena to remove
her brother from the throne, which took place before the first year of
his reign had ended<b><a href="#N_2_">[[2]]</a></b>. He was to be attacked
while camping at Philopatium, outside the walls of the capital. However,
her husband Nicephorus was too half-hearted in his support for the plot
to succeed. John was lenient towards the conspirators, merely intending
to confiscate their possessions. If Choniates is to be believed, Axuch
interceded for Anna, with whom John became reconciled.
</p><center>
<p><b>Early campaigns in Phrygia</b></p></center>

<p>In 1119 John set out for Phrygia and was able to recapture Laodiceia
(near the Lycus River) from the Turks under the command of Alp-qara. Returning
briefly to Byzantium, he set out again to Phrygia the following year and
captured the city of Sozopolis, on precipitous terrain, by a cunning ruse.
The commander of the cavalry made an assault on the walls, and allowed
the Turks to chase them, whereupon they fell into an ambush. In the meantime
the gates were assaulted and the Turkish defenders were thus caught in
a pincer movement. John further took a fortress called Hierakokoryphitis,
and, we are told, others in the vicinity.
</p><center>
<p><b>The European theatre 1122-1129</b></p></center>

<p>In the winter of 1121-1122 the Petchenegs (or so we are told by the
historians: they may have been Cumans, another Turkic people) crossed the
river Danube and began laying waste to Thrace. John marched out to meet
them, managing to detach some of the chieftains from the main body through
gifts. The remainder were routed in a decisive battle, leaving many dead
and many captives. Both Choniates and Cinnamus mention the Petcheneg tactic
of defending their dependents with a circle of wagons, against which the
Varangian guard with their axes were sent. The anniversary of the victory
became a holiday. The following year (according to Choniates<b><a href="#N_3_">[[3]]</a></b>)
saw John make a punitive raid into Serbia. Cinnamus and Choniates seem
to have accepted the rhetoric of an "unworthy and craven foe" to describe
this perennial thorn in the side of the Byzantines.
</p><p>John had refused to renew the treaty that his father <b><a href="alexcomn.html">Alexius</a></b>
had made with the Venetians, no doubt in part due to the fact that Sicily
was no longer perceived as a threat. Accordingly, in 1124 the Venetians
ravaged Rhodes and Chios on the way home from the Crusader states, and
in 1126 Cephalonia. The Byzantines burnt the Venetian quarter in Constantinople,
but John realised that he must become reconciled with the Venetians and
ratified the Venetian privileges that his father had granted (August 1126).
</p><p>John had married a Hungarian princess,&nbsp;<a name="N_xx"></a>Piroska,
who took the name Irene and was responsible for the Pantokrator monastery
in Constantinople). Accordingly, on the death of King László
I of Hungary, László's elder son Stephen II succeeded to
the throne, and the younger, Álmos, sought refuge at the Byzantine
court. We told by both Choniates and Cinnamus that in the consequent Hungarian
crossing of the Danube and invasion of Byzantine territory (1127-1128)
the city of Branitshevo was taken and plundered<b><a href="#N_4_">[[4]]</a></b>.
Cinnamus mentions the looting of Belgrade in connection with this (first)
invasion<b><a href="#N_5_">[[5]]</a></b>. Both historians say that stone
spoils were used by the Hungarians to build Zeugminon (on the left bank
of the Sava, opposite Belgrade); Choniates says that these came from Branitshevo<b><a href="#N_6_">[[6]]</a></b>,
Cinnamus, however, perhaps more reasonably, that they were from Belgrade<b><a href="#N_7_">[[7]]</a></b>.
Choniates tells how John marched out to meet the enemy (spring 1128), with
naval support sailing up the Danube<b><a href="#N_8_">[[8]]</a></b>. Cinnamus
mentions the ploy by which John was able to effect a crossing of the Danube
by a part of his army upstream of Chramon, and then himself cross at Chramon<b><a href="#N_9_">[[9]]</a></b>,
from which he took much booty (Choniates<b><a href="#N_10_">[[10]]</a></b>).
Branitshevo's defences were strengthened, and Cinnamus associates the Hungarian
attack on it with John's return to Byzantium. Marching back out to Branitshevo
(so Cinnamus<b><a href="#N_11_">[[11]]</a></b>), John rebuilt the city,
and, although his army was afflicted with disease, it avoided excessive
casualties, despite the treacherous terrain, on the march home.
</p><p>Now that he had dealt with his enemies in the west, John was able to
concentrate on the business of the reconquest of Anatolia.
</p><center>
<p><b>Failure of the Comnenian system</b></p></center>

<p>In 1130 John and his brother Isaac had become estranged, and Isaac was
forced to flee Byzantium, ultimately seeking refuge at the court of the
Malik (king) Gümüshtigin Ghazi ibn Danishmend at Melitene, near
the Euphrates river. This ruler was, as the overlord of the ascendant Turkic
power in Anatolia, the most serious obstacle to John's ambitions in the
Anatolian peninsula. There are vague reports that Isaac was plotting for
the throne. This conflict within the top tier of the military aristocracy
that the Comnenian family represented would continue into the reign of
<b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel
I.</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b>Campaigns against the Danishmendids 1130-1135</b></p></center>

<p>In 1130 or 1132 John marched out with his army against Castamon in Paphlagonia,
the ancestral home of the Comneni; it had fallen into the hands of the
Danishmendid Turks. Capturing it and a great many captives, he returned
to Constantinople and held a triumph. Pride of place went to a silver chariot,
partly covered with gold and semi-precious stones. John went ahead of it,
yielding his place in the chariot to an icon of the Mother of God.
</p><p>In the meantime Gümüshtigin had besieged and recaptured Castamon.
John was delayed from marching immediately to its rescue due to the death
of his wife (Cinnamus<b><a href="#N_12_">[[12]]</a></b>). When he did take
to the field, he discovered that a Muhammad had succeeded Gümüshtigin,
and that Masud of the sultanate of Konya was his enemy. John therefore
made an alliance with Masud (late 1134). When the combined armies marched
on Castamon, however, Muhammad was able to convince Masud that John was
their common enemy, and, accordingly the Turkish contingent marching on
Castamon deserted during the night. John withdrew and wintered at a fortress
built on the Rhyndacus river (Lopadium). When he took to the field again
in 1135 he was successful in capturing both Castamon and Gangra, the latter
after a siege. Garrisoning Gangra with 2000 men, John returned to Byzantium.
Gangra, however, was soon recaptured by the Danishmendids.
</p><center>
<p><b>Armenian Cilicia and Coele Syria 1136-1139</b></p></center>

<p>The Armenian prince Leon, of the Rupenid family, after taking many Cilician
towns, was attempting to besiege Seleuceia (1136-1137). In response, John
marched into Cilicia, with an expedition of a scale that would suggest
that subjugation of it and neighbouring Coele Syria was more important
to him than his conquests in Asia Minor. Accordingly a great part of Cilicia
("the entire country": Choniates<b><a href="#N_13_">[[13]]</a></b>) was
subjugated, including Mopsuestia, Adana and Tarsus. Choniates is our main
source for this, spending much space on anecdotal material connected with
the siege of the town of Baka. He also devotes much space to the key capitulation
of Anazarba.
</p><p>In the meantime Bohemond (II) of the Crusader principality of Antioch
had been negotiating with John a marriage between John's youngest son Manuel
and his daughter Constance. By this means John hoped to attach Coele Syria
to the empire, possibly in the form of a client kingdom, since <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel
</a></b>had
three elder brothers alive at this point in time. However, the project
fell through, Constance marrying instead Raymond of Poitiers, who was to
be a thorn in the side of <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></b>.
</p><p>John laid siege to Antioch, and it soon surrendered, John agreeing to
the proposal that Raymond should remain in control of Antioch as the emperor's
liegeman, until such time as Aleppo capitulated to their combined armies.
This was effectively a reimposition of the terms of the Treaty of Devol
(see<a href="alexcomn.html"> <b>Alexius I</b></a>). At first (spring 1138)
the combined forces took Buza'ah, then advanced on Aleppo. Since there
was an insufficient water supply for a protracted siege, John moved on
from there with the armies to Shaizar on the Orontes. The lower town was
taken, but with the news of the approach of the fearsome Turkish <i>atabeg</i>
Zengi and his forces the siege was lifted after an indemnity had been exacted.
The armies, joined by that of Joscelin Count of Edessa, returned to Antioch,
and John made a solemn entry, with the two Crusader princes acting as his
grooms. The emperor installed himself in the palace, but there was a popular
uprising, and John found himself besieged there. Diplomatically accepting
Raymond's and Joscelin's insistence that they had nothing to do with the
rebellion, John decided to return home (spring 1139), accompanied by his
repentant brother Isaac, for the three-years' absence from home of his
troops had made them restive. However, the ritual obeisance that the Crusader
princes had made set a precedent which would be followed by <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel.</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b>Late campaigns in Anatolia 1139-41</b></p></center>

<p>John's sojourn in Byzantium was brief, for, despite illness, he needed
to go to the rescue of Lopadium in Mysia (spring 1139), and the regions
of the Sangarius river. He also built a fortress named Achyraous. He then
proposed to march on Muhammad the Danishmendid's stronghold of Caesareia
and Constantine Gabras, who held Trebizond, marching along the Pamphylian
coast so as only to have one flank exposed to the enemy. He campaigned
throughout the summer, cowing Gabras into submission, and wintered at Kinte
in the Pontus. There was a bitter winter in Cappadocia, the theatre of
war for the next campaigning season. After an initial reverse, trusting
in his Latin knights, he turned the Danishmendids to flight and he was
able to advance to Neocaesareia. This city was the site of many battles,
and Cinnamus tells us that booty was taken from the environs<b><a href="#N_14_">[[14]]</a></b>.
It was here that John's son <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel </a></b>displayed
his courageous, if impulsive and reckless, nature, when he charged a knot
of the enemy, for which he was castigated by his father. The battles around
Neocaesareia also witnessed the defection of John's nephew of the same
name, son of the
<i>sebastokrator </i>Isaac the senior (i.e. John's brother,
about whom we have talked above). The emperor was forced to retreat due
to a lack of horses and provisions (summer 1140). Spending only a short
time in the capital, he set out for Lopadium again in spring 1141, but
was chased out of these regions by an inclement winter.
</p><center>
<p><b>Final campaigns in Phrygia and Syria 1142-1143</b></p></center>

<p>In 1142 John marched to Attaleia on the southern coast of the Anatolian
peninsula. From here he decided to make an attack on the inhabitants of
the islands of Lake Pousgouse, who had friendly relations with the Turks
and regarded the Byzantines as the enemy. His stratagem of using fishing
boats to attack the islands was successful, although Byzantine casualties
were heavy.
</p><p>Shortly afterwards his eldest two sons, Alexius and Andronicus, died,
and it was with <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></b> alone (for the
third son, Isaac, accompanied the bodies of his two elder brothers back
to Constantinople) that John marched on Syria to enforce Byzantine suzerainty
over the principality of Antioch for once and for all. On the way, he demanded
hostages from Joscelin of Courtenay. He also sent missives ahead of him
to Antioch announcing his intentions. However, the Crusaders withdrew to
the citadel, and John decided to return to Cilicia to winter, permitting
his soldiers to pillage the suburbs. From Cilicia, John announced his intentions
to King Fulk of Jerusalem to drive out the infidel and visit the Holy Places.
</p><p>It was in Cilicia that John was accidentally infected by a poisoned
arrow (though there are those that theorize that this was no accident),
and when it was apparent that he was going to die, the emperor chose his
youngest son <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></b> to be his successor
over the other remaining son Isaac, citing two main reasons, namely Isaac's
irascibility and the courage that <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></b>
had shown at Neocaesareia. Upon learning of John's wishes, the army acclaimed
<b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel
</a></b>emperor.
A few days later (8 April 1143) John died.
</p><center>
<p><b>The western theatre 1130-1142</b></p></center>

<p>Choniates and Cinnamus overlook the diplomatic overtures made by John
to the west. With the rise of Roger II Guiscard of Sicily, who took much
of southern Italy, John had supported the campaign of the German emperor
Lothair II of Supplinburg.&nbsp;&nbsp; This campaign descended into Italy
as far as Bari. With King Conrad III, Lothair's successor, John negotiated
a marriage alliance: Conrad's sister-in-law Bertha of Sulzbach was to marry
Manuel. Bertha was in Constantinople when John died. We have seen how John
was more interested in the eastern than western theatre of operations,
and it is a reasonable hypothesis that this alliance with the German emperor
was designed to keep Roger occupied while John marched east.
</p><center>
<p><b>Character and legacy</b></p></center>

<p>Choniates claims that John was the best emperor of the Comnenian dynasty.
A skilled strategist, if a demanding and fastidious taskmaster, and conventionally
pious without feeling a need to meddle in ecclesiastical affairs, John
did not call for the execution or maiming of a single subject during his
reign (so Choniates<b><a href="#N_15_">[[15]]</a></b>). He was responsible
for distribution of gold coins to the populace of the capital, and the
foundation of several ecclesiastical institutions in concert with his wife
Irene. It can be appreciated that the overriding concern for John was an
accomplishment of imperial <i>renovatio</i>, reconquest of land formerly
Byzantine (particularly central Anatolia and Armenia as far as the Euphrates),
a theme that occurs constantly in the panegyrics and encomiastic poems
of his reign. So he concentrated on the reconquest of the east, territory
which had been the Byzantine heartland under such emperors as <a href="basilii.html"><b>Basil
II</b> </a>of the "Macedonian" dynasty. John left the imperial treasury
full as his legacy to his vigorous son <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></b>.
It is easy in hindsight to say how unrealistic John's imperial agenda was.
However, the theme of <i>renovatio</i> was such that it was impressed upon
the young <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></b>, who, on the face of
it, would seem to have had even greater imperial pretensions. In any case,
reconquest of Asia Minor and Coele Syria was facilitated by the fact that
the Turks were still divided among themselves. This situation allowed the
existence of the Crusader States, a phenomenon with which <b><a href="mannycom.html">Manuel</a></b>
would come to terms better than his father. The optimistic tone of the
literature of the day may be one of the factors which has left us with
such a favourable impression of John, the second of the three great Comneni.
