<h3>
Constantine V Copronymus(741-775)</h3></center>

<center><b>Shaun Tougher</b>
<br>Cardiff University
<p><b>Introduction</b></p></center>

<p>Constantine V is one of the most notorious Byzantine emperors, but also
one of the most intriguing. His notoriety stems from the fact that he was
an Iconoclast and thus received hostile treatment in Iconophile sources
composed after his death, such as the <i>Chronicle</i> of Theophanes, the
<i>Life
of Stephen the Younger</i>, and the <i>Antirrhetici</i> of the patriarch
Nikephoros. From texts such as these he emerges as an archetypal wicked
tyrant, branded with derogatory nicknames, and renowned especially for
his brutal treatment of monks. Despite these biased sources it is clear
that there was far more to Constantine:&nbsp; he reigned for a long period
of time, achieved notable successes against the Arabs and the Bulgars,
and could be thought to have presided over a Golden Age. Ironically Nikephoros's
own <i>Brief History </i>conveys this more positive take on the emperor,
even recording the view that Constantine was a 'new Midas'<b>.<a href="#N_!">(1)&nbsp;</a></b>
Undoubtedly the emperor is someone we would like to know much more about,
but we are constrained by the limited and problematic evidence. The conflicting
impressions of the emperor can leave us with a complex image of the man:
he can be seen as 'highly strung' but also as an individual endowed with
'personal magnetism'<b>.<a href="#N_2_">(2)</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b><span size="-1">Early life</span></b></p></center>

<p>From his birth Constantine V was accustomed to imperial privilege. He
was born in 718 to the emperor <b><a href="leoiii.html">Leo III</a></b>
(717-741) and his wife <b><a href="mariaiii.html">Maria</a></b>, and christened
on Christmas Day of the same year in Hagia Sophia.<span size="-1"> </span>On
this occasion Constantine reputedly defecated in the font, which was taken
as a sign of his future evil by the patriarch Germanus<b>.<a href="#N_3_">(3)</a></b>Whether
Constantine did befoul the font is a moot point. It is possible that he
did and that Germanus' prophecy was added with hindsight, or the whole
story may be invention<b>.<a href="#N_4_">(4)</a> </b>What seems more sure
is that Leo III used the occasion of the baptism to enhance the position
of the dynasty; Theophanes records also that <b><a href="mariaiii.html">Maria</a></b>
was crowned Augusta, Constantine was attached to elite sponsors and that
largesse was distributed as mother and baby returned to the palace. Within
a couple of years <b><a href="leoiii.html">Leo</a></b> further consolidated
the position of his son, crowning him emperor on Easter Day 720<b>.<a href="#N_5_">(5)</a></b>We
do not hear of Constantine again for over ten years, the occasion being
his betrothal in 732 to the Khazar Chagan's daughter, who became a Christian
and was renamed Irene (in 750 she provided Constantine with his son and
heir <b><a href="leo4.html">Leo IV</a></b>, who was thus half-Khazar). Beyond
this political marriage <b><a href="leoiii.html">Leo</a></b> raised Constantine's
profile in other ways: he involved him in his military campaigns (Constantine
was present at the battle of Akroinos in 740: Theophanes <i>AM</i> 6231)
and in his legal work (Constantine features in the title of the <i>Ecloga</i>,
which has been dated to 741: Burgmann 1983). It is also likely that Constantine's
equestrian passion developed in his youth.
</p><center>
<p><b><span size="-1">Accession and Civil War</span></b></p></center>

<p>When <b><a href="leoiii.html">Leo III</a></b> died on 18 June 741 it
was clear that Constantine was his intended heir. Despite this he was soon
fighting for his right to rule as his brother-in-law <b><a href="anna.html">Artabasdus</a></b>,
the commander of the Opsikion theme, seized power. Theophanes presents
<b><a href="anna.html">Artabasdus</a></b>
as the innocent party, and plays up the factor of icons, but both aspects
of his account can be questioned. It seems more likely that this was a
deliberate coup launched by a strong candidate (as Nikephoros 64 relates);
<b><a href="anna.html">Artabasdus</a></b> had a distinguished career, military
backing, and imperial credentials through his wife <b><a href="anna.html">Anna
</a></b>(the daughter of <b><a href="leoiii.html">Leo III</a></b> and the
sister of Constantine V), by whom he already had two sons, Niketas and
Nikephoros. <b><a href="anna.html">Artabasdus'</a></b> usurpation (which
lasted for over two years) was strengthened by his grip on Constantinople
and his recognition by the patriarch Anastasios; Constantine had to seek
refuge in Amorion, though he secured the support of the Anatolikon and
Thrakesion armies, the latter being commanded by Sisinnios, his cousin
(Theophanes
<i>AM</i> 6235). In a series of campaigns Constantine came
off better, and eventually reoccupied Constantinople in 743 after besieging
the city. <b><a href="anna.html">Artabasdus</a></b> and his sons were blinded,
but the patriarch Anastasios was allowed to retain his position after being
humiliated. (Constantine had a tendency to keep compromised patriarchs
in office, perhaps as a means of controlling them more easily.) The blinding
of Constantine's ally Sisinnios seems to have been punishment for plotting
against the emperor<b>.<a href="#N_6_">(6)</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b><span size="-1">The East</span></b></p></center>

<p>With his power firmly established, Constantine was able to refocus on
the Arabs, whom he had been intending to engage with prior to the outbreak
of civil war. In 746 he invaded Syria and captured the city of Germanikeia.
In 747 a Byzantine fleet defeated an Arab one off Cyprus. In 752 Constantine
ventured into Armenia and Mesopotamia, occupying Theodosioupolis and Melitene.
It seems that Constantine's successes were assisted by the distractions
faced by the Arabs themselves, such as the establishment of the Abbasid
caliphate, which seems to have led to a truce with Byzantium.<b><a href="#N_7_">(7)</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b><span size="-1">Iconoclasm</span></b></p></center>

<p>The more settled conditions on the eastern frontier are often proposed
as a reason for why Constantine turned his attention to the issue of icons
in the 750s; he simply had the opportunity now. It has also been suggested
however that the recent plague (746-747) gave Constantine pause for thought
and encouraged him to reinforce his father's policy of Iconoclasm<b>.<a href="#N_8_">(8)</a></b>Perhaps
other factors could be the loss of Ravenna to the Lombards in 751 (a blot
on Constantine's copy-book, and certainly a more current concern than the
plague), and increased dynastic confidence with the birth of his son <b><a href="leo4.html">Leo
</a></b>in
750 and his coronation the following year. Whatever the motivations there
is no doubt about Constantine's personal commitment to Iconoclasm. Around
752 the emperor began to espouse the cause in audiences in Constantinople,
and also produced his own tracts on the subject, the
<i>Peuseis </i>('Inquiries'),
of which some fragments survive<b>.<a href="#N_9_">(9)</a></b>But it is
his summoning of a council in 754 and its development of the argument against
icons to encompass Christology for which Constantine is most famous. The
council is known as the Council of Hiereia (due to the location at which
it largely sat from 10 February until 8 August), but as the 'Headless Synod'
by those who opposed it, as it was not presided over by a patriarch of
Constantinople (the see being vacant due to the death of Anastasios; his
replacement Constantine was announced by the emperor in the final session
of the council) and was not attended by any other patriarchs either. Despite
this the 338 bishops who attended supported its <i>Horos</i> ('Definition'),
which survives due to its preservation by the Iconophile Council of Nicaea
of 787. The Council declared that it was impossible to depict Christ in
art as to do so was heretical. It also went on to argue that images of
the saints and the Theotokos were unnecessary. This concern with the cult
of the saints preoccupied Constantine for the rest of his reign. It seems
he went on to renounce relics of saints, but stories that he rejected Mary's
title as Theotokos should be doubted though he was troubled by her cult<b>.<a href="#N_10_">(10)</a></b>
</p><center>
<p><b><span size="-1">The Bulgars</span></b></p></center>

<p>Whilst for the first half of his reign Constantine was preoccupied with
the Arabs and the eastern frontier, for the second half he had to concentrate
mostly on the Bulgars and the northern frontier. Ironically it seems that
it was Constantine's concern for the condition of Thrace that sparked trouble;
his building of towns and transfer of population from Theodosioupolis and
Melitene resulted in a tax demand from the Bulgarians, and his refusal
to pay it led to conflict.<b><a href="#N_11_">(11)</a> </b>This was followed
by a series of campaigns (often on land and sea) (Ostrogorsky (1968) 168
estimates that there were at least nine campaigns in Bulgarian territory)
punctuated by peace, spanning the remainder of his reign and the rule of
diverse Bulgarian leaders (including Teletz and Telerig). Theophanes is
more negative about Constantine's record than Nikephoros, but it is still
clear that the emperor scored major victories at Anchialos in 763 and Lithosoria
in 774. It is true however that the situation was still ongoing at the
time of Constantine's death.
</p><center>
<p><b><span size="-1">The Monks</span></b></p></center>

<p>The 760s also witnessed one of the most debated aspects of the reign
of Constantine V, his persecution of monks. The most famous victim was
Stephen the Younger (a monk from Mt. Auxentios, tortured to death in Constantinople
in 765), though it seems he was not the first or the last. For some the
emperor's hostility to monks is an expression of his Iconoclastic policy;
Brown has famously remarked 'Iconomachy in action is monachomachy'<b>.<a href="#N_12_">(12)</a></b>
However others have not been so quick to swallow this simple equation,
pointing to the complications provided by the evidence. Certainly not all
monks were Iconophiles, so some suggest that Constantine was opposed to
monasticism <i>per se</i><b>.<a href="#N_13_">(13)</a> </b>But this seems
inadequate too, as not all monks were persecuted by Constantine, as the
case of St Anthousa shows.<b><a href="#N_14_">(14)</a> </b>Auzépy
thus suggests that some monks were approved of by the emperor whilst others
were not, and identifies the distinguishing feature as the attitude of
the individual to the empire<b>.<a href="#N_15_">(15)</a> </b>Whittow however
favours a more direct political motivation, pointing to the context of
the major plot against Constantine that was exposed in 766, in which the
patriarch himself was implicated<b>.<a href="#N_16_">(16)</a> </b>This
however seems to overlook the reports of other attacks on monks, such as
those carried out by Michael Lachanodrakon the <i>strategos </i>of the
Thrakesian theme.<b><a href="#N_17_">(17)</a> </b>One theory that Gero
quickly rejected was the idea that Constantine was prompted by a concern
about population size<b>.<a href="#N_18_">(18)</a> </b>Perhaps this is
worth considering again. The sources certainly stress the danger that monasticism
could pose in attracting people away from the secular world (Theophanes
<i>AM</i>
6257), and the punishment meted out to monks can emphasise the taking of
partners.<b><a href="#N_19_">(19)</a></b> Further, throughout his reign
Constantine did take measures to strengthen the population as Nikephoros
and Theophanes make clear; he transferred Syrians to Byzantium after his
seizure of Germanikeia, he repopulated Constantinople with families from
Greece and the islands following the plague, he transferred Syrians and
Armenians to Thrace, he settled Slavs within the empire, and he repaired
the aqueduct of Valens which had been broken since 626. It seems likely
however that the debate about Constantine's treatment of monks will continue.
</p><center>
<p><b><span size="-1">Dynasty and Death</span></b></p></center>

<p>Like his father Constantine was also mindful of the future of the dynasty.
Towards the end of 769 he provided his son <b><a href="leo4.html">Leo</a></b>
with a wife,<b><a href="irene.thm"> Irene</a></b>, who hailed from Greece.
By 771 she had provided her husband with a son, <b><a href="irene.html">Constantine</a></b>,
whose grandfather and namesake was no doubt pleased that the next generation
of the dynasty had already arrived before his death. However Constantine
himself had not been content with a single branch of the family tree (or
with sexual relationships with women: Theophanes <i>AM</i> 6259 mentions
his attraction to Strategios, whilst the <i>Life of Stephen the Younger
</i>hints
at his homosexuality: Auzépy (1997) 232 n. 249 and 265 n. 413).
When Irene the Khazar died he took another wife, Maria. When she also died,
he took the step of marrying Eudokia, who seems to have been very fertile.
With Constantine she had five sons (from eldest to youngest: Christopher,
Nikephoros, Niketas, Anthimus, Eudocimus) but also at least one daughter,
Anthousa, who was a twin of one of the brothers<b>.<a href="#N_20_">(20)</a></b>Thus
<b><a href="leo4.html">Leo
IV</a></b> had a string of half-siblings, and they were not going to be
consigned to the background. During Easter 769 Eudokia was crowned Augusta,
Christopher and Nikephoros were made Caesars, and Niketas <i>nobilissimus</i>.
It seems that Anthimus was also made <i>nobilissimus
</i>before 775.<b><a href="#N_21_">(21)</a></b>
Thus by the time of his death from a fever on 14 September 775 whilst on
campaign against Bulgaria Constantine had ensured that the imperial house
was well-stocked.
</p><center>
<p><b><span size="-1">Aftermath</span></b></p></center>

<div><p>The mixed reputation of Constantine V is well demonstrated by episodes
subsequent to his death. He remained popular with some, such as the forces
of the
<i>tagmata</i> (which he had created) who broke up the Iconophile
Council of 786, and those who in 813 broke into the imperial mausoleum
at Holy Apostles and threw themselves before his tomb and beseeched him
to return and save the empire from the Bulgarians. However with the outbreak
of Second Iconoclasm his memory was intensely reviled, and after the restoration
of icons in 843 Michael III broke up Constantine's sarcophagus and consigned
his remains to fire.<b><a href="#N_22_">(22)</a></b></p></div><p><b><span size="-1">Bibliography</span></b>
