<h3>EARLY HISTORY</h3>





<p>   Little is known of the origins of the emperor Libius Severus (sometimes, apparently incorrectly,

referred to as Livius Severus).  He was described in the <em>Gallic Chronicle of 511</em> and the

<em>Chronicle</em> of Cassiodorus as a Lucanian, and was said to have lived <em>religiose</em> (piously)

(<em>Laterculus imperatorum</em>).  Theophanes and the <em>Paschal Chronicle</em> report that he had the

cognomen ("nickname") "Serpentius."  As the fourth of the so-called "shadow" or "puppet"

western emperors, Severus came to power at a time when the western empire was beset by a

multitude of problems.</p>



<p>     The emperor <a href="major.html"><b>Majorian</b></a> was executed by the barbarian Patrician and Master of Soldiers Ricimer

on 2 August 461.  The western throne then lay vacant for several months.  The Vandal king

Gaiseric went so far as to promote a candidate of his own, as reported by the contemporary

Byzantine historian Priscus: </p>





<p>	"Because Gaiseric no longer abided by the treaty with Majorian [of 461], he sent a

host of Vandals and Moors to sack Italy and Sicily...  Thus an embassy was sent to

Gaiseric, first from Ricimer to say that he ought not utterly to neglect the treaty,

and second from the ruler of the Romans in the east to induce him to retire from

Sicily and Italy and send back the royal women.  Gaiseric, although many

embassies had been sent to him at different times, did not dismiss the women until

he had betrothed the elder daughter of Valentinian (Eudocia was her name) to his

sun Huneric.  Then he sent back Eudoxia, the daughter of Theodosius II, with

Placidia, her other daughter, whom Olybrius had married.  Gaiseric did not cease

from ravaging Italy and Sicily, but pillaged them the more, desiring that, after

Majorian, Olybrius would be emperor of the Romans of the west by reason of his

kinship by marriage." (<em>fr</em>.29: Gordon trans., p.118). </p>





<p>Here, during the interregnum, Ricimer is seen treating with Gaiseric on his own authority.</p>

<h3>ACCESSION</h3>



<p>   Eventually, on 19 November 461, not <a href="olybrius.html"><b>

Olybrius</b></a> but Libius Severus was proclaimed emperor at

Ravenna at Ricimer's instigation.  Theophanes (5955 s.a.455) reported,

 "In this year Majorian was

killed by Ricimer at Tortona, and on the nones of July Severus, nicknamed "Serpentius," was

raised to the culmination of rule."  The <em>Gallic Chronicle of 511</em> noted, "Severus, from Lucania,

was raised to the rank of emperor and at the same time consul," although Severus' consulate was

in fact not until 462.  And Hydatius adds, "Severus was named emperor by the Senate at Rome in

the fifth year of the emperor Leo" (<em>Chron</em>.211).</p>



<h3>REIGN</h3>





<p>   Subsequently, Ricimer acted as the "power behind the throne" and assumed a role unequalled by

previous generals.  There even survives a bronze weight issued by a prefect of Rome with the

inscription <em>salvis dd.nn. et patricio Ricimere</em>: "With the blessing of our Lords and Masters [that

is, the emperors] and the Patrician Ricimer" (<em>CIL</em> 10.8072), sometimes thought to have been

manufactured during the reign of Severus (see <em>PLRE II</em> p.436).  More portentously, some of the

bronze coins of Severus bear a mongogram containing the letters R M C E, which usually are

thought to signify the name of "RiCiMEr."  But several variants also include the letter "A," which

leaves open the possiblilty that this monogram may have some other meaning.</p>





<p>   Severus was never recognized by the eastern emperor Leo (457-474), and thus would have been

viewed in the east as a usurper: the eastern chronicler Marcellinus, for example, asserted that

Severus had "appropriated" <a href="major.html"><b>Majorian's</b></a>

 position, and referred to him as one "who had snatched the

rule of the west" ("<em>qui Occidentis arripuit principatum</em>": s.a.465), and Jordanes noted that after

the death of <a href="major.html"><b>Majorian</b></a>, "Severus 

invaded his place without the permission of the emperor Leo"

("<em>locoque eius sine principis iussu Leonis Severainus invasit</em>": <em>Romana</em> 336).  By this time,

moreover, the direct authority of the western Roman emperor was limited primarily to Italy.  </p>





<p>   Britain, Spain, and Africa had been lost, and Severus was faced by a revolt in Gaul, where an

old ally of <a href="major.html"><b>Majorian</b></a>, the 

Master of Soldiers Aegidius, refused to acknowledge him.  In 462, in a

successful effort to gain the support of the Visigoths against Aegidius, Severus turned over to

them the city of Narbonne, having found an ally in Aegidius' rival, Count Agrippinus.  It may be in

this context that a small issue of coinage in Severus' name was struck at Arles.  Aegidius was

killed in 465, and what was left of Roman authority in Gaul was shakily restored.  Severus would

have been responsible for the initial appointment of Arvandus as Praetorian Prefect of Gaul in

464; in 468 <a href="anthemiu.htm#Note 2"><b>Arvandus</b></a>

 was accused of treason, and even of having imperial ambitions, and placed

on trial in Rome.</p>





<p>   The carrying out of one of the few actions known to have occurred during Severus' reign was,

typically, attributed to Ricimer.  Count Marcellinus recorded, "Beorgor, king of the Alans, was

killed by king Ricimer" ("<em>Beorgor rex Alanorum a Ricimere rege occiditur</em>": <em>s.a.</em>464), and

Cassiodorus notes: "In this year, Beorgor, king of the Alans, was killed at Bergamo by the

Patrician Ricimer" ("<em>his conss. rex Halanorum Beorgor apud Pergamum a patricio Ricimere

peremptus est</em>": no.1278).  The <em>Fasti vindobonenses priores</em> provide the specific date: "In this

year, on 6 February, Beorgor, king of the Alans, was killed at Bergamo, at the foot of the

mountains" ("<em>his cons. occisus est Beorgor rex Alanorum Bergamo ad pede montis VIII idus

Februarias</em>": no.593; see also Jordanes, <em>Getica</em> 236, who wrongly places this attack in the reign

of Anthemius; and Paul the Deacon, <em>Romana</em> 15.1).  This Beorgor is otherwise unknown, but

presumably was leader of some of the Alans who had been settled in Gaul.  His attack on Italy

would have been akin to a raid by 900 Alamanni defeated by <a href="major.html"><b>Majorian</b></a>

 in early 457.</p>





<p>   Severus' reign also saw renewed raids upon the coast of Italy by the Vandals, whose king

Gaiseric still hoped that <a href="olybrius.html"><b>Olybrius</b></a>

 would become western emperor.  John of Antioch reported, </p>



<p>	"Gaiseric ravaged the lands of Italy wanting Olybrius to be emperor of the west

because of his relationship by marriage.  He did not make the obvious pretext for

the war the fact that Olybrius had not become the ruler of the west, but rather that

he had not been given the property of Valentinian and Aëtius.  He demanded this

partly in the name of Eudocia, whom his son had married, and partly since

Gaudentius, Aëtius' son, was living with him" (<em>fr.</em>204: Gordon trans., pp.119-120). </p>





<p>It is in this context that one finds Severus' only attested diplomatic contact with the eastern court,

as reported by Priscus, who noted that during his reign, </p>





<p>	"An embassy came from the Italians and said that they could not resist unless they

reconciled the Vandals to themselves...  Tatian, a man enrolled in the order of

patricians, was sent on an embassy to the Vandals for the sake of the Italians. 

Tatian, having accomplished nothing, at once returned form the Vandals, since his

arguments were not accepted by Gaiseric" (Priscus <em>fr</em>.31-32: Gordon trans.,

p.120).  </p>





<p>In this instance, therefore, the imperial efforts to restrain the Vandals came to nought, and the

Vandals continued to raid the Italian coast.  It was only in 467, when their raids extended to the

Peloponnesus, that the eastern emperor stepped in and named <a href="anthemiu.html"><b>Anthemius</b></a> 

as western emperor.</p>





<p>   A few observations may be made regarding Severus' imperial policies.  As was traditional for

newly proclaimed emperors, Severus held the consulate (recognized in the west only) in 462, his

first full year of rule.  In 463, he appointed as western consul the influential Italian senator Fl.

Caecina Decius Basilius, who also served as his Praetorian Prefect of Italy from 463 to 465, an

office he also had held under <a href="major.html"><b>Majorian</b></a>.  

In 464 and 465, however, no western consuls were

appointed, and two eastern consuls were used.  One of the consuls for 464, moreover, was

<a href="olybrius.html"><b>Anicius Olybrius</b></a>, who had 

claims of his own on the western throne.  Severus' acceptance of the

eastern consular nominees may represent a conciliatory attempt, albeit unsuccessful, to patch up

relations with the eastern court. </p>





<p>   Severus' coins were issued at Rome, Ravenna, and, as seen above, briefly at Arles: he does seem

to have been able to improve the fineness of the gold coinage.  A gold medallion in his name also

is extant.  Two examples of his legislation survive in the <em>Novella</em> ("new laws"), both addressed to

the Praetorian Prefect Basilius and both disingenuously issued in the names of Severus and the

eastern emperor <a href="leo1,htm"><b>Leo</b></a>.  <em>Novella Severi</em> 1 (20 February 463) dealt with inheritances: it nullified

some unspecified provisions of some legislation of 

<a href="major.html"><b>Majorian</b></a>, but confirmed the stipulation that

widows were not to alienate their betrothal gifts, which they held in trust for their children, and

could only dispose of the usufruct.  <em>Novella Severi</em> 2 (25 September 465) forbade children of

slaves and <em>coloni</em> (quasi-free tenant farmers) from escaping servitude by becoming members of

<em>collegia</em> (guilds).  </p>





<h3>DEATH</h3>





<p>   Severus ruled just about four years (pace Jordanes, <em>Getica</em> 236, who gives him only three years:

"<i>tertio anno imperii sui Romae obiit</i>"), and died in Rome in the fall of 465.  The <em>Fasti

vindobonenses priores</em>, which give his date of death as 15 August, seem to be in error given that

one of Severus' laws was issued on 25 September, although it might be possible that the law was

issued posthumously.  In the sixth century, it was said that he had been poisoned by Ricimer

("<em>hiss. conss., ut dicitur, Ricimeris fraude Severus Romae in Palatio veneno peremptus est</em>":

Cass<u></u>iodorus, <em>Chron</em>. s.a. 465), but Sidonius Apollinaris, a much more contemporary source,

asserted in 468 that he died a natural death ("<em>auxerat Augustus naturae lege Severus divorum

numerum</em>": <em>Carm</em>.2.317-8).  <em>PLRE II</em>, p.1005, suggests a date of death of 14 November, but

provides no evidence or justification for it.   </p>





<h3>EPILOGUE</h3>





<p>   The historian Priscus did not even deign to mention Severus' name, merely commenting, "There

were, moreover, still other emperors in the west, but although I know their names well, I shall

make no mention of them whatsoever.  For it so fell out that they lived only a short time after

attaining the office, and as a result of this accomplished nothing worthy of mention..." (<em>Bellum

Vandalicum</em> 7.15-17: Dewing trans., p.69).  Severus is eminently deserving of his place among

the "shadow" emperors. </p>
