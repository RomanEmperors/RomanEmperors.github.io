<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>First, some evolutionary history. 
<a href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/">The Perseus Project</a>, 
a digital library for the humanities, contains a plethora of original 
sources  and an increasing number of secondary sources  for the study of 
Greek and Roman civilization: texts, lexica, plans, maps, images, and 
archaeological catalogs. Archaeological materials are predominantly 
Greek.</p>
<p>The brainchild of Greg Crane, it originated in 1985 as a linguistic 
tool to facilitate the learning of the ancient Greek language. After a 
morphological tool was combined with texts (in ancient Greek) and 
translations of Greek literature, Crane quickly realized the 
multimedia promise of such digital educational tools; that this 
project could also combine literary sources with history, art, and 
archaeology, as a means of exposing the student/scholar to the full 
range of remnants of ancient Greece, including primary materials 
beyond his/her specific focus. Perseus has been published subsequently 
in two Mac-platform CD-Roms, a Platform-independent CD-Rom, and is 
available on the <a href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/">Internet</a>.</p>
<p>Now Renaissance, New World, and other post-Classical materials have 
been added to the ever expanding boundaries of Perseus.</p>
<p>The archaeological materials added to the Perseus Project in its 
earliest phases (up to 1996) on CD-Roms included a selection of 
objects (coins and painted vases as well as sculpture), buildings, and 
sites from the world of Archaic and Classical Greece. Over 70 museums 
generously shared images of their art objects included in 
<i>Perseus</i> 2.0. The atomic objects, that is, those that constitute 
discrete movable entities  coins, vases, sculptures, and even entire 
buildings  were each given their own catalog entries, which followed 
traditional lines (noting specific dates and locations, fabric, 
subject, and form descriptions).</p>
<p>Some more flexible information was added for the archaeological 
sites, which in most cases spanned several occupation periods: take 
the example of the panhellenic site of 
<a href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0042&amp;query=Delphi">Delphi</a>. 
Relevant images were linked to each entry. These catalog entries were 
designed for and perfectly suited the HyperCard environment in which 
the Perseus Project was originally published. With the Perseus Project 
at her/his fingertips the student of ancient Greece could now shuffle 
through the relevant stacks, applying morphological tools to ancient 
texts, as needed, investigating discrete catalog entries, or sorting 
through lists of various archaeological materials   organized in 
whichever order s/he selected. Thus a student of Homer s <i>Iliad</i> 
could search for ancient representations of the hero Achilles with 
which to envision a main character of this epic.</p>
<h4>Using Perseus  archaeological materials as a scholarly resource</h4>
<p>The Perseus Project was envisioned from the beginning as a 
multifaceted library that could have a breadth of material suitable 
for students of all ages and a depth of material suitable for scholars 
at any level. The widespread use of the Perseus Project in high 
schools and colleges attests to the success of the first goal; the 
second  and particularly the degree to which the art and archaeology 
materials in the Perseus Project aid the scholar in his or her 
research  is a debatable matter, which I shall address in this paper.</p>
<p>In constructing this paper I resisted the temptation of stepping 
into my former role, as Art and Archaeology Editor of the Perseus 
Project   to show how far the Project has come and to tell what is to 
come next. These tasks I shall leave to my able colleagues on this 
panel. Rather, I stand firmly in my current role, as a University 
faculty member who uses  or tries to use  the Perseus Project as a tool 
for scholarship. Not just helping us present antiquity intelligibly 
and usefully to our students, but also helping us tackle research 
questions. In this role I shall examine my own use of Perseus on two 
projects, one in which I am now involved and another that I should 
like to pursue.</p>
<p>The collaborative project, 
<a href="https://www.stoa.org/demos"><i>Demos</i></a>, is part of the 
consortium that has created <a href="https://www.stoa.org/">stoa.org</a>. 
You shall hear about that from Chris Blackwell later in this 
conference. It is an on-line reference tool, a collection of original 
sources on democracy in Classical Athens, with some annotation, 
scholarly commentary, and bibliography. In discussing my part in 
creating materials for <i>Demos</i> I shall focus on the issues 
encountered in data mining, efficiently linking materials, and sharing 
data across different web sites.</p>
<p>The second project is an expensive, ambitious, and less evolved 
project, namely a three-dimensional catalog of Greek Sculpture. In 
exploring the idea behind this three-dimensional catalog I shall 
discuss the evolution of the 
<a href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0041">sculpture 
catalog</a> on the Perseus Project, and focus on the fundamental 
differences between print and digital catalogs: how radically 
different a Web catalog might be, in order to take full advantage of 
the digital medium, and to help scholars answer age-old questions.</p>
<h4>Democratic art and archaeology in <i>Demos</i></h4>
<p>To include an art and archaeology component in the 
<a href="https://www.stoa.org/demos"><i>Demos</i></a>
Project first I had to identify and categorize the original monuments 
and visual materials that were relevant to and/or enlightening with 
regard to the evolution of the Athenian democracy, from 508 to 322 BC. 
<i>Demos</i> aims to bring primary sources on Athenian democracy to 
the web in an intelligible manner and encourages the user to dig into 
the data  the original sources  in doing their own research.</p>
<p>What I ve called 
<a href="https://www.stoa.org/demos/demarch.html">democratic archaeology</a> 
constitutes the places and things found in the archaeological record 
that inform us about how Athenian democracy worked.</p>
<p>By <a href="https://www.stoa.org/demos/democraticart.shtml">democratic 
art</a>, however, I mean the art objects that illustrated or 
explicitly reflected aspects of the democracy.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.stoa.org/demos/democraticart.shtml">Democratic Art</a> 
title page serves as one of many portals through which the interested 
user may enter <i>Demos</i>. From there one might skip straight to the 
"<a href="https://www.stoa.org/demos/democraticart.shtml#FR">further reading</a>" 
(traditional, as opposed to Web bibliography). Or one can delve into 
the guts of the catalog. I ve discerned three categories of democratic 
art:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.stoa.org/demos/portraits.html">Images of 
historical individuals</a>, i.e., portraits
</li><li><a href="https://www.stoa.org/demos/heroes.html">Images of tribal 
heroes</a>, i.e., the eponymous heroes of Athens
</li><li><a href="https://www.stoa.org/demos/personifications.html">Images 
of political personifications</a></li></ul>


<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
</td>
<td>
<p>For portraits in <i>Demos</i> I have narrowed the range down to 
historical figures who strongly influenced the democracy   generals and 
statesmen, as well as writers whose works appear prominently elsewhere 
in <i>Demos</i>, notably 
<a href="https://www.stoa.org/demos/portraits.html#Aristotle">Aristotle</a> 
and <a href="https://www.stoa.org/demos/portraits.html#Aristotle">Plato</a>. 
The origins of portraiture in Greece go back to the 
<a href="https://www.stoa.org/demos/portraits.html#Harmodios">Tyrannicides</a>
 Harmodios and Aristogeiton  the pair of lovers who killed Hipparchos, 
the brother of the Athenian tyrant, Hippias, in 514 (they are 
illustrated here on a composite copy in Naples; not after a copy of 
the original portrait created by Antenor, but after the copy of 477/6 
by Kritios and Nesiotes). They didn t quite end the tyranny: this was, 
after all, a lover s spat. They failed to kill Hippias, were caught 
and killed themselves, but therein became civic heroes, credited 
posthumously with the overthrow of the tyranny in 511/10.</p>
<p>If you want to read more about it  dig into the source material  you 
could follow the text links to the Perseus server. After a brief 
explanation of the Tyrannicides, with links to the relevant ancient 
texts, there is a discussion of the evidence regarding the creation of 
their portraits. And we follow up with the extant portraits. 
Inevitably Roman copies are prominent in the extant portraits section, 
but I ve only included representative or particularly illuminating 
Roman copies, rather than an exhaustive list of them</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><p>The <a href="https://www.stoa.org/demos/heroes.html">eponymous heroes</a> 
who constitute my second category, are the heroes who were assigned, 
in consultation with Apollo s oracle at Delphi, as the named heroes of 
each of the ten tribes of Athens   the new political and military units 
into which Attica was divided after the Kleisthenic reforms of 508/7, 
thus Erechtheus for the Erechtheis tribe, and so on. Erechtheus is 
thought to be represented on the Choiseul Marble (shown here), a 
relief decorated Parthenon Treasury Account (of 410/09). This is 
political, but because of the diversity of scenes in which these 
heroes appear, and their common appearances together, in this section 
I have separated the heroes from the art. After an introductory 
discussion of the <a href="https://www.stoa.org/demos/heroes.html#TH">heroes 
as a group</a>, there is the encyclopaedic text
on the <a href="https://www.stoa.org/demos/heroes.html#IH">individual heroes</a>: 
the mythology, worship, and tribal connections that are attested in 
the ancient sources. Then the images of the heroes, divided into 
sculptures and paintings, and different variations within those 
categories. Thus the data can be approached either from the 
perspective of the hero or of the objects   whatever suits the 
individual researcher s needs.</p>
</td>

</td></tr></tbody></table>
<table>
<tbody><tr>

</td>
<td><p>And finally we come to images of 
<a href="https://www.stoa.org/demos/personifications.html">political 
personifications</a>, perhaps the most overlooked of these three 
categories. But among the Classical vases with labels painted on the 
vases, there is a high preponderance of personifications with 
political names. Here is the well known example of the statue of 
Eirene (Peace), holding Ploutos, the god of wealth. Sculpted by 
Praxiteles  father, Kephisodotos, she was erected in the late 370s BC, 
perhaps after the Peace of Kallias, and placed near the Agora. This 
statue, known from Roman copies, such as the illustrated one in 
Munich, as well as Panathenaic vases (of 369 BC), was not the only 
image of Eirene known in Classical Athens. The copies of Kephisodotos  
statue are enumerated in the 
<a href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0041&amp;query=entry%3dEirene+and+Ploutos+type">Perseus 
sculpture catalog</a>; the other appearances of Eirene are enumerated 
on <i>Demos</i>, as for all other political personifications.</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Democratic archaeology on <i>Demos</i> remains at an 
<a href="https://www.stoa.org/demos/demarch.html">outline stage</a>, 
but it is there for your perusal. The monuments and materials  many of 
which have been found through the efforts of the American School of 
Classical Studies at Athens, in their Agora excavations  give us 
insights into how the democratic process actually worked.</p>
<h4>Creating the Resource</h4>
<p>The first issue one encounters in creating a web resource is 
copyright. I have taken the lazy but safe option, so far, and used my 
own images, those that I shot, as photographer, with no special 
agreements. For other images not yet shown, I am seeking permissions 
from relevant authorities, especially museums.</p>
<p>But without those images, if and where the Perseus Project has 
those images or materials, why not link to them? And while I was art 
and archaeology editor of the Perseus Project I actually added 
democratic materials to their database, so that <i>Demos</i> and 
others could link into them! That catalog is a better depository for 
the arcane details, so we don t have to overburden Stoa or  worse 
yet  create a competing catalog on Stoa.</p>
<p>To link appropriately into Perseus one has to have the right terms,
spelled in a uniform manner, and the same catalog numbers designated. 
Not British Museum 459 but 
<a href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0041&amp;query=London+459">London 
459</a>, simply because that s how it is entered in the Perseus 
Project. This touches on a big problem encountered early in 
development of the Perseus Project, that variations in spelling and 
nomenclature are standard in ancient studies. The Greek hero Achilles, 
for example, is correctly referred to be transliterations of his Greek 
name (Akhilleus or Akhilles), by Latinized versions of that name 
(Achilleus or Achilles), and by at least one other name, Ligyron. 
While a database of alternate names was built in anticipation of 
variation in spellings and names that the users would wish to employ, 
it was built into the CD-Roms and the earlier Web site as a didactic 
tool. That is, the user would be presented with the variety of names 
by which an object, site, or person might be known, but would then 
have to search individually each alternate name. The Perseus search 
tool now does the searching for us, but the tool is only as good as 
its underlying data, and the system still requires human 
intervention   a person to type the names into the "alternate 
names" database, as they crop up.</p>
<p>This has not yet been done for the Athenian heroes and lovers, 
Harmodios and Aristogeiton, otherwise known as the Tyrannicides. But 
one can find the connection through the image caption, which is now 
regularly searched by Perseus  
<a href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/sor">look-up tool</a>. 
But how can a search engine make distinctions between the many ancient 
individuals and places that share names? The overworked Perseus 
programmers are currently reworking the ontological basis for the 
project s data, so that the search tool should, in the future, be 
able to distinguish between people and places, places in different 
regions, and so on. The ontology should also serve as a source of 
keywords and thus a separate research tool.</p>
<p>Even synonyms and alternate spellings (e.g., pottery v. ceramic or 
terracotta v. terra cotta) were not sufficiently standardized in 
earlier versions of the Perseus Project to enable the program to infer 
all necessary cross-references. In the catalogs themselves a certain 
amount of consistency has been created through the use of pop-up 
menus.</p>
<p>Of course, for the CD products, a system of keywords was 
established to allow for searching across multiple catalogs and lists 
of catalog entries: a keyword search for "pomegranate" in 
coins would generate a list of two coins with images of this food 
item. Yet the keywords were limited to iconographic terms (scenes 
shown, individuals pictured, and attributes worn/held by those 
characters) AND one could only search one catalog at a time with these 
keywords; this obviously limited ones ability to find comparable 
images in different media. But now the programmers have enabled the 
Perseus search mechanism to search through keywords as well as names, 
summary descriptions, artists, materials, and captions. Although the 
developers went to great lengths to include the vast majority of 
iconographic types, the original database of keywords was limited to 
subject matter included in the original group of archaeological 
materials; additional keywords for novel subjects shown on newer 
materials had to be generated by hand, rather than inferentially in 
the program.</p>
<p>Automatically generated links between discrete texts are improved 
with a good ontology. When comparanda, ancient and modern texts, and 
Greek and Latin words are included in the archaeology databases, they 
must also be tagged so that relevant links will be generated. Further 
resources may be accessed only if the data is consistent or thorough, 
with, for example, standardized bibliographic citations. As a teacher 
and a scholar I anxiously await the new Perseus ontology.</p>
<p>In anticipation of the development of such an ontology for Perseus 
and/or for Stoa, the text I have written for <i>Demos</i> has been 
tagged with smart tags  in XML  that distinguish artists from authors 
from other historical individuals, from heroes, and so forth. For now 
these characters are merely highlighted, and hyperlinked to the 
internal text. So, just as links have been made to the Perseus catalog 
entries that don t exist, in the form in which they should exist, 
eventually, when the ontology exists, these tags will enable easy 
linking to the ontology, which in turn will be a source of 
cross-references and a resource tool in itself.</p>
<p>Hypertext links are the basic advantage of a digital versus a 
conventional library. Some connections rely on thoughtful database 
design, as in the case of our sculpture database, so at this point I 
shall turn my attention to the potential scholarly value of digital 
catalogs in general, and particularly for sculpture.</p>
<h4>The Digital Potential for Object Catalogs</h4>
<p>Catalogs have come a long way in this century. In the 1920s museum 
catalogs claimed to be written for the interested lay audience, but 
were written in a manner that makes them barely intelligible to a 
first year graduate student. Now we have 
<a href="https://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/compass">COMPASS</a>, the 
British Museum s on-line catalog. As in contemporary print catalogs, 
images are better, descriptions are less descriptive, less analytical, 
and less scholarly, but there is plenty of contextual information, 
such as findspot, collection history, and information on techniques of 
manufacture. An extended description and discussion could be provided, 
of course, for those who seek more. Links could be provided to 
materials off the British Museum web site, but the best you get in 
this respect is a link to the British Museum s on-line bookshop where 
you can buy relevant sources by British Museum scholars writing in 
books published by the British Museum Press!</p>
<p>The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, kindly granted the Perseus Project 
permission to include their most extensive catalog, 
<a href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0003">Caskey 
and Beazley s 3-volume catalog of Greek Vases</a> 
in their collection, published in 1931, on the Perseus Project. This 
was a godsend in the early  90s. The black-and-white images were 
scanned and presented with the full text and, as of 1997 anyone, not 
just members of elite academic institutions who happened to own this 
Classic three-volume set, could access Sir John Beazley s erudite texts 
on one of the best collections of Greek vases in the United States. 
Yet not everyone finds the texts as useful as they could be. 
References have not been made useful, the abbreviations remain 
arcane   a secret code that is both unintelligible to the novice student 
and off-putting to the accidental tourist surfing through the world of 
Perseus. Most of the images  the few  are still black-and-white. And 
more of the recent vases in the collection are simply not included. A 
few key pieces in the collection, such as the Agamemnon vase 
attributed to the Dokimasia Painter, have been acquired since 1931. 
This vase, which is, however, included in the Beazley Archive, is the 
great source for a variant on the golden-age question: was it Queen 
Clytaemnestra or her lover Aegisthus who killed King Agamemnon? 
Perseus  visitors won t know, for a while yet. The 
<a href="https://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/">Beazley Archive</a> and 
the Perseus Project have launched on a collaboration, however, merging 
their databases. That would give Perseus viewers access to 60,000 
vases, which constitute an extremely thorough scholarly tool.</p>
<p>The addition of multiple images  as shown, for example, in the case 
of the <a href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0041&amp;query=Berlin%201530">Berlin 
Museum s copy of Kresilas  portrait of Perikles</a>  is one of the 
great boons of Perseus. It far surpasses the illustrative material 
traditionally available in print catalogs. But there is still the 
size issue, in which we are limited by browsers and bandwidth, as 
well as museums. This limitation has been addressed by Perseus with 
its new high-resolution 
<a href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/PR/tiles.html">tiles</a>. A 
catalog of circa 150 gems from the 
<a href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0048">Lewes 
House Collection</a>, now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, is one 
of the first projects conceived with high-resolution images. For now 
the gems are presented through so-called "tombstone" 
labels  scant information about the what, where, and when of gems  while 
we await a Web version of Sir John Boardman s forthcoming scholarly 
update of Beazley s detailed 1920s catalog.</p>
<p>With or without that scholarly detail, however, Maria Daniels  (yet 
to be released!) high resolution photographs  at 18 MB  of each of these 
gems, and their casts, bring them to the fore like no museum display 
ever could. They allow us to study the details better than we could 
with the naked eye. Finally we will all be able to read the 
inscription on this sard scarab 
(<a href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0048&amp;query=Boston+27.723">Boston 27.723</a>) 
without making an appointment to visit the curator, to take 
the relevant gem carefully off display, to procure the magnifying 
glass, to provide the right amount of light, to try to read that 
minuscule inscription labelling Ercle Hercules. Maria and her camera 
have done that for us, and all we need to do is navigate around the 
Perseus site, clicking on the part of the gem that we would like to 
see, at the resolution we prefer. This level of photographic 
documentation is certainly a scholarly tool.</p>
<p>But back to Perseus  sculpture catalog. I would like to think it 
has come a long way since the publication of Perseus  CD-Roms. Despite 
the multitude of images, the hypertext environment and multiple search 
options, Perseus  early catalogs  quickly converted into Web catalogs 
in 1995  still fall short of the promise of the Internet.</p>
<p>Even in 1995 the HyperCard presentation seemed less flexible than 
it had seemed in 1992. In his 1997 review of Perseus 2.0. Nick 
Eiteljorg justifiably complained "the complete separation of text 
and graphics elements in <i>Perseus</i> 2.0 seems more than dated; it 
projects a bias towards words and against images." He also 
provided the most substantial and useful criticism of the sculpture 
catalog   that the catalog information was overly simplified, so that no 
allowance had been made for the existence of copies of famous original 
statues and their relation to each other. Indeed a complex challenge 
is posed by the fragmentary nature of extant Greek sculpture: some 
sculptures are comprised of fragments located in a variety of museums; 
many more (particularly architectural sculptures) once belonged to a 
group that may have been separated through time; and the most famous 
statues from Greek antiquity are lost, yet recognized in multiple 
copies of the originals that proliferated in Roman society.</p>
<p>In fact, there was no interconnection between the sculptural 
pieces, aside from those that adorned the same building. Ancient 
sculpture is fragmentary. Some sculptures exist only in pieces; others 
have been split up; and many of the ancient world s most famous 
statues now survive only in multiple copies created later than the 
originals. The redesign of Perseus  sculpture catalog in 1997-1999 
was intended to bring the visitor s attention to these complexities of 
ancient art. A data field in our database now categorizes artworks 
according to their degree of entirety and automatically generates 
links to related objects. More than one relation for each object is 
permitted, which encourages users to investigate the whole range of 
possible connections. This multirelational database enables our next 
phase of catalog development, which will include the construction of 
series of copies, the contextualization of groups of sculptures, and 
the reconstruction of lost originals.</p>
<p>A preeminent example of all of these relations is the 
<a href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0039&amp;query=Athens,+Parthenon">Parthenon</a>, 
or Temple of Athena Parthenos in Athens. This building was decorated 
with three different types of sculptural forms, metopes  square 
(relief) plaques  on the outer frieze, a continuous relief zone on the 
interior (Ionic frieze), and two sets of pedimental sculptures, one 
on the East façade and one on the West.</p>
<p>Each of these sculptural forms relates to one another and to the 
building as a whole. How do they relate? Of course every scholar has a 
different idea. But each of these forms also represents a separate 
group (or multiple groups) of sculptures, e.g., the discrete metopes 
originally numbered 92. They may also be divided into four 
thematically distinct groups depending on which of the four faces of 
the building they decorated.</p>
<p>The Perseus viewer may now find these interconnections as follows: 
From the Parthenon entry in the architecture catalog one is supposed 
to be able to link to the sculpture entry. (This isn t quite working, 
as of the latest reworking of the user interface.) One could then 
chose one of the entries relating to a particular group. In this case 
I ll choose 
<a href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0041&amp;query=Parthenon+West+Pediment">West Pediment</a>, 
which shows the deities Athena and Poseidon battling for the patronage 
of Athens. And we may view the different fragments known to have 
belonged to the East or the West pediment.</p>
<p>Through the ravages of time, many of the original sculptures have 
been separated from each other, and some reliefs and figures have been 
broken, yet these fragments should still be studied in relation to 
each other. How to fit all the fragments together? Well, that s up to 
the individual scholar, but can t be done until you know  or see  what 
fragments remain.</p>
<p>Many Greek sculptures are known only through almost identical 
copies produced in Roman times, rather than the original art work, and 
such is the case with the chryselephantine (gold and ivory) cult 
statue of 
<a href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0041&amp;query=Athena+Parthenos">Athena Parthenos</a> 
that originally stood within that Temple, but had been lost by late 
antiquity. Of course I could go back to the main architecture entry 
for the Parthenon, from which I could link to the cult statue that was 
housed within it. But the entry on the lost statue links me back to 
known copies, including the stunning modern copy, in the 
<a href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0041&amp;query=Athena+Parthenos+reconstruction">Royal 
Ontario Museum in Toronto</a>. This modern copy takes the cue from 
Roman copies, multiple versions of which were created from the first 
through the third centuries AC.</p>
<p>The Perseus Project s sculpture catalog was redesigned, between 
1997 and 1999, with almost no changes to the existing data and 
relatively few strategic changes to the database itself. The most 
important change was the creation of a new data field, named 
"category," that was used to specify the particular relation 
by which a sculpture might be connected to another. One of a discrete 
number of possible relations would be indicated for each piece: 
"single monument," "statuary group," 
"original/copies," or "separated fragments." The 
pertinent relation thus residing in the database would then indicate 
the way in which that monument should be linked to related monuments. 
In the case of single monument, no relation would be necessary. 
"Statuary group" would generate a link to a specified 
"group" to which the sculpture belonged. 
"Original/copies" would generate a link to specified 
"original" that this sculpture copied. And "separated 
fragments" would likewise generate a link to a specified 
"whole" to which the sculpture originally belonged.  The 
database also permits the existence of more than one such relation for 
each sculpture, as in the case of the Parthenon. </p>
<p>The next stage in the evolution of the Perseus Project s catalog of 
Greek sculpture has come through improvements in the user interface on 
Perseus  Web site. As I have mentioned, the comprehensive text browser 
 the "Lookup" tool  facilitates access between the sculpture 
catalog and other Perseus materials. And a thumbnail browser also 
allows users to browse through objects visually. In the future it 
should also allow for the visual comparison of a selection of images 
of the same or different objects chosen by the user, not by the Lookup 
tool.</p>
<p>More work on contextualizing the individual sculptures, alone and 
in groups, is needed to establish the variety of relations between 
individual sculptures, and representing them intelligibly to the 
widest possible audience. To take full advantage of the multimedia 
digital environment we should be able to present users with 3-D 
visualization of the relationships between particular sculptures and 
of their relationship to sites and buildings. Rapid advances in the 
accuracy of 3-D digital representations are now allowing us to 
accomplish faithful digital reconstructions not only of architectural 
spaces, but also of actual objects   first to rebuild digitally those 
that exist today, and then to extrapolate in an attempt to visualize 
those that are lost to us.</p>
<p>A related database of sculpture types  the art works on which 
copies were based  is also necessary. Scholars have begun to realize 
that Hellenistic and Roman copies of Greek originals should not only 
be studied in their own right (with regard to issues of production, 
collections, taste, and architectural placement/decoration), but that 
there is one-to-many, not a one-to-one relationship of copies to 
originals. That is, copies seem to have copied intermediate types or 
copies of copies of originals. An appropriate treatment of these 
copies  as copies of copies, not necessarily copies of originals 
may be easily tackled in a relational database, so that an infinite 
genealogy of original types, variations, copy types, and subsequent 
copies thereof, may be built into the database. A program might even 
generate a genealogical table that would provide the interested viewer 
with a quick overview of the relation of several related sculptures in 
the nexus of originals and copies.</p>
<p>An exciting multimedia means of visualization is 3-D reconstruction 
of the original placement of the sculptures, which would show each 
sculpture in relation to one another and to the architectural complex 
of which it played an integral part. Although several ambitious 
projects have attempted to provide accurate scholarly reconstructions 
of some important monuments from classical antiquity, none, to our 
knowledge, have attempted to provide accurate renderings of the 
sculptural decoration of these monuments, but have rather aimed to 
provide architecturally precise spaces. Rudimentary architectural 
reconstructions may at least provide contexts in which images of 
sculptures  both architectural and those in the round  may be 
visualized. Perseus hopes eventually to have reconstructions of the 
spatial and architectural complexes in which many of the sculptures in 
our catalog were originally found, starting with the Apollo sanctuary 
at Delphi, discussed in Tom Milbank s contribution to this conference.</p>
<p>A more ambitious future project that involves the relation of 
copies to originals, and of separated fragments to each other is the 
implementation of 3-D scanning technology to create digital images of 
existing copies or fragments and subsequent reconstructions of the 
original sculptural works on which they were based or to which they 
belonged. A detailed measurement and analysis of the copies/fragments 
would enable one to usefully superimpose missing parts of some copies 
on others, to scale each copy to the same "actual size," to 
adjust for copyists additions or changes (e.g., to account for 
dimensions that may have been foreshortened in a relief 
representation), and finally to arrive at a clearer picture of the 
original statue(s) on which copies were based.</p>
<p>The technology to enable an accurate digital rendering of the 
originals is already available, and is now being employed by its 
inventor, Marc Levoy of the Stanford University Computer Graphics Lab, 
in the study of the sculptures of 
<a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/projects/mich">Michelangelo</a>, 
as well as the 
<a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/projects/forma-urbis">Severan Marble Plan</a>. 
While this laser scanning technology has proved successful in the 
digital recreation of known sculptures, the data acquired through such 
a process has not yet been used a basis for comparison of similar 
copies and extrapolation that might render the most faithful 
recreations of long lost ancient masterpieces. Such an adaptation of 
this scanning technology might also enable scholars at all levels to 
digitally create their own reconstructions. This is my earnest wish 
for the future.</p>
