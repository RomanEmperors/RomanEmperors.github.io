<h3>Constantine III (407-411 A.D.)</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Constantine's origins are obscure and we know little about him as a man,
though later Gallic writers described him as a glutton and as fickle.
Orosius describes him as a soldier acclaimed only because of his name, Fl.
Claudius Constantinus. His two sons were named <a href="westemp5.htm#Note 3"><b>Constans</b></a> and Julian, though
these may not have been their original names.</p>

<p>Constantine was acclaimed in spring 407 in Britain to replace <a href="honorius.htm#Note 2"><b>Gratian</b></a>.
After crossing to Gaul, his authority was swiftly accepted there and in
Spain. The Rhine was rapidly secured. Nothing is known about the troops
used by Constantine, or whether he permanently withdrew troops from
Britain. <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius</b></a> sent a force under Sarus from Italy against Constantine,
but, despite his initial successes in the Rhone valley, Sarus was soon
forced to withdraw by Constantine's <i>magister militum</i> Gerontius. Constantine
went on to occupy all of Gaul up to the Alps. By May 408, he was in control
of Arles, site of the headquarters of the Gallic praetorian prefecture,
which he made his base. Constantine appointed <a href="westemp5.htm#Note 3"><b>Constans</b></a> as Caesar in 408 and
sent him into Spain where some of <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius'</b></a> relatives had started a revolt.
This revolt was suppressed, and the <i>magister militum</i> Gerontius was left in
charge in Spain when <a href="westemp5.htm#Note 3"><b>Constans</b></a> returned to Gaul.</p>

<p>In 409, Constantine's difficulties began to increase. At about this time,
Britain revolted against Constantine's rule. Constantine wrote to <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius</b></a>
in late summer 409, asking forgiveness for having seized power and
promising help against the Visigoth Alaric in Italy. <a href="westemp5.htm#Note 3"><b>Honorius</b></a> recognized him, sending an
imperial robe to Constantine and possibly granting him the consulate. In
late 409, several barbarian groups, the Vandals, Alans and Suevi, crossed
into Spain from Gaul. Gerontius was able to restore control over the
situation, but then revolted against Constantine and acclaimed <a href="westemp5.htm#Note 4"><b>Maximus</b></a> as
emperor. Control of Britain and Spain was thus lost. In summer 410,
Constantine crossed the Alps into Liguria, probably after negotiating with
<a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius'</b></a> <i>magister equitum</i>, Allobichus. Constantine then retreated to Gaul
when he learned of the death of Allobichus whom <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius</b></a> suspected of
treachery. Constantine was then faced by troops from Spain who had invaded
Gaul under Gerontius, who besieged him in Arles. By now, Gerontius had
promoted his son (possibly one of his staff), <a href="westemp5.htm#Note 4"><b>Maximus</b></a>, to the rank of Augustus. After Alaric's
death, <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius'</b></a> general <a href="westemp5.htm#Note 8"><b>Constantius</b></a> entered Gaul in 411 and, after
defeating Gerontius, in turn besieged Constantine in Arles. When a
relieving force was ambushed by <a href="westemp5.htm#Note 8"><b>Constantius</b></a>, Constantine lost hope. He
relinquished the purple, took refuge in a church and was ordained before
surrendering to <a href="westemp5.htm#Note 8"><b>Constantius</b></a>. Constantine was then sent to Italy, but was
murdered before he reached <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius</b></a>. His head was sent to Ravenna where it
was exhibited from September 18, 411.</p>

<h3>
Constans II  (409-411 A.D.)</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Constans was the elder of the two sons of <a href="westemp5.htm#Note 2"><b>Constantine III</b></a> who had rebelled
against <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius</b></a> in 407 and controlled Gaul, Spain and Britain. His father
appointed him as Caesar in Gaul in 408 and sent him into Spain where some
of <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius'</b></a> relatives had started a revolt. This revolt was suppressed,
some of <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius'</b></a> relatives were executed, and the <i>magister militum</i>
Gerontius was left in charge in Spain. Constans left his wife and court at
Saragossa in Spain and returned to Arles in Gaul. In September 409 several
barbarian groups (Suevi, Alans, Vandals) broke into Spain through the
Pyrenees. <a href="westemp5.htm#Note 2"><b>Constantine III</b></a> raised Constans to the rank of Augustus in late 409
or early 410 before sending him back to Spain; lead elements of Constans'
army were sent into the peninsula. The threat of being replaced prompted
Gerontius to revolt, acclaiming <a href="westemp5.htm#Note 4"><b>Maximus</b></a> as emperor, and to join forces with
the barbarians who had recently entered Spain. When the news of Gerontius'
revolt and <a href="westemp5.htm#Note 4"><b>Maximus'</b></a> seizure of power was received at Arles, Constans
abandoned the expedition and stayed in Gaul.  In 411 Gerontius invaded Gaul
where he besieged and captured Constans at Vienne. After his capture,
Constans was executed by Gerontius.</p>

<h3>Maximus (409-422 A.D.) </h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Maximus was the son (or possibly a retainer) of Gerontius, a general of
<a href="westemp5.htm#Note 2"><b>Constantine III</b></a> in Spain in 409. His character was described as modest and
humble. After Gerontius rebelled against <a href="westemp5.htm#Note 2"><b>Constantine III</b></a>, he acclaimed
Maximus as Augustus in Tarraco. Gerontius then marched into Gaul, leaving
Maximus in Spain. When he learnt of the defeat of Gerontius by <a href="westemp5.htm#Note 8"><b>Constantius</b></a>
at Arles in 411, Maximus fled to the barbarian troops who had remained in
Spain. After his flight, little is known of Maximus. He was apparently
still alive in 417, and is probably the Maximus captured in Spain in 422
and executed at Ravenna.</p>

<h3>Attalus (409-410, 414-415 A.D.)</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Priscus Attalus was Augustus twice, 409-410 and 414-415. He was a Greek
from Asia whose father had moved to Italy under <a href="vali.html"><b>Valentinian I</b></a>. Attalus was
prominent in the Senate in the early fifth century and remained a pagan. In
409 he was appointed as Urban Prefect of Rome by <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius</b></a>. After Alaric
occupied Rome in late 409, he acclaimed Attalus emperor. Attalus
represented the interests of many of the senatorial aristocrats, interests
which differed from those of the emperor <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius</b></a> in Ravenna. This limited
the appeal of Attalus' authority to Italy and even here he was not
universally accepted.  Attalus was baptized during his reign by an Arian
Gothic bishop. An expedition was sent against the <i>comes Africae</i>
Heraclianus, but was unsuccessful. In the summer, Attalus marched on
Ravenna in the company of Alaric. During negotiations, Honorius offered to
share power with Attalus, but Attalus rejected his offer and continued to
besiege Ravenna. The failure of the African expedition allowed Heraclianus
to control shipments of grain to Italy, causing shortages of food there.
 When Attalus returned to Rome, he refused to allow a Goth to command a
second expedition against Africa. This act induced Alaric to depose Attalus
in summer 410 and to attempt to negotiate again with <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius</b></a>. These
 negotiations failed, and soon afterwards, Alaric sacked Rome.</p>

<p>After his removal from power, Attalus remained with the Goths, even when
they moved to Gaul. When Ataulf married <a href="galla.html"><b>Galla Placidia</b></a> at Narbo in early
414, Attalus delivered the wedding speech. Later in 414, <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius'</b></a> general
<a href="westemp5.htm#Note 8"><b>Constantius</b></a> (who went on to become emperor in 421) blockaded the Goths and
began more aggressive military action. In reply, Ataulf acclaimed Attalus
as Augustus. <a href="westemp5.htm#Note 8"><b>Constantius'</b></a> blockade was effective and forced the Goths to
move into Spain in 415. Attalus attempted to escape from the Goths but was
captured by <a href="westemp5.htm#Note 8"><b>Constantius'</b></a> forces. When Attalus was captured, he was sent to
Ravenna. From here, he was mutilated, led in triumph in Rome and then
exiled to the Lipari islands in 416.</p>

<h3>Jovinus (411-413 A.D.)</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Jovinus was from a noble Gallic family, probably from the south of Gaul.
After the defeat of <a href="westemp5.htm#Note 2"><b>Constantine III</b></a> in 411 and the departure of <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius'</b></a>
troops to Italy, Jovinus seized power at Mainz with the support of some
Alans under Goar and Burgundians under Guntiarius. He was also strongly
supported by the Gallic aristocracy and minted coins in Lyon, Trier and
Arles. In early 412, Ataulf and his Goths entered Gaul and began to
negotiate with Jovinus. Negotiations were broken off when Sarus, a
blood-enemy of Ataulf, offered his services to Jovinus. Jovinus then
acclaimed his brother <a href="westemp5.htm#Note 7"><b>Sebastianus</b></a> as Augustus in 412. The acclamation of
<a href="westemp5.htm#Note 7"><b>Sebastianus</b></a> caused Ataulf to reopen negotiations with <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius</b></a>. When
<a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius</b></a> accepted the offer, Ataulf besieged Jovinus at Valentia in 413.
After his capture, Jovinus was sent to Narbo where he was executed by
Dardanus. His head arrived at Ravenna in late August.</p>

<h3>Sebastianus (412-413 A.D.)</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Sebastianus was a southern Gallic aristocrat, and a brother of <a href="westemp5.htm#Note 6"><b>Jovinus</b></a> who had
seized power in Gaul in 411 after the defeat of <a href="westemp5.htm#Note 2"><b>Constantine III</b></a>. Very
little is known of Sebastianus except that he had a weak personality.
Sebastianus was acclaimed as Augustus by <a href="westemp5.htm#Note 6"><b>Jovinus</b></a> in 412 after negotiations
with the Gothic king Ataulf had been broken off. Coins were minted for
Sebastianus at Arles and Trier. Sebastianus was captured by Ataulf and
executed by <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius'</b></a> Gallic praetorian prefect Dardanus in 413. After his
execution, his head arrived at Ravenna in late August.</p>

<h3>Constantius III (421 A.D.)</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Constantius was a soldier from Naissus in Dacia. Although he presented a
fierce facade in public, he was far more relaxed in private and at
banquets. Constantius was a Catholic. He had a successful career as one of
the most important <i>magistri militum</i> of <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius</b></a> after the death of Stilicho
in 408. He was able to defeat Gerontius and <a href="westemp5.htm#Note 2"><b>Constantine III</b></a> in Gaul in 411
and expelled the Goths under Ataulf from Italy in 412. Constantius married
<a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius'</b></a> half-sister <a href="galla.html"><b>Galla Placidia</b></a> in 417 at the urging of <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius</b></a>; and
they produced a son, <a href="valenIII.html"><b>Valentinian (III)</b></a> in 419. On February 8, 421 Constantius was
acclaimed as Augustus in the West and <a href="galla.html"><b>Galla Placidia</b></a> was raised to the
dignity of Augusta. These statuses were not recognized in the East.
Constantius was said at his death to have been planning a campaign against
<a href="theo2.html"><b>Theodosius II</b></a> because of this slight. He died of illness September 2, 421.
Although he was not emperor for long, he complained about the burden of
office-holding, especially his loss of personal freedom.</p>

<h3>Ioannes (423-425 A.D.)</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>After the death of <a href="honorius.html"><b>Honorius</b></a> on August 15, 423, his closest male relative
was <a href="valenIII.html"><b>Valentinian</b></a>, son of <a href="galla.html"><b>Galla Placidia</b></a>. <a href="valenIII.html"><b>Valentinian </b></a>was currently at
Constantinople. This power vacuum allowed Ioannes, the <i>primicerius
notariorum</i> (chief notary) to seize power in the west. Virtually nothing is
known of Ioannes himself, though he was said to have had a mild character.
He was supported by the <i>magister militum</i> Castinus and by Aetius, son of the
<i>magister militum</i> Gaudentius. After his acclamation at Rome, Ioannes transferred
his capital to Ravenna. Ioannes' rule was accepted in Gaul, Spain and
Italy, but not in Africa. Ioannes' attempts to negotiate with the eastern
emperor <a href="theo2.html"><b>Theodosius II</b></a> were unsuccessful. He seems not to have had a firm
grasp of power and this encouraged eastern intervention. In 425, <a href="theo2.html"><b>Theodosius
II</b></a> sent an expedition under the command of Ardabur the Elder to install

capture, Ioannes was taken to Aquileia where he was mutilated, then
executed. Three days after Ioannes's execution, one of his generals,
Aetius, arrived in Italy with a large force of Huns. Rather than continue
the war, <a href="valenIII.html"><b>Valentinian</b></a> bought off the Huns with gold and Aetius with the
