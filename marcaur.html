<p><strong>Introduction and Sources</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Vita</em> of the emperor in the collection known as the <em>Historia Augusta</em> identifies him in its
heading as <em>Marcus Antoninus Philosophus</em>, "Marcus Antoninus the Philosopher." Toward the end
of the work, the following is reported about him, <em>sententia Platonis semper in ore illius fuit,
florere civitates si aut philosophi imperarent aut imperantes philosopharentur</em> (27.7), "Plato's
judgment was always on his lips, that states flourished if philosophers ruled or rulers were
philosophers."  It is this quality of Marcus' character which has made him a unique figure in
Roman history, since he was the only emperor whose life was molded by, and devoted to,
philosophy (Julian was the second and last).  His reign was long and troubled, and in some ways showed the weaknesses of empire
which ultimately led to the "Decline and Fall," yet his personal reputation, indeed his sanctity,
have never failed of admirers.  Contributing to his fame and reputation is a slender volume of
Stoic philosophy which served as a kind of diary while he was involved in military campaigns, the
<em>Meditations</em>, a book which can be described as an <em>aureus libellus</em>, a little golden book. </p>
<p>The sources for understanding Marcus and his reign are varied but generally disappointing.  There
is no major historian.  The chief literary sources are the biography in the <em>Historia Augusta</em>, as well
as those of <a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian</b></a>, <a href="tonypis.html"><b>Antoninus</b></a>, <a href="lverus.html"><b>Verus</b></a>, and Avidius Cassius.  Debate about this collection of
imperial biographies has been heated and contentious for more than a century.  In all likelihood, it
is the work of a single author writing in the last years of the fourth-century.  The information
offered ranges from the precisely accurate to the wildly imaginative.</p>
<p>Cassius Dio, who wrote in the decade of the 230s, produced a long history of the empire which
has survived, for our period, only in an abbreviated version.  Fourth century historians, such as
Aurelius Victor and Eutropius, occasionally furnish bits of information.  Marcus' teacher, Fronto,
a distinguished orator and rhetorician, is extremely useful.  Papyri, inscriptions, coins, legal
writings, and some of the church writers, such as Tertullian, Eusebius, and Orosius, are very
important.  Archaeology and art history, with their interpretation of monuments, make the history
of Marcus' principate literally visible and offer important clues for understanding the context of his actions..</p>
<p><strong>Early Life</strong></p>
<p>He was born M. Annius Verus on April 26, 121, the scion of a distinguished family
of Spanish origin (<em>PIR<sup>2</sup></em> A697).  His father was Annius Verus (<em>PIR</em><sup>2</sup> A696), his mother Domitia
Lucilla (<em>PIR</em><sup>2</sup> D183).  His grandfather held his second consulate in that year and went on to reach
a third in 126, a rare distinction in the entire history of the principate, and also served <a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian</b></a> as
city prefect.<a href="#N_1_"><b>[[1]]</b></a>  The youth's education embraced both rhetoric and philosophy; his manner was
serious, his intellectual pursuits deep and devoted, so that the emperor <a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian</b></a> took an interest in
him and called him "<i>Verissimus</i>," "Most truthful," by punning on his name.<a href="#N_2_"><b>[[2]]</b></a>  He received
public honors from an early age and seems to have long been in <a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian's</b></a> mind as a potential
successor.  When <a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian's</b></a> first choice as successor, L. Ceionius Commodus, died before his
adoptive father, the second choice proved more fruitful.  The distinguished senator T. Aurelius
Fulvus Boionius Arrius Antoninus, from Cisalpine Gaul, did succeed <a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian</b></a>, whose
arrangements for the succession planned for the next generation as well.  He required Antoninus
to adopt the young Verus, now to be known as M. Aelius Aurelius Verus, as well as Commodus'
son, henceforth known as L. Aelius Aurelius Commodus (<em>PIR<sup>2</sup></em> C606).  The former was a bit more
than seventeen years old, the latter was eight.</p>
<p><strong>Career under Antoninus Pius</strong></p>
<p>The long tenure of <a href="tonypis.html"><b>Antoninus Pius</b></a> proved one of the most peaceful and prosperous in Roman
history.  The emperor himself was disinclined to military undertakings and never left Italy during
his reign.  Disturbances to the <em>pax Romana</em> occurred on the fringes of empire.  Responses were
decisive and successful, with legates in charge in the provinces.  As a consequence, neither Caesar
gained military experience nor was shown to the armies, a failing which later could have proved
decisive and disastrous.  Marcus rose steadily through the <em>cursus honorum</em>, holding consulates in
140 and 145, combining magistracies with priesthoods.  He received the <em>tribunicia potestas</em> in
147, and perhaps also <em>imperium proconsulare</em>.  Yet he never neglected the <em>artes liberales</em>.  His
closest contacts were with Fronto (c.95-c.160), the distinguished rhetorician and orator.<a href="#N_3_"><b>[[3]]</b></a>  His
acquaintance included many other distinguished thinkers, such as Herodes Atticus (c.95-177), the
Athenian millionaire and sophist,<a href="#N_4_"><b>[[4]]</b></a> and Aelius Aristides (117-c.181), two of whose great
speeches have survived and which reveal much of the mood and beliefs of the age.<a href="#N_5_"><b>[[5]]</b></a>  Yet it was
Epictetus (c.50-c.120) who had the greatest philosophical impact <a href="#N_6_"><b>[[6]]</b></a> and made him a firm
Stoic.<a href="#N_7_"><b>[[7]]</b></a>  In the year 161 Marcus celebrated his fortieth birthday, a figure of noble appearance
and unblemished character.  He was leading a life which gave him as much honor and glory as he
could have desired, probably much more than his private nature enjoyed, yet his life, and that of
the empire, was soon to change.  The emperor died on March 7, but not before clearly indicating
to magistrates and senate alike his desire that Marcus succeed him by having the statue of
<em>Fortuna</em>, which had been in his bedroom, transferred to Marcus.<a href="#N_8_"><b>[[8]]</b></a>  There was no opposition,
no contrary voice, to his succession.  He immediately chose his brother as co-emperor, as Hadrian had planned.  From the
beginning of the year they were joint consuls and held office for the entire year.  Their official
titulature was now <em>Imperator Caesar M. Aurelius Antoninus Augustus</em> and <em>Imperator Caesar L.
Aurelius Verus Augustus.</em>  The military qualities adumbrated by the word <em>Imperator</em> were soon
much in demand, for the empire was under pressure in the year 161 in Britain, in Raetia, and in the
east, where Parthia once again posed a significant danger.<a href="#N_9_"><b>[[9]]</b></a></p>
<p><strong>The Parthian War (161-166)</strong></p>
<p>The incursion in northern Britain and the difficulties along the Danube were soon satisfactorily
managed by legates.  The danger in the East was of a different magnitude.  Tensions between Rome and Parthia had intensified in
the last years of <a href="tonypis.html"><b>Antoninus'</b></a> reign  over control of Armenia, the vast
buffer state which had often aroused enmity between the two powers, since each wished to be able
to impose a king favorable to its interests.  With <a href="tonypis.html"><b>Antoninus'</b></a> death and the uncertainty attendant
upon a new emperor (in this case two, a dyarchy, for the first time in Rome's history), the
Parthian monarch, Vologaeses III, struck rapidly, placed his own candidate upon the Armenian
throne, and inflicted severe setbacks upon the Roman forces sent to oppose him.  Marcus decided
to send his colleague <a href="lverus.html"><b>Lucius Verus</b></a>, whose imperial prestige would underscore the seriousness of
the empire's response.  <a href="lverus.html"><b>Verus</b></a> lacked military experience and was sorely lacking in the attributes of
leadership and command; further, he was notorious for being chiefly interested in amusements and
luxury.  But Marcus surrounded him with several of the best generals at the empire's disposal,
chief among them <a href="avcass.html"><b>Avidius Cassius</b></a> (c.130-175)(<em>PIR</em><sup>2</sup> A1402).  From 162 on, Rome's successes
and conquests were extensive and decisive.  Most of Parthia's significant cities and strongholds,
such as Seleucia and Ctesiphon, were stormed and destroyed, and the army's movements eastward
recalled the movements of Alexander the Great some five centuries earlier.  By 166, Parthia had
capitulated and a Roman nominee sat on the Armenian throne.  The victory appeared to be the
most decisive since <a href="trajan.html"><b>Trajan's</b></a>  conquest of Dacia, but, when <a href="lverus.html"><b>Verus</b></a> returned to Italy with his
triumphant army, there came also a devastating plague, which had enormous effect on all 
provinces.</p>
<p>As is the case with all ancient diseases, it is almost impossible to identify this one.  In all likelihood, 
however, it was smallpox; how severe the toll was is debated.<a href="#N_10_"><b>[[10]]</b></a>
 Clearly, it cast a pall
over the triumph celebrated by the two emperors, who were honored with the titles <em>Armeniacus</em>
and <em>Parthicus</em>.  The last years of this decade were dominated by efforts to overcome the plague
and provide succour to its victims.  But already in 166, the German tribes smashed the
 Danubian <i>limes</i>, threatening  the empire's stability and even existence,more than Parthia had ever done.
had come a far greater threat to the
empire's stability, indeed existence, than that of Parthia had been.   The first campaigns were punctuated by the death of
<a href="lverus.html"><b>Verus</b></a> in 169, leaving Marcus as sole emperor.  And so began the most difficult period of his life.</p>
<p><strong>The German Wars</strong></p>
<p>Early in 169, the Marcomanni and Quadi crossed the Danube, penetrated the intervening
provinces, and entered Italy.  The culmination of their onslaught was a siege of Aquileia.  The
effect upon the inhabitants of the peninsula was frightful.  This was the first invasion of Italy since
the late second century B.C., when the Cimbri and Teutones had been separately crushed by
Marius.  Perhaps more vivid in the collective imagination was the sack of Rome by the Gauls in
387, when the city was saved only by the payment of ransom.  </p>
<p>The two emperors hastened north, after a rapid mobilization of forces, which included the drafting
of slaves, since the manpower potential of the empire had been so impaired by the consequences
of the plague and the losses and troop commitments in the East.  <a href="lverus.html"><b>Verus</b></a>
 died while in the north;<a href="#N_11_"><b>[[11]]</b></a> Marcus returned to Rome with the body and
gave his brother full honors.  He then turned north again and began his counterattacks against the
barbarians.  He did not know it at the time, but he was destined to spend most of his remaining
years on the northern frontier.  The only interlude was caused by revolt in the east.</p>
<p>We have no record of Marcus' ultimate intentions in these campaigns, yet the various stages were
clear.  First and foremost, the enemy had to be driven out of Italy and then into their own territory
beyond the Danube.  He strove to isolate the tribes and then defeat them
individually, so that the ultimate manpower superiority of the empire and its greater skill in
warfare and logistics could more easily be brought to bear.  It was a successful strategy, as one
tribe after another suffered defeat and reestablished ties with Rome.  But it was a time-consuming
and expensive operation, requiring the recruitment of two new legions, <i>II Italica</i> and <i>III Italica</i>,
the construction of many new camps, such as the legionary fortress at Regensburg, with success
accruing year by year.  He intended to create two new provinces, 
Marcomannia and Sarmatia, thereby eliminating the Hungarian Plain and the
 headwaters of the Elbe as staging areas for invasion.<a href="#N_12_"><b>[[12]]</b></a></p>
<p>This steady, slow progress was interrupted in 175 by the action of the distinguished general
<a href="avcass.html"><b>Avidius Cassius</b></a>, governor of Syria, who claimed the empire for himself.<a href="#N_13_"><b>[[13]]</b></a>  Whether he
responded to a rumor of Marcus' death or, as gossip had it, conspired with Marcus' wife, the
emperor's response was quick and decisive.  Leaving the northern wars, he traveled to the East,
but <a href="avcass.html"><b>Avidius</b></a> was killed before Marcus arrived in the region.  After spening
 time settling affairs
and showing himself to some of the provinces, with particular attention 
shown to Athens, where
he was initiated into the Eleusinian mysteries, as <a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian</b></a> and <a href="lverus.html"><b>Verus</b></a> had been.  He returned to Italy
and soon answered the call to duty once more on the northern frontier.   He took with him
as colleague his son <a href="commod.html"><b>Commodus</b></a>, now merely sixteen years old but already long since marked out
as his father's intended successor.  The military campaigns proved successful, but in the spring of
180, when Marcus died, at least one more year of warfare was necessary for the attainment of the
grand enterprise.  Marcus recommended to <a href="commod.html"><b>Commodus</b></a> continuation of the war, but the new
emperor was eager to return to Rome and the ease and luxury of the imperial court and entered
into a peace agreement.  Never again was Rome to hold the upper hand in its dealings with the
Germanic tribes beyond the now reestablished borders of the empire.</p>
<p><strong>Administrative and Religious Policy</strong></p>
<p>Marcus was a conscientious and careful administrator who devoted much attention to judicial
matters.<a href="#N_14_"><b>[[14]]</b></a>  His appointments to major administrative positions were for the most part
admirable.  Difficult tasks were put in the charge of the most capable men; he was not afraid of
comparison with his subordinates.  Social mobility continued as it had been under his
predecessors, with men from the provinces advancing into the upper echelons of the Roman
aristocracy.  Those of humble birth could make a good career; such a 
one was <a href="pertinax.html"><b>Pertinax </b></a>
(126-193)<a href="#N_15_"><b>[[15]]</b></a>, a gifted general, who in early 193 became emperor for a space of less than three
months.</p>
<p>The judicial administration of Italy was put in the hands of <em>iuridici</em>, who represented the emperor
and thus spoke with his authority.  This was a practice which had been established by <a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian</b></a> but
had been allowed to lapse by <a href="tonypis.html"><b>Antoninus</b></a>.  The centralization of government continued apace.  The
imperial finances were sorely stretched by the almost continuous wars.  <a href="trajan.html"><b>Trajan</b></a> had brought great
wealth, Decebalus' treasure, into the empire after his conquest of Dacia.  No such profit awaited
Marcus.  When preparing for the northern wars, he auctioned off much of the imperial palace's
valuables.<a href="#N_16_"><b>[[16]]</b></a>  In spite of the enormous expenses of war, <a href="commod.html"><b>Commodus</b></a> found ample funds upon
his accession as sole emperor for his expenditures and amusements.</p>
<p>Although Marcus was a devoted thinker and philosopher, he was deeply religious, at least
outwardly.  The state cult received full honor, and he recognized the validity of other people's
beliefs, so that the variety of religions in the vast extent of the empire caused no difficulties for
inhabitants or government, with one significant exception.  The Christians were not hampered by
any official policy; indeed the impact of the church spread enormously in the second century.  Yet
their availability as scapegoats for local crises made them subject to abuse or worse.  There was
violence against them in 167, and perhaps the worst stain on Marcus' principate stemmed from the
pogrom of Christians in Lugdunum in southern France in 177.  He did not cause it, nor, on the
other hand, did he or his officials move to stop it.  Indeed, Tertullian called him a friend of
Christianity. Yet the events were a precursor of what would come in the century and a quarter
which followed.<a href="#N_17_"><b>[[17]]</b></a><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Building Programs and Monuments</strong></p>
<p>Many of Marcus' predecessors transformed the face of the capital with their building
programs, either by the vast range of their undertaking or by the extraordinary significance of
individual monuments.  Others did very little to leave a tangible mark.  Marcus fell into the
latter group.  There is record of very few monuments for which he and his brother were
responsible.  Very early in their reign they honored the deceased <a href="tonypis.html"><b>Antoninus</b></a> with a column in the
Campus Martius, no longer <em>in situ</em> but largely surviving.  The shaft, which seems not to have been
sculpted, was used for the restoration of Augustus' obelisk, now in Piazza Montecitorio, in the
eighteenth century.  The base, which was sculpted on all four sides, is now on display in the
Vatican Museum.  The chief feature is the apotheosis of the emperor and his long deceased wife,
the elder Faustina, as they are borne to heaven.  Also presented on this relief are two eagles and
personifications of the goddess Roma and of the Campus Martius, represented as a young male
figure.</p>
<p>There were three arches which commemorated the military achievements of the two emperors. 
No trace has been found of an early monument to Verus.  Two arches later honored Marcus, both
of which have disappeared but have left significant sculptural remains.  The eight rectangular
reliefs preserved on the Arch of Constantine came from one arch.  Similarly, the three reliefs
displayed in the stairwell of the Conservatori Museum on the Capitoline Hill came from another. 
One relief has disappeared from the latter monument.</p>
<p>Certainly the best known monument of Marcus' principate is the column, which rises from Piazza
Colonna.  It is twin to <a href="trajan.html"><b>Trajan's</b></a> column in height and design, although the artistic craftsmanship of
the reliefs which envelop the shaft is much inferior.  The subject is Marcus' campaigns against the
Marcomanni and Sarmati in the years 172-75.  The most interesting panel represents the famous
rainstorm, when the army, overwhelmed by drought, was suddenly saved by the divine
intervention of rain.<a href="#N_18_"><b>[[18]]</b></a>  Although begun in the latter part of the decade, the column was not
completed until 193, when <a href="sepsev.html"><b>Septimius Severus</b></a> had become emperor.</p>
<p>The famous equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius, which survived the centuries near San Giovanni
in Laterano because the rider was identified as <a href="connniei.html"><b>Constantine</b></a>, no longer greets the visitor to the
Capitoline, where Michelangelo had placed it in the sixteenth century.  It was removed in the
1980s because pollution was destroying it.  After careful treatment and restoration, it is now
displayed within the museum, with a replica placed in the center of the piazza.</p>
<p>Although outside Rome, mention should be made of the monumental frieze commemorating
<a href="lverus.html"><b>Lucius Verus'</b></a> victory over the Parthians in 165.  It was an ornament of the city of Ephesus; the
extensive sculptural remains are now in the Ephesus Museum in Vienna.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Family </strong></p>
<p>As part of <a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian's</b></a> plans for his succession, when Ceionius Commodus was his choice, Marcus
was betrothed to the latter's daughter.  But when Ceionius died and <a href="tonypis.html"><b>Antoninus</b></a> became <a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian's</b></a>
successor, that arrangement was nullified and Marcus was chosen for the Emperor's daughter, the
younger Faustina (<em>PIR</em><sup>2</sup> A716).  She had been born in 129, was hence eight years younger than he. 
They were married in 145; the marriage endured for thirty years.  She bore him thirteen children,
of whom several died young; the most important were a daughter, Lucilla, and a son <a href="commod.html"><b>Commodus</b></a>. 
Lucilla was deployed for political purposes, married first to <a href="lverus.html"><b>Lucius Verus </b></a>in 164, when she was
seventeen, and then, after his death, to Claudius Pompeianus Quintianus of Antioch, a much older
man who was an important associate of her father (<em>PIR</em><sup>2</sup> C973).<a href="#N_19_"><b>[[19]]</b></a>  
<a href="commod.html"><b>Commodus</b></a> became joint-emperor with his father in 177 and three years later ruled alone.</p>
<p>Faustina's reputation suffered much abuse.  She was accused of employing poison and of
murdering people, as well as being free with her favors with gladiators, sailors, and also men of
rank, particularly <a href="avcass.html"><b>Avidius Cassius</b></a>.  Yet Marcus trusted her implicitly and defended her vigorously. 
She accompanied him on several campaigns and was honored with the title <em>mater castrorum</em>.  She
was with him in camp at Halala in southern Cappadocia in the winter of 175 when she died in an
accident.  Marcus dedicated a temple to her honor and had the name of the city changed to
Faustinopolis. <a href="#N_20_"><b>[[20]]</b></a>     </p>
<p><strong>Death and Succession</strong></p>
<p>In early 180, while Marcus and <a href="commod.html"><b>Commodus</b></a> were fighting in the north, Marcus became ill.  Which
disease carried him off we do not know, but for some days Marcus took no food or drink, being
now eager to die.<a href="#N_21_"><b>[[21]]</b></a>  He died on March 17, in the city of Vindobona, although one source
reports that it was in Sirmium.  His ashes were brought to Rome and placed in <a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian's</b></a>
mausoleum.  <a href="commod.html"><b>Commodus</b></a> succeeded to all power without opposition, and soon withdrew from the
war, thereby stymieing his father's designs and ambitions.  It was a change of rulers that proved
disastrous for people and empire.  Dio called the succession a change from a golden kingdom to
one of iron and rust.<a href="#N_22_"><b>[[22]]</b></a><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Reputation</strong> </p>
<p>Gibbon called Marcus "that philosophic monarch,"<a href="#N_23_"><b>[[23]]</b></a>  a combination of adjective and noun
which sets Marcus apart from all other Roman emperors.  His renown has, in subsequent
centuries, suffered little, although he was by no means a "perfect" person.  He was perhaps too
tolerant of other people's failings,<a href="#N_24_"><b>[[24]]</b></a> he himself used 
opium.<a href="#N_25_"><b>[[25]]</b></a>  The abundance of children whom his wife bore
him included, alas, a male who was to prove one of Rome's worst rulers.  How much better it
would have been if Marcus had had no son and had chosen a successor by adoption, so that the
line of the five good emperors,<a href="nerva.html"><b> Nerva</b></a>, <a href="trajan.html"><b>Trajan</b></a>, <a href="hadrian.html"><b>Hadrian</b></a>, <a href="tonypis.html"><b>Antoninus</b></a>, Marcus, could have been
extended.  It was not to be, and for that Marcus must accept some responsibility.</p>
<p>Yet he was a man of ability and a sense of duty who sacrificed his own delights and interests to
the well-being of the state.  He was <em>capax imperii</em>, he did his best, and history has been kind to
him.  As Hamlet said to Horatio, when awaiting the appearance of the ghost of his father,</p>
<p>"He was a man! Take him for all in all, 
I shall not look upon his like again." (I 2, 187-88)</p>
<p>His memory remains vivid and tactile because of the famous column, the equestrian statue, and his
slender volume of thoughts, written in Greek, the <em>Meditations</em>,<a href="#N_26_"><b>[[26]]</b></a> from which I choose two
quotations with which to conclude:</p>

<p>"If mind is common to us, then also the reason, whereby 
we are reasoning beings, is common.  If this be so,  
then also the reason which enjoins what is to be done 
or left undone is common.  If this be so, law also is 
common; if this be so, we are citizens; if this be so, 
we are partakers in one constitution; if this be so, 
the Universe is a kind of Commonwealth." (4.4)</p>
<p>"At dawn of day, when you dislike being called, have 
this thought ready: 'I am called to man's labour; why 
then do I make a difficulty if I am going out to do 
what I was born to do and what I was brought 
into the world for?" (5.1; both in Farquharson's
translation)</p>
